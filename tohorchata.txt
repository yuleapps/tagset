Temeraire - Naomi Novik 
Tenzing Tharkay, Sipho Tsuluka Dlamini, Emily Roland, William Laurence

There are SO MANY fics I might like to see in this fandom, and those characters I listed are all options - you don't have to try to put all of them in. Ship-wise, I'm very fond of Laurence/Tharkay and Emily/Demane, but gen is just as good. Do Not Wants include noncon and unleavened bleakness.

I'd be happy with any fic you'd like to write within those parameters, but if you would like prompts, here are some!

1. Tharkay adjusting to his new life. How does he deal with being responsible for the land and its tenants? Does this mean he has to deal with other gentry now? What do people think of his permanent guests, Laurence and Temeraire? Does he get sucked into Temeraire's political career by sheer proximity? Does Lady Allendale involve herself? Are his cousins still plotting to sell him out to the French?

2. Sipho's continuing education. Basically I would just love to see fic where Sipho's tutelage under Temeraire continues until he ends up in university and becomes the world-class cartographer and natural philosopher we know he will be one day.

3. Emily and Demane making it work. Sailors made it work; who says aviators can't? (Okay, Emily's mum, but she's a bit biased.)

4. Laurence's retirement. Exactly how long does that last before more adventures happen to him?

I honestly got so fond of Charon in this game, and was really fascinated by his code of conduct. I'd love something exploring Charon's partnership with the Lone Wanderer. Personally, I played a female protag who erred on the side of altruism, but however you play it, he's watching this kid pull off some crazy stuff. What's his perspective?

Westworld (TV) 
William (Westworld)

Okay, I'm going to do my darnedest not to spoil anything for innocent bystanders, so away we go!

William's my favorite character (I love the different facets of him we get to see, his all-consuming need for meaning, and the idea that even virtues can become destructive if taken to extremes) and I'm most interested in his development following his first visit to the park. I'd love to see more of the \"real world\"--his home life, corporate maneuverings at Delos--and how his perception of these things changes as a result of his time in Westworld. (That said, if you want to write a story that takes place solely in the park, go right ahead.) How does he get from the person he is at the end of his initial arc to the man he'll ultimately become? (You don't have to answer that, obviously--but I'd love to see one of the steps along the way.)

I love William's relationships with Dolores, Lawrence, and Logan, and would also be really interested in learning about his family. But really, include whoever you like--tell me about him meeting Ford for the first time, for instance.

I also really dig the way the show plays with time and memory, so a more experimental approach would be great too! Anything that expands on the ideas or world of the show--there's so much that's hinted at, or just left open to explore--would be phenomenal.

Baby Driver (2017) 
Baby | Miles

So my favorite scene in the movie is the one where Baby's getting coffee. It was such a fascinating glimpse at the way his mind works and the world he inhabits--I'd adore anything that could capture that feeling.

I'm also intrigued by Baby's past (I'm a sucker for childhood flashbacks)--I'd love to read about the first time he met Doc, car-theft-related shenanigans, or a musical discovery he made when he was younger (bonus points if you manage to incorporate car-theft-related shenanigans). His relationship with Joe is wonderful, I'd love anything about them--pre- or post-movie. And if you'd rather write about someone else, go for it!

I also love car chases (go figure) and stories with a strong sense of place, so if you just wanted to write about Baby zipping around Atlanta, I would be absolutely fine with that.

Mad Men 
Don Draper, Sally Draper

Sally is the Mad Men character whose post-finale fate I'm most interested (and invested! please let things turn out moderately okay for her!) in. I'd really love to see how she evolves as a person, and how that affects her relationship (or lack thereof) with Don. I can imagine all kinds of futures for her, and I'd love to read about either one possibility in particular or a five-things-type exploration of different paths she could take. I'm also interested in how she comes to terms with her own past, as well as Don's (what she knows of it--how much does he wind up telling her about himself? is there anything she finds out on her own?).

If futurefic isn't your thing, a Sally-and-Don moment set during the show would be fantastic, too--maybe sometime between seasons 3 and 4 (the first time he sees the kids after the divorce?), or Don sharing something about himself with (or being reminded of something about himself by) her.

Hut 33 

f you can get the humour of this, I will love you and everything about this series. The quasi-Blackadder of it makes me extremely happy, so should you wish to transpose the setting/context Blackadder-style and AU it, that is perfect. Minka delights me, as does Charles, as does everyone, but I'm as happy with a single Archie-perspective read as with a series-style script, so whatever method takes your fancy. I'd love the team to actually succeed at something important, whether by design or mistake, or I'd also be really happy with an improvised festive time with this. Again, more in letter!

As above, really! Again, it's the sheer bloody-minded fun of it amidst the most head-bangingly frustrating characters. I love when Bernard actually has to engage with the art of bookselling, either by buying more books, or doing tax returns, or anything else...I'm imagining him trying to deal with the influx of YA into publishing (perhaps he is an unexpected fan? At the very least he ought to love The Hunger Games), author visits, cardboard promotional material that doesn't fit together properly, the Christmas rush, the very notion that the British public are once more reading and buying books from bookshops...I would love any kind of bookish geekery.

Again, I'm also super here for any weird AU/crossover/crack. I love all the characters, and really, the whole everything

Amelia Peabody - Elizabeth Peters 
Amelia Peabody Emerson, Radcliffe Emerson

Amelia and Emerson are such wonderful characters. I love Amelia’s strength and her foibles, her idiosyncrasies and her fabulously distinct narrative voice, her love for Emerson and her love for archaeology. Meanwhile Emerson’s love for Amelia is so manifestly evident at all times and endearing (plus I love his own archaeological fervor). And their banter, conversational style, working together, arguments, and reconciliations are all so much fun to read about. If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): How about a story about their relationship over the years – perhaps five times Peabody rescued Emerson and one time Emerson rescued Peabody, maybe? (Or vice-versa.) (Five-times fic in general is great.) Or maybe they have an adventure together that didn’t get recorded in the books. Or maybe one of them is writing an article about best archaeological practices and the other provides input. ;) Or perhaps you’d like to write a story from Emerson’s POV (either first-person or third-person is great).

If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): What adventures might Harry and Corlath have together after their marriage? What's Narknon's perspective on their relationship? How might they solve a mystery together? Do they ever visit Ihistan and/or Harry's homeland together? Or what about an AU in which Corlath doesn't kidnap Harry, or an AU in which Harry and Senay are the ones who fall in love?

Tell me a story about Polly! If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :)

A few prompts (more in my letter): What's Miss Snelgrove’s POV of Polly’s career at Townsend Brothers? How might Polly and Eileen have fallen in love? (And did Binnie ever figure it out?)

Jewish Scripture & Legend 
Naomi (Jewish Scripture & Legend), Rut | Ruth (Jewish Scripture & Legend)

Naomi and Ruth are one of my earliest ships. I think Ruth’s speech is one of the most beautiful ever written, and it’s no coincidence that it appears in so many romantic contexts (and is often used in wedding ceremonies). As a young, childless widow of marriageable age, it would have made so much more sense for Ruth to return to her family, as Orpah did. To journey into a foreign land with another widow, without any male support, where they would struggle on the margins of society? (The reason Naomi and her husband had originally left Judah was because there was a famine there, after all.) To cleave to Naomi was a brave choice indeed for Ruth, but she makes it so passionately and with such conviction. Then she supports Naomi by going out to glean, and when she marries Naomi’s relative (with Naomi’s urging) and has a child, does the village say “Boaz has had a son”? No, they say “There is a son born to Naomi,” and Naomi cradles him in her bosom. ♥

While I have no problem with historical detail if that’s what you are excited about writing, I also don’t mind at all if you blur/handwave the historical accuracy (or if you take Ruth and Naomi’s story out of its context entirely, in the case of my AU prompts).

See my letter for specific prompts. :)

Ben 'Light Boy', Johnny (Dare (2005))

I love the ambiguity in this! I love Johnny's badness! His seductiveness! I love the tension! I love how it sort of drops off at such a point where you don't know what would have happened next. Do they return to form, ignoring each other, or even turning hostile? Do they meet again in secret? Can Ben ever get over his lust? Is Johnny capable of being more authentic and true to himself? Could they become friends, or more? There's a push/pull dynamic that's really sexy for such a short piece. I'd love to see a scenario where the tables are turned--where Ben is out and happy with himself, and it's Johnny, still closeted, but envious of Ben's freedom, who makes the first move. I'd love to see Ben string him along a bit. But really, anything more with these two will make me super happy. There's nothing like two hot guys, some ambiguity, and some splashy-sexy times.

They're also gearing up to make a sequel next year, yay! So that's another tack you could take--Jonnny and Ben, years later, meeting up again for a dip in the pool. Is Ben Johnny's dirty little secret? Or do they happen to meet randomly, only for sparks to fly once more?

Would Walsh even seem charming next to a bunch of other Reptilians? What would Ozzie think of Walsh's homeworld? Does Walsh's homeworld even exist anymore? Does Jeff's? What's with the cover memories involving deer? And what made them choose deer? What other fun-sexy advanced technology to aliens have access to? Why does Walsh prefer his human suit? Oh, or what if they ended up on Jonathan's homeworld and Ozzie had to pretend to be his slave/pet/boyfriend/husband/boss? What if, according to Reptilian status markers, Jonathan's considered a real nobody because he has to work on Earth? What if they get to ~Reptileworld and Ozzie's super popular for some reason? Or what if Jonathan's actually capable of babies? Go wild, I say! This is the canon for just about anything. :) 

And I love the whole cast, so though I'd love Jonathan and Ozzie (and Jonathan/Ozzie), feel free to have fun with everyone else. More of Don's lightning-fast processing of emotions, more of Nancy's random feminism, more of Yvonne's weapons EVERYWHERE. Just--moar, please!

Suikoden III 

Suikoden 3 is my favorite RPG of all time in terms of its worldbuilding. The realistic qualities of the world, in both the overall plot and the small details - racist innkeepers! Real, serious emotional trauma from war! An alliance that is fragile and, ultimately, broken! - still fascinate me, despite the game being 16 years old. What I'm most interested in seeing is what canon teases but, ultimately, denies us - a chance to see the future, past Suikoden III. I'm particularly interested in how the characters have grown and changed in the tumultuous, war-ravaged world. How does Chris cope with the war with Tinto, especially with things as fragile as they are in the Grasslands? How does Zexen as a whole deal with their Knight Captain never aging, eternally youthful? How do Thomas and/or Cecile hold on to Budehuc - or do they not, and are left desperately trying to find a place that would accept them? How would Chris feel to see an older Thomas and Cecile as soldiers signing on for a war? How does Geddoe feel about how things are left in the Grassland? Does anything change in his troops after his friends find out his true origins? 

In terms of ships, I would prefer Thomas/Cecile. I tend to ship Chris with Salone and Geddoe with Queen, but I am alright with gen for any of the four nominated characters as well but would prefer not to see the character(s) in other ships. (Past relationships is fine.)

The Good Place (TV) 

The Good Place is a show that has come and absolutely stolen my heart this season. I absolutely adore the characters, the setting, and the mythology of the show. I'm most interested in an exploration of how things change over the many, many times Michael has wiped the Main 4's memories - how do they handle it when they get deja vu? How do the demons handle having to keep their stories straight time and time again? Does Trevor come in to assist? What happens to those who Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani/Jason left behind? Does Jason ever get corrupted from how much Michael is rebooting her? Will Janet and Jason ever fall in love again? Has Janet ever figured out she is in hell? How does the soul-mate switch up affect the crew over those many reboots? What was the magic panda? Did the Seduce Michael plan actually work?  How long have they been in hell, anyway?

I'm staying current on the show so please do not worry about spoilers. In terms of ships, I basically ship the entire cast with one another, but I'm especially fond of Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Michael. Would not say no to pretty much any combination of the main 4 + Janet/Michael/Trevor. No problem with demon or computer/human. Am also open to gen for any.

Atomic Blonde (2017) 
Lorraine Broughton, Emmett Kurzfeld, Delphine Lasalle

I quite liked Atomic Blonde in theaters this year. I'm all for spy on spy action, and the canonical femslash pleased me greatly. I'm mostly looking for fic playing on the lack of trust inherent in these relationships; how do you trust anyone, or love anyone, in a time so bleak as the cold war? What makes them want to be spies? Are they loyal to their countries? One another? Why was the CIA double-crossing the British? Why was Lorraine a triple agent? Was Delphine a baby spy, or was there more to her than how she presented herself? 

In terms of ships, I would love Kurtzfeld/Lorraine or Delphine/Lorraine but I am open to gen as well.

Suicide Squad (2016) 
Harleen Quinzel (Suicide Squad (2016)), Floyd Lawton (Suicide Squad 2016)

I loved Suicide Squad. It's so cartoonishly grimy and fun and I love the idea of these villains not only getting a hero turn in some cases but also showing that they're not, entirely, their bad actions. In particular, I thought Floyd/Deadshot being both a murderous killer <i>and</i> a very dedicated father was a really interesting turn on his character; I also enjoyed seeing Harley's secret desire being having a family with the Joker, so naturally what I'd <i>really</i> like to see is Harley/Deadshot with a family focus. How would they get together? How would Harley react to Deadshot's daughter? What would happen when the Joker or Batman got word of this? 

I only want Deadshot/Harley in terms of pairings, but I'm open to them having been with other people in the past. I'm also fine with villains being villains, or if you want to make them turn over a new leaf, that's fine too. I'm just interested in the journey.

Crazyhead (TV) 
Raquel Francis, Suzanne (Crazyhead), Amy (Crazyhead)

Crazyhead is a show that's so short but <i>so good</i>! I'm a huge fan of the entire female cast and would love more adventures together, especially post-canon since it doesn't seem like we'll ever see a Season 2. How did Suzanne come back to life after throwing herself out of the window? How do Raquel and Amy patch up their relationship after the distrust and the drugging etc? Are the demons still gunning for them, now that Callum is gone? 

I love any combination of the main three here, whether it's gen or shippy.

NieR: Automata (Video Game) 
2B (NieR: Automata), 9S (NieR: Automata), A2 (NieR: Automata), Anemone (NieR: Automata)

NieR is a game I didn't think would punch me as hard in the feels as it did. I'm really fascinated by its androids, still fighting an endless war for the sake of and against a people that no longer exist. Mostly I feel terrible for the main cast, who are all so traumatized. A part of me wants happier fluff, and another part of me wants to revel in sadness, so whether fluff or dark-fic, you'll make me happy. Mostly I'm looking for the connections between the characters nominated - How do their relationships grow and change, especially with so much going on around them? How does 2B react to killing 9S and seeing him, again and again and again? How does Anemone react to re-meeting A2? How does Anemone see the YorHa units - or  A2? How does 9S start to see the world once his sanity starts slipping - particularly 2B, A2, and Anemone? 

In terms of ships, I prefer 2B/9S and A2/Anemone, but I am open to gen for all as well.

What I'd really love is a story where Duncan and Owen make out, could be that summer - Duncan's never been kissed, and wants to practice before he tries it on Susanna - or Duncan could come back to work another summer at the park. I also really love the found family vibe of the park employees, and would be into some sort of \"it takes a village to raise a child\" story about Caitlin and her baby.

Northern Exposure 
Chris Stevens, Ed Chigliak, Holling Vincoeur, Shelly Tambo

I would really love something that goes even more into the magical realism of the show (double, triple the strange magical things! Go full-out Night Vale! Actually going full-out Night Vale with it is something I would be SUPER into). Character-wise, if you wanted to get kind of epistolary with Chris - like radio show excerpts mixed into the narrative - that would be amazing. I would also be excited about a Chris/Ed of any sort, gen Chris+Ed having some sort of adventure (maybe a road trip?), or Shelly/Holling just because I find them adorable together.

I saw this for the first time a few months ago and thought, \"I need fix-it fic where Mitch dies instead of Annie, and Annie goes with Melanie at the end.\" This could be Annie+Melanie friendship, or Annie/Melanie. (Sorry, Mitch, it's not like you're horrible or anything but I was annoyed that Annie died saving your sister.) Other ideas: I didn't nominate Mitch, but if you felt like writing Annie/Melanie/Mitch, I would be down with that. Or any of the tropes listed in my letter, really, as long as Annie doesn't die!

2) Reuben's \"I have some remaindered furniture I want to send you\" screams sugar daddy to me. Please tell me more about his relationships with Danny and Rusty when they were younger. Platonic or sexual/romantic, it doesn't matter to me.
3) \"the thing with the guy in the place\" - What did Danny and Rusty do for Reuben in Belize? Maybe only Rusty had to go to Belize for the thing, and Danny was doing his part somewhere else? Did they con someone, steal something, or maybe steal something back? I doubt Reuben is one to tell people he owes them lightly, so it must have really been something.

Really, if you're not entirely comfortable writing the Napoleonic era version of these guys, an AU of any sort would be great. (How about Jack Aubrey as Danny Ocean? I'm only slightly joking.) Either Jack/Stephen or Jack+Stephen as friends devoted to each other works for me, and if you'd also like to include Diana that would also be cool.

Chronicles of Amber - Roger Zelazny 
Corwin (Chronicles of Amber), Deirdre (Chronicles of Amber)

I'm very fond of Corwin as narrator and in general, and I really wished we could have gotten more of Deirdre than canon gave us (and I hate only realizing I ship something when one half abruptly dies!) so I would be delighted to receive a story that focuses on them, or on one of them with the other in a supporting role. With all those centuries, even before Corwin's stint as an amnesiac on Earth there's a lot of time canon didn't cover or barely glossed over in which adventures, learning experiences and heartbreaks must have been happening. 

I would rather not receive a story focusing heavily on Deirdre's canonical death-- stories set before then or handwaving it would be my preference at this time.

Gen or het with their current/past partners is fine.

I don't see these two in a romantic light, and I don't see either one as they type to cheat on their mates. But if they happened to meet before they were mated, then I could see them having a fling. Nothing serious, though, and I think it would largely be about the two of them testing one another for dominance. Or possibly Asil testing Bran (somehow I see Asil as younger, but who even knows if that's true).

A roadtrip lecture tour, with all the joys of Victorian travel. One or more of them meets the Quacks-version of another famous Victorian. Sharing wildly over the top stories about what they did during the war. Caroline and Robert's wedding night, which goes as well as expected. They're invited to a party at Nicola's new house. The zombie apocalypse happens, and none of them are taking it as seriously as they should. It's Christmas and there might be ghosts, but it could just be drugs.

Hark! A Vagrant 
Dr. Sara Josephine Baker (Hark! A Vagrant)

I agonized over whether to nominate this under Hark! A Vagrant (which is, after all, the only reason I ever found out about Dr. Sara Josephine Baker in the first place) or as some kind of RPF fandom (since it's the real-life details from her wikipedia page that REALLY ignited my interest in a possible yuletide story!). In the end I decided to nominate under Hark! A Vagrant mostly because I didn't feel like I could come up with a sensible RPF category/label. :-P

So! IN ADDITION to all the awesome public health accomplishments of Dr. Baker that we learn about in the comic, wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Josephine_Baker#Personal_life) also tells me that she lived with two other women, one of whom 'identified as a \"woman-oriented woman.\"' !!!!!  So naturally I'm interested in the possibility of a Sarah Josephine Baker/Ida Alexa Ross Wylie/Louise Pearce threesome (in whatever romantic/sexual/platonic configuration may be pleasing to you to write :-)).

I'm not an expert on the relevant history or anything--I pretty much just know what's in the comic and the wikipedia page--so, uh, don't feel any need to be any more \"historically accurate\" than the comic itself. :-P If you want to go for the same kind of tone as the comic, that's cool! If you are a secret expert in the history, I will admire! If you'd be interested in exploring some other kind of setting or approach entirely (ex.: lesbian public health doctor in SPAAAAAACE)--also cool!

Beautiful Losers II - Jack Vettriano 
Woman (Beautiful Losers II), Standing Man (Beautiful Losers II), Seated Man (Beautiful Losers II)

You can see this artwork here! https://www.jackvettriano.com/exhibitions/lovers-strangers/beautiful-losers-ii-3/

This picture just tells such a story, doesn't it? I'd love to see more of it. :-)

Threesomes are my jam. This doesn't necessarily *have to* be a sexy threesome story, but that would be very welcome if you are so inclined! Whether they're already all three in an established relationship together, or a couple bringing in a friend as a third (and if so, which pair are the couple!), or some other possibility is up to you. I do have a fondness for some degree of established relationship--the comfortableness with each other that that can bring--but I have certainly also read reams of fanfic about first times, so I'm not exactly opposed to that, either. :-)

I will say, from the body language it seems like the woman might not be entirely happy to be there... but I do prefer my threesomes happy, or at least in overall happy relationships even if the immediate situation isn't happy. Maybe she could be upset about something else, and they could be comforting her? Or something else--you don't need to feel wedded to the idea that she's unhappy at all--I just wanted to mention my take on what seemed like it might be an obvious interpretation of the picture.

Request 4 by Age or Wizardry (ageorwizardry)
Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Marge Sherwood

Consider Marge. Consider how Marge is absolutely right about Tom Ripley in the end. Consider how no one will believe her because the old boys' club would rather draw together to protect even someone who murdered one of its own sons than take a woman seriously. Consider Marge returning home from Europe, grieving, betrayed. Consider what she does next. Consider how she picks the pieces of her life back up again.

Consider the book she's been writing since before she ever met Tom Ripley, or even Dickie Greenleaf. Consider what kind of book she might be working on, what work she would consider so important—and take it seriously, because she does, even if no one else does. Consider whether the direction of her work would change after her experiences in Europe, and if so, how.

Consider her eventually being vindicated about the nature of Tom Ripley. Or, alternately, consider her living so well that he recedes ever smaller in the rear-view mirror of her life.

Consider Marge.

And then tell me something about her.

This request is primarily based on the movie, but I have read the books as well (although it was several years ago now). Feel free to incorporate or disregard anything you wish from the books—for instance, we know what Marge's book is about in the books, but there's no need for that to be the same in the movie/your story, unless you want it to be.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) 
Bella (Hunt for the Wilderpeople)

I really enjoyed this movie, but I was disappointed that it was Yet Another Story whose plot was kicked off by a woman's death. I'd love to see an AU where Bella didn't die--and whether their ordinary lives continue together on the upward trend you could expect, or they still (somehow??) manage to wind up in some of the wacky adventures they have in the movie is up to you. Or pre-movie Bella backstory--or whatever takes your fancy! I'd just love for Bella to have more room to breathe in a story that doesn't treat her as expendable.

The Alexandria Archives (Podcast) 
Morning Wood (Alexandria Archives), Gore (Alexandria Archives)

If you're new to this fandom, the Alexandria Archives is a fun cute podcast that's basically a college AU of the Cthulhu Mythos (alexandriaarchives.com) and it's an easy listen if you'd like to check it out!

I really like Morning Wood but I hate her DJ call name so I'd love something explaining it or telling us what MW's real name is, haha.

I'd also be pleased with a day in the life of Gore, vampire, not really on campus. What does he do with his days (or nights?) What's up with his \"Canadian\" roommate? How is he doing shaking off his ex? When we last left her she seemed a bit jealous of MW — although also they both liked each other. Does she have a reason to be jealous? (I'd love MW/Gore if you're so inclined!)

Alternately anything exploring the school and its background and its cast of creepy characters and landmarks would be great. You can build on any of the story-within-a-story of the individual eps (that first episode with the sever room, for example!!!! or the SWAMP), or follow any of the other characters around — really, it's all good!

Once on this Island - Flaherty/Ahrens 

I love this musical, it's one of my all-time favorites, and I'd love absolutely anything you chose to do with the mythology, the worldbuilding, or any of the characters! Want to turn all the characters into plants? Be my guest! Want to explore the antics of the gods and goddesses? Great. Want to show a conversation between Timoune and Papa Ge as she bargains to keep her life? Perfect. Want to explore what happens to the girl and boy at the end of the story who are set free by Timoune's sacrifice to love and unite the island? I would be overjoyed. &lt;3333 Even if you just want to do a look at the customs and the traditions of the people on the island, or a character study, or something experimental, or anything that's not particularly plotty — seriously, anything. I'd be delighted.

I feel like I ask for this fandom every other year I've done Yuletide, haha, and I really just would love it if someone else who loves it too comes along and cares to extend a lovely story and/or a gorgeous fascinating universe a bit further.

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

So basically I just want Alex and Dr. Strand fighting and fucking, in no particular order.

But, it would be a cool bonus if Alex has to actually deal with the conflict of interest she courts by falling in love with the subject of her reporting, because the extent to which she's willing to muddy personal/ethical lines on this show drives me crazy, haha.

Also another thing that drives me crazy about this show is the extent to which it has inverted the concepts of 'open-mindedness' and 'skepticism' by having Alex constantly comment that she is skeptical of the ability with which Strand easily explains away things she herself doesn't understand. That! is not! how skepticism works! He is easily dismissive of things because there's no practical/physical/tangible evidence for them which is the essence of skepticism; you don't get to be skeptical of a skeptic's skepticism when you are only basing your own observations on \"but i saw X happen with my own eyes\" even if it is scary and impressive and convincing! and, like, oh my god, this drives me batty. I just want him to like explain the scientific method to her until she gets it. Maybe while eating her out.

Alternately, i would love to see more of *her* skepticism and critical thinking on display, maybe in a follow-up to the end of S2? But in the end, I'm really not picky about the details or where in the timeline it takes place; I just really want Alex and Dr. Strand fucking and fighting, in no particular order. :D

Early Edition 
Gary Hobson, Marissa Clark, Toni Brigatti, Zeke Crumb

NOTE: Though I've requested all four nominated characters, with this character set I'm fine with you leaving one or two of them out, or giving one or two of the characters less screentime than your main focus. Gary and Marissa are my OTBFFs, Gary/Toni = OTP of my 14-year-old heart, and Crumb interacting with any or all of those three is always gold. The fact that the show never had Toni and Marissa together for more than three forking seconds is a damn tragedy. So seriously, any combination will work.

I'll always love a story in which Gary and Marissa negotiate how to take care of the paper and run the bar and have personal lives while being occasionally exasperated BFFs (while, meanwhile, Crumb both does and does not want to know how Gary predicts the future). I would never object to bantery romance and/or sexytimes between Gary and Toni. You could give them all a paper-based problem or one of Toni's or Crumb's cases to tackle (or a heist!) if you want to go with something plotty. 

DNWs are rape and non-consensual sex, abuse or serious harm of children, graphic violence, major character death, and depictions of real-life tragedies. See my letter for more details and prompts.

In Plain Sight 
Mary Shannon, Marshall Mann

Partnership is the best ship, and US Marshals make for fascinating partners. I would love an episodic story about Mary and Marshall and one or more of their witnesses getting into and/or out of trouble, an exploration of a trope like a road trip, bed sharing, trapped in a small space, or even an AU like a noir detective story or a time loop fic. I also would not object to a fix-it fic that repairs the damage the finale did to their friend/partner ship. Whether or not you want to make them romantic partners is up to you—I'm okay with them being BFFs forever, or with their friendship growing into something more romantic.

Feel free to include other characters from the show if you'd like, especially Stan, but I'd prefer the focus be on Mary and Marshall.

What was she like as a child; what stories did she imagine and play at with her brothers? How did Neverland change her? What pearl does she make of the bit of grit left in her by her adventure there? Can she fly without Peter's help afterward? Does she find her way back to Neverland, or to other imaginary realms as she grows up? Does she grow up and work for the better world she can imagine? Go as wildly off-canon as you want for this request and do whatever you want to give Wendy a better, happier story.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Bedivere (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I don't need all three characters to appear together, just any two! My letter has general likes, as well as a Arthur/Mage smut prompt, if you want more details than are in these prompts.

Arthur &amp; Bedivere: Bedivere comparing Arthur to Uther, developing respect between the two of them. Sparring? Would not be opposed to past Bedivere/Uther and how that affects Bedivere’s interactions with Arthur.

Bedivere &amp; The Mage: Bedivere knew who she was/that she was coming. What did he know? How did he know she was coming? What were those first weeks like, as they were planning the rescue? How did the Mage settle into the rebellion?

Bedivere &amp; Arthur &amp; The Mage: some early Table difficulties! I can see Bedivere and the Mage being the most important advisors to Arthur as he’s getting started, since Bedivere was in charge of the rebellion and was a high ranking knight in Uther’s army and the Mage is obviously an expert in a field with not a lot of experts. Something about Bedivere’s experience with the Dark Lands and him telling the two of them about it? 

Arthur/Mage, SFW: He let her bite him with a snake. What else would he let her do? Any explorations of that trust, or post-movie anything about her getting a seat at the Table would be great.

General likes and smut prompts are in my letter. Otherwise, here are a few of my prompts!

Dorothy/Lucas: during or post-canon, or canon-AU. I’m still peeved that Dorothy wasn’t the Beast Forever, so anything that switched that up so she is would be greatly appreciated! The return to Oz, the awkward first night. Lucas’ thoughts while he’s strung up. Anything, really!

West/Tip: anything to do with assuming the throne and having to be Ozma when he’s in public, West as the loyal right hand witch.

Dorothy &amp; West: witchy bonding? magic worldbuilding?

Tip &amp; Lucas: Did Tip send Lucas to retrieve Dorothy? I’d love to see how that went down. Did Lucas ask to be sent after Dorothy? Was West the one who sent him?

Lucas &amp; West: this is kind of a wildcard to me! did they know each other pre-series? how does West feel about Glinda’s hypocrisy in having a husband? do Lucas and West bond over being happiest when they have someone to serve?

General DNWs: on-screen/gratuitous/explicit rape, trauma to eyes or teeth, pregnancy, kid-fic, de-aging, crack, mpreg, A/B/O, kink treated like part of the structure of the world, mundane AUs, Christmas

General likes and some smut prompts are in my letter. I would love to read about Anderson playing off of any other character, so I've only requested her, but would be happy to have her interacting with anyone! And if you just want to Anderson on her own, I'd love case-fic! Her first case by herself, maybe? Or her backstory/the discovery of her powers/her time in Academy?

Anderson &amp; MaMa: Anderson doesn’t believe in ghosts but Madeline Madrigal haunts her all the same. Is it guilt? A psychic imprint of her last moments? Up to you!

Anderson &amp; Dredd: case-fic, or post-case fic. Patching up each other’s wounds. Dealing with psychic migraines during a case. Being teamed up together after a while apart and Dredd’s unsurprised and (seemingly) unimpressed at how much Anderson’s improved because he totally expected her to but she wants him to be proud anyway and doesn’t realize that he is?

Anderson &amp; Clan Techie: I’d be interested in a follow-up – how do they think about each other? if you want this to be shippy, i’m not opposed, but I’m thinking more along the lines of Anderson had to do a lot of killing, and the Techie is one person she was able to save, and the Techie probably remembers her. Do they meet again? Do they want to? this would be a more introspective fic, i think, though i’d love it if you could work it around action/daily life. I don’t think there’s a lot of time to stop and think and decompress in Mega City One.

Legion (TV) 
David Haller

Gen or any pairings are fine!

- What the fuck happened to David after the season finale?? Whose weird floaty metal ball prison thing was that and where did it take him?

- Division 3 can't be the only ones out there investigating and experimenting on mutants. How about a classic X-Men mutants-on-the-run kind of story but with this group of weirdos with mostly impractical abilities.

- David has the potential to do amazingly fucked up shit with his powers. What happens when he discovers his true potential? What if he enjoys the power a bit too much? Maybe he decides he can compromise with the Shadow King instead of defeat him, or maybe David consumes Farouk and loses control with their combined power. Just how much damage can he cause and is he even aware that he's doing it?

- David meets his father. I actually can't imagine what would happen if this version of David met either movie version of Xavier, but I love the idea of two of the strongest mutants in this universe - a father and son who don't even know each other - finally meeting. I figure either shit will go horribly wrong and/or they'll find a way to work things out.

Sense8 (TV) 
Lito Rodriguez, Sun Bak, Will Gorski, Wolfgang Bogdanow

I only requested a few characters, but I'm happy with any of the cluster, any pairings, any rating level. Feel free to bring in any of the supporting cast too, but I'd prefer the focus be on at least one of the cluster. I'm good with happily ever after or something more melancholy - including outright tragedy. I'm not interested in exploring issues of real world discrimination, but sensorium vs humans would be cool. 

- How the cluster rescues Wolfgang. The season finale was fucking brutal and I want to know what the rest of their mad plan was to get Wolfgang back.

- Or if you want to break my heart (go for it!), maybe they fail and the cluster has to deal with losing one of their own. How do eight become seven (or fewer)? Hell, go all out and give me the last sensate standing, alone, without their cluster (and then my family will wonder why I'm crying on Christmas and I'll babble about beautiful tragic fanfic).

- Winter holidays with the cluster! If you're in the mood for something fluffier, I love holidays and people coming together as families of different stripes. Even if they're a world apart and come from very different traditions and religions. One of my favorite things about the show is how often they celebrate with each other: all different kinds of events and festivals where they're there for one another.

- Some ideas focused on specific characters: Sun gets her revenge, one way or another. Lito becomes the movie star he was meant to be, with Hernando and Daniela at his side. Nomi and Amanita's wedding goes off with a bang. Will and Riley rebuild their lives. Capheus climbs the political ladder, for good or ill. Wolfgang figures the best way to deal with all this organized crime nonsense is to either control it all or wash his hands of it forever, with or without Kala.

- The world thinks both Matt Murdock and the Devil of Hell's Kitchen are dead. How does anyone come back from this? In other words, either about the Defenders moving on without him or literally about his return from the supposed dead.

- Matt and Jessica are the best snarky assholes. They decide to put their respective skills to good use together to save a person/their fiends/the city. Eye rolling and ass kicking ensue. I'm imagining gen here, but I'm open to being sold on them ending up in bed together (I can totally picture Jessica mocking the devil costume while trying to get Matt out of it)!

- You can't punch your way out of all fights, but it's kind of the only thing the Defenders know how to do.

- Jessica and Luke eventually figure their shit out and that they are best together. [Note: I love Claire but I find Luke/Claire not very exciting so I'd ask that you break them up kindly.]

- Luke/Danny porn. Against a wall, over furniture, grabbing, biting. Super strength/invulnerability meets harnessed qi. Most likely awkward and rough, but maybe something they both need. Feel free to throw Matt in here too, why not. 

Do Not Wants: D/s, mundane/modern AUs, kidfic, pregnancy, incest, 2nd person POV, soulbonds/soulmates, jealousy, A/B/O, spanking, issuefic.

Goon (2011) 
Xavier LaFlamme, Doug Glatt

There just isn't that much shippy fic about these two - I'm all in for fluffy romance or smut, I'm not fussy.  I haven't included Eva as a required character but I am happy for her to be included in a poly triad or full on OT3 or not as the filler chooses.

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 
Corran Horn (Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types)

This was my very first fandom and I fondly recall reading fanfic of it back in the day but so little seems to have survived.  Corran was always my favourite character and I'd love to read anything involving him, especially anything during the events of the Allston books when the canonical focus moves to the Wraiths - we get a couple of anecdotes about Corran but it would be good to read more.  Or anything involving his recovery from being held on the Lusankya, which gets glossed over in the books.

Washington Capitals RPF 
Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

Backstrom is my favourite player on the Caps - he doesn't get the limelight like some other players but he's always there getting the job done.  I would probably be happy with anything involving him but something shippy with another Caps player would be great.  I don't have a long list of DNW but must have a happy ending, no ongoing infidelity or bashing of real life relationships and no non-hockey AUs.  I'm totally good with ABO and similar type AUs and I absolutely love magical realism done with these guys.

Vegas Golden Knights RPF 
Marc-Andre Fleury (Vegas Golden Knights RPF), James Neal (Vegas Golden Knights RPF)

As sad as am I for Flower to have left the Penguins, at least Vegas seem to have got off to a good start.  Since Flower and Neal have been reunited in Vegas and both seem to be starting off hot, I'd love a story about them helping each other adjust.  Would be happy with gen but something of a more shippy, or even smutty nature, would be great.  If smutty, would prefer if real life relationships were acknowledged but no cheating (open relationship, one-off agreement, or whatever).  I love the narrative about Flower being a prankster and references to this would be an added bonus.  I just want fic which shows him settling into Vegas and being happy there - he deserves it.

The Bold Type 
Jane Sloan, Ryan Decker

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

The Bold Type (Jane Sloan &amp; Ryan Decker)
I let friends and a barrage of Facebook ads talk me into starting this show and I fell in love with it, and with Jane Sloan specifically. I love that things scare her and embarrass her, but she does them anyway (and then writes something honest and heartfelt about it). I love her friendship with Kat and Sutton, so feel free to include them and any other characters from the show in your fic. I like Ryan, hence my requesting him, but the TBT really only shows him from Jane’s point of view, so I have a hard time really pinning him down. 

I really enjoy the two of them together, and would love to receive a fic that involves the two of them giving a serious, exclusive relationship a try. Jane clearly has a certain idea about what Ryan is looking for from a woman, but she hasn’t given him much of a chance to prove otherwise (nor has he put much effort into getting one). But what if he did want to date Jane seriously, and only date her? It seems like he at least entertained the idea. I’m sure there would be some missteps along the way, but I’d love to see them put in the effort. Maybe they have to go separate ways for a while, but run into each other years down the line and find that the attraction’s still there. Do they give it another go? Or do they give casual another shot, only to eventually find they want to be less casual, and then try to broach the topic again?

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Call the Midwife  (Trixie Franklin &amp; Christopher Dockerill)
I forget how I started watching this show, but I’ve watched the last few seasons over long weekends with my mother. I love the historical aspect (fashion! medical breakthroughs! the horrible trauma of a generation that survived World War II!), as well as the focus on women and all the different types of relationships that they have. It took me a season or two to warm up to Trixie, but as we’ve gotten to see more sides of her I’ve come to love the vulnerability that she hides under her perfectly applied eyeliner. I’ve been hoping she’ll get some sort of happy ending since she broke off her engagement to Tom, and I like the idea of Christopher being that for her. Neither one of them was entirely forthcoming about their pasts at the start of their relationship, but it was to avoid getting hurt (and in Christopher’s case, also to avoid his daughter getting hurt).

Please, please, please give me a happy ending (or middle) for these two. Whether it’s a sweet holiday interlude (I love the show’s Christmas episodes, but I’m also in for any other holiday), or something that has them both opening up a little more about their pasts (Trixie’s childhood and alcoholism, and Christopher’s divorce), and not letting that get in the way of their future. I’d love to see more of Trixie getting used to the idea of being in a relationship with a man who has a child. Trixie was really great with Alexandra during their first meeting, but things aren’t always that easy or pleasant when there’s a child involved. Alternately, I think there could be a lot to explore by having Christopher be formally introduced to the rest of the nuns and midwives. I love all of the canon pairings on the show, so feel free to include them, but I’d like the focus to be on Trixie and Christopher.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Emerald City  (Dorothy Gale &amp; Lucas/Roan)
Oh man, this show sucked me in from the first episode and I was so sad to hear that it was canceled. I love tv shows/books/movies that take a well-known story and twist it up, and this was no exception. At the start, Dorothy was so clearly thrown off-kilter by being sent to a world with completely different rules than her own, but she learned to play by them and play by them well. I also love how emotional she could be. When something affected her, it was clear for everyone to see.

For this fandom, I’d like to see something that picks up where the show left off. I think there’s so much to explore there, with Dorothy returning to Oz and also being around Lucas/Roan again. Something that shows them trying to figure out where they stand with each other now would be much appreciated. They were lovers and they were enemies, and they very nearly killed each other. How do they reconcile that? Is he Lucas or is Roan or is he some combination of both of them now? Where are his loyalties now? Can they trust each other? So much of their relationship is completely up in the air and can go down so many different paths. It’s exciting to think about. I also really loved both of their relationships with Sylvie, so feel free to include her.

Orphan Island - Laurel Snyder (Abigail)
I am a children’s librarian and I read this book for a committee I’m on at work. I wouldn’t say that I like the way it was open ended and mysterious, but I loved the book and the unanswered questions have definitely been circling around in my head since I finished. I will give Laurel Snyder a lot of credit, because usually books like this annoy me rather than intrigue me.

So I’d love to have your take any of the many unanswered questions. Who was Abigail, where was she from, and what happened to her? How did the first children end up on the Island? Where to the children start out from before coming to the Island, and where do they end up afterwards? Is there a purpose to the Island? How does the Island manage to provide the children with everything they need (at least until it’s rules are broke, and then how does it know the rules have been broken)? I know I requested Abigail, but if you’d like to focus on any other character or just give me worldbuilding, you do not need to include her.

Provost's Dog - Tamora Pierce 
Sabine of Macayhill (Provost's Dog)

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Provost’s Dog - Tamora Pierce (Sabine)
I’ve been reading Tamora Pierce’s books since I was a kid, and about two years ago I did a re-read of everything she’s written. I wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the Provost’s Dog trilogy when it originally came out, but the second time around I got so much out of it. As an adult, I loved seeing the Tortall of the past, as well as all these events/trends/movements/etc that created the Tortall we see in Pierce’s other books.

Sabine in particular is a great example of this. We tend to think that as time moves forward society gets more progressive, but Sabine is a lady knight in a society that is becoming more narrow in its gender roles. It would be fantastic to receive something that explores that more. How does the Cult of Gentle Mother affect her life as a knight, or even her life farther down the line when she’s put down her sword? How does it affect women knights as a whole? Alternately, something that shows Sabine processing/recovering from Tunstall’s betrayal and coming to terms with the inequality he saw in their relationship would be wonderful, as would something showing her relationships with Bekah and/or Clary in the wake of this.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Wayward Children series - Seanan McGuire (any)
Oh man, I was in love with this series from the moment I first read a description. And then I was completely awed by Seanan McGuire’s handling of it, especially in regards to the worlds she created for these children to have spent time in. I found every character in this tagset so interesting, and they each have so much about them to be explored, so whoever it was that you offered and whoever it is that you ended up writing about, I’m sure I’ll love it. I’m not really interested in anything shippy with regards to this series (I don’t think I really have ships for this series), so feel free to have any characters interacting in any way. Also, this is my first time requesting ‘any’ in an exchange, so I’m sorry if I’m explaining things I shouldn’t or not explaining things that I should.

Some ideas: We’ve seen/heard in first person what Nancy and the twins’ worlds were like, so I’d love to see or hear more about where Loriel, Christopher, Eleanor, and Kade went. That could be done set in their first trips to those worlds, or because one of them finds a portal back, or whatever interests you. I’d also love to see an alternate universe in which Loriel does make it back to her world. We know the Spider Queen mourned her for a long time; what was their relationship like? What happens to Jack, Jill, and/or Nancy now that they’re back in the worlds they longed for? Is it different now that things are permanent, now that they have a more concrete understanding of where they are and how they got there and where they were from?

Hello author! I'm out of the country without good internet access until Oct 23rd, so I will probably not be able to get a proper author's letter up until then (sorry!!). However, I've requested RW in previous Yuletides and nothing in those letters will change significantly (including dnws), so if you want to start working off those it's perfectly fine by me!

Mary mother of Jesus had a hard life to live. Tell me about that. Tell me about her relationships with her son and with the women (including the song's narrator) who supported her.

Alternately: \"slivers of the goddess that they never let us see\" is the line that most strikes me in this song. In a polytheistic world, where apotheosis is not unheard of (and may well be how Mary's mortal son got to be a god in the first place), who was Mary, and who did she become?

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Erasmus (Captive Prince), Torveld (Captive Prince)

The Captive Prince series is freaking amazing. So many feels! Erasmus should get all the hugs and comfort he wants; he seriously deserves to be happy, and Torveld is the kind of master who would treat him well and actually care. Erasmus and Torveld were just so sweet together when they showed up, even if we didn't get to see enough of them in canon. How are they going to feel about what happened in Kings Rising when they find out about everything? How will post-canon political changes affect their relationship? Missing (sexy, if you’re into that) scenes from during the canon timeline would be cool, too. :) Please no Erasmus/Kallias except as something that happened in the past.

I’d be happy if Damen and Laurent showed up in disguise somehow, if that’s something you wanted to do and it made any sense at all with the plot. An exception to my crossdressing DNW is crossdressing disguises, which are fun and also canon here. Charls showing up would also be welcome if you’re into that. Speaking of fun canon things, anything with Erasmus' musical talent would be great, too. I bet Torveld would be totally into it if Erasmus wrote him a song. ^_^

Shades of Magic - V. E. Schwab 
Holland Vosijk, Kell Maresh

The world!! Actually, the world<i>s</i>. I love the worldbuilding and magic in this series. I want more of it! There’s so much to explore when you have four Londons: this series has dimension-hopping <i>and</i> people with enough angst to fill multiple universes. Both the characters and the universe(s) themselves are just super-compelling. I so haven’t seen enough of Kell or Holland yet, and I definitely haven’t seen enough of them interacting. I ship those two a lot. They have a fascinating dynamic where they’re antagonistic and have completely different viewpoints but can’t help relating to each other on some level because they’re the last <i>Antari</i> left. Also fascinating is the potential to (mis)use <i>Antari</i> magic for sexy purposes. (It’s a very “your mileage may vary” kink, but I’d totally be into magic-enabled bloodplay here.) 

Being <i>Antari</i> seems to mean being a complete mess, psychologically. With great power comes great angst! Especially with <i>A Conjuring of Light</i>. It was awesome getting to see Holland and Kell working together, but that ending was so sad! I would be more than happy if you came up with an alternate ending where neither of them was damaged by that Inheritor (I knew it was going to be bad when it showed up!) and Holland doesn’t die. Please no Kell/Lila, and I’d prefer Lila not show up.

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Hiraga Josef Kou, Lauren Di Luca, Roberto Nicholas

I’m not even sure how to describe the show, but Scooby Doo: Vatican Edition is one alternate title I saw, and it’s totally appropriate. It could also be called WTF Vatican: The Show. It’s total cracky fun. So many wild plot twists of the “did that actually happen? Yes, it did,” variety. I don’t know how sensible the IT dungeon is (yes there’s what can only be described as the Vatican IT Dungeon), but it’s sure fun. Amidst all the crack and WTF plots, there’s a lot of heartfelt feelings, too. Heartfelt feelings and more cocaine than you might expect for a show about priests (who are basically married or want to be, in my eyes - Lauren is <i>so</i> very jealous of Roberto and Hiraga).

I just love the way Hiraga and Roberto work together and bounce off each other and obviously care about each other. I also love the idea of Lauren’s frustrated, bitter crush on Hiraga. And Lauren’s interactions with Roberto. Casefic would be awesome, and so would anything hurt/comfort. There’s so much potential for feelings between Roberto and Hiraga and also physical danger that causes or reveals feelings. (Sex pollen would be an excellent reason for hurt/comfort.) Speaking of feelings, I’m into the ideas where everyone assume Hiraga and Roberto are in a relationship and Hiraga is completely oblivious.

Luke Snyder

I'm a super cliche shipper of Luke/Reid. I love the pairing and I still resent the way the show ended. That being said,&nbsp; I would love a 'Train? What train?' story, or something during their (admittedly bumpy) courtship. I would also be happy with a more gen Luke-centered story. I would prefer that Luke's alcoholism not be a main focus of the story unless you have a good grasp of addiction &amp; recovery. But if you DO have those things, then incorporating Luke's recovery would be cool. I also like his relationships with his younger siblings.

Call the Midwife 

The thing I love most about this show are the relationships and the way that Nonnatus House is a source of help &amp; hope in Poplar. If you're moved to do a well researched historical look at a social issue (as the series often does), that would be cool. But honestly, I'd be just as pleased with a cheerful slice-of-life. I would be happy with a gen story, but if you choose to include a relationship, I enjoy the canon relationships of Chummy/Peter,&nbsp; Tom/Barbara, Shelagh/Patrick and Patsy/Delia. I don't especially care for Tom/Trixie (I simply didn't think they were well suited), so if your story is set during their romance, I would prefer it not be the main focus. I know that there is a lot of angst &amp; drama in the source material, but I prefer that this story be at least hopeful.

Machineries of Empire Series - Yoon Ha Lee 
Vahenz afrir dai Noum, Liozh Zai

So, this is a great fandom if you're into terrifying competent people, and Vahenz is up there on the list. Her reports are a constant source of glee: so chatty, so scattered with (possibly totally fake!) personal details -- and so full of references to her interactions with Zai. Nothing I fall for quite like a pairing of a ruthless idealist and an equally ruthless schemer. I love the idea of Vahenz seducing Zai (politically and otherwise) and somewhere along the way catching feelings, but knowing all along that if anything goes wrong she'll have to kill Zai to minimize damage and wondering whether Zai knows it, too. I also, for as little pagetime comparatively as she gets, find Zai endlessly fascinating: the deadly serious Liozh roleplaying! The actual devotion to democracy! I really want to know more about what's up with her world view, her approach to politics, etc. 

Assorted prompts: First meeting, Vahenz's first attempts to incite Zai to heresy? Vahenz giving Zai pointers on public relations? The two of them arguing about the new calendar? I can see Zai sticking at how limited their changes are, such as not being able to get rid of remembrances. How about the moment Zai decided she'd had enough? 

Generally I'm up for any Fortress of Scattered Needles interpersonal drama. If you're looking for side characters to include, I'm particularly interested in Nirai Faian and her and Iruja's experiments.

The Divine Cities Series - Robert Jackson Bennett 
Shara Komayd, Turyin Mulaghesh

So, right, funny story about me and these books: very early on in City of Stairs I made a mistake. The moment Shara met Mulaghesh, my genre senses (and/or my id?) said, Ah, the Local Authority that the Dashing Spy is working with/against, I know my spy genre, clearly here we have the Love Interest! Excellent! I was... wrong! It took me longer than I'm comfortable admitting to work out that I was wrong, and by then is was way too late for me not to ship it fervently. That exchange in Blades about Mulaghesh succeeding by being extremely obnoxious was very good for me. 

So... what I'd like is version where I'm not wrong: all the weird manipulative romance between prickly, competent women working together. Whether you go AU during Stairs, write something set between Stairs and Blades, or something set after Blades, I'll be happy. Some other favorite characters, if it helps, are Signe, Ivanya, and Olvos.

The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi 

This canon is one of the most gloriously id-satisfying things I've ever read: space opera, heists, intertextuality with the Arsène Lupin stories, a main character being dragged kicking and screaming into redemption. I finished rereading the books just before nominations closed and scrambled to pick the four best characters to facilitate an \"any\" request. What I'm after is post-canon fic: in particular, everything about Sirr's future. How do its politics shake out in this new setting? The Sobornost are obviously no longer an issue, but internal politics are still there, and there will be new opportunities for the jinn, with access to zoku tech. Use whatever combination of characters calls out to you! I have specific prompts for them in my letter. 

DNW: permanent memory loss*; plotless fluff; mundane/setting change AUs

*this is a consistent DNW but it occurs to me it's a little fraught for this fandom. What I'm against here is a story that ends in \"and then they forgot everything that happened!\" so. As long as you avoid that, it's all good.

Completely Optional Prompts: 

As far as I'm concerned, there can never be enough stories exploring the wider world of the Blade movies, particularly the Nightstalker network. How does Whistler senior go about setting it up, and how does Abby get involved?  How does Abigail and King's cell fit in with the wider Nightstalkers' network? Are they the main cell? R&amp;D? The misfits?

In one of the codas at the end of the movie, seen in the extended version, the vampires have been wiped out by DayStar and Abby and King are now hunting werewolves with Caulder, with the suggestion that the werewolves they're hunting have somehow been vampirised.  Tell me about that, whether it's how they move into werewolf hunting, or about one hunt in particular.

What happens when a hunt goes wrong? What if Abby's hurt? Or King?

Do they ever have to go undercover to find their mark? Troll night clubs looking for vampire lairs? Haunt metro networks or street corners?

Do they ever take the night off? What does downtime look like to a vampire hunter?

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story).

Completely Optional Prompts: 

It looks like we won't be getting any more Emerald City (sad face) so I'm all about fic that picks up where the series left off. 

What happens when Lucas comes for Dorothy? Does she go back to Oz with him? Does she not?  Do they face the Beast Forever and defeat it, save her mother?

What about Lucas's relationship with Glinda? Is he still torn between being Roan and being Lucas?  Why did Jane send him, or did she? Is it a trap?

Or, how did Lucas make the decisions he did that led to him trying to kill Dorothy? Was it simply the power that Glinda exerts, or something deeper that that? Something of Roan?

What about Dorothy? Was it grief or rage or something else that had her literally putting Lucas back where she found him?

How do they move past it? Do they? Or does it get buried under the weight of things they have to go, a silent tension between them while they do what needs to be done?

What about Toto? Does he make go back to Oz, too?

Other things you might want to know: I have read all of the Oz books, but that was many, many moons ago when I was wee.

I love how Button tries so hard to live up to their expectations of him, how he's itching to do more, but how he's still a child in many ways - trusting and impatient both at once. I love Charley's big brother like exasperation, and Boss's barely hidden affection, as rough and ready as the man himself. And how eager Button is for that praise, the need for validation.

Just anything about this little family - before the movie or after it - would be great.

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> The only reason I haven't also selected Sue is because I don't want to limit you to a post-movie fic. But if you want to include her, I'd be really happy with that. And if you do want to set it pre-movie, feel free to include Mose. 

No slash or underage sex for this fandom, please. Thank you.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story). No death fic, although I'm okay with a story dealing with the aftermath if it happened in canon.

Sólo quiero caminar | Just Walking (2008) 
Aurora Rodriguez, Gabriel (Sólo quiero caminar)

Please see my letter for information on why I love this fandom in particular, and wider info on my likes and dislikes.  I ship my chosen characters, but it's okay if you don't :)

Completely Optional Prompts: 

Can I just say one thing - why the hell does no one in this movie ever think to call a bloody ambulance? I mean, I get the aesthetic, but frankly if you've got time for a dramatically slow death scene, full of conversations with loved ones, then you've got time to call an ambulance.

So let's call one, yeah?  

So what I want is fix-it fic. No one dies. They escape. They carry out more crimes. They're avenging angels for the abused women and children of the world. Gloria sees her kid grow up and Paloma isn't forced into that weird thing of raising a teenager who's got a crush on each other.  Gabriel and Aurora actually learn about each other. Maybe they're all on the run from the mob. Maybe they aren't. Where do they go from here?

That's really what I want, but feel free to elaborate however you like on that bare-bones request :D

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> I'm perfectly happy if you want to include the whole gang. I'm just thoroughly intrigued by Aurora and Gabriel (and those smoking hot scenes) between them, so I'd like any story to focus on them, please.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves.

Blue Plate Special - Jeff Lee Johnson 

For this prompt: I'm pretty open to anything.  You don't have to stick to the nominated characters, you can crossover, you can do meta worldbuilding.  Pic something in the picture and tell me a story about it.  

This will be an exception to some of my general notes below in that tentacle sex is always a good thing if that's what you're about too.  Just throwing that into the mix.  You're not obligated and I'm not expecting it, just saying that if the many tentacles strike your tentacle sex fancy than that's okay.

General Notes:

After a particularly difficult year where I defaulted due to stressing out over the requests of my assignment I have adopted the philosophy that Yuletide needs to be for the writer as much as the reader.  So, I firmly believe that you should write what makes you happy.  Doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to read it, but I want you to write something you'll be happy with and that won't cause you too much stress during the next few months.  

With that in mind please do take note of the following things:

I'm not looking for smut or sex or anything above a R rating (and R is probably pushing things).  My kinks are highly specific and I'm not interested in you writing for them.  I'm just not.  If the only way you'll be happy this Yuletide is to write 1000 words of smut, then you do you.  Just understand that I most likely won't read it, but I'm giving you permission to do that.

I enjoy most every fandom trope out there, but the ones that mess with consent (AMTDI, Sex Pollen, etc).  Certain ones I'm not overly fond of (A/B/O, wing!fic, people-as-pets, things along these lines) but will enjoy an interesting deconstruction of the trope or twist on it.

Beyond that write what makes you happy.  And feel free to have the mods contact me about anything you have questions on.

Maybe they're just hanging out at the Last Dance drinking milkshakes.

If you read the Incryptid Series as well feel free to explore their relationship with each other in relation to their connections to the Price family.  I think it's interesting that they're both Price family ghosts, but they didn't interact for like 40 years.  How'd that work?

Pyre (Video Game) 
Jodariel (Pyre), The Reader (Pyre), Pamitha Theyn, The Moon-Touched Girl (Pyre)

I’d love a story that takes these characters and explores the world through them - especially the Rites. How does it feel to be in a Rite? What relationship do they have to the Reader? Or you could write about the revolution, and the Commonwealth, and how these people change the world &lt;3 Feel free to pick any mix of liberated people - whatever suits the story. I don’t have one particular solid headcanon for this game; part of what I like about it is that it feels like there are good things and bad things for any given ending for any given character.

Jodariel is the best, and I ship her like crazy with everyone. Her design is super appealing to me for one thing, with her buff arms and her horns and the way she moves in the Rites, both hulking and graceful. I love her mixture of kindness and reserve and frosty defensiveness - you can see how her history has shaped her, made her afraid and defensive, but also how incredibly kind she is. I’m up for any kind of story about her life in the Downside, but especially stories that focus on her place in the Nightwings, and how she feels about the other characters (I started to write out notes about individual relationships, realised how long it would be, and gave up. But I love all of them). Or how her life changes if she’s Liberated.

Pamitha is incredible. She’s beautiful, she’s snarky, she can fly. What’s not to love??? I really love her story with her sister, and how she begs you to lose the liberation rite against the Essence. A story about her and Tabitha would be incredible - whether they’re both liberated, only one of them is, or they both stay Downside.

The Moon-Touched Girl is great. I really like the way in which she’s odd - her perspective on reality might not be the same as other people, but it has its own internal logic. And she can be very sharp and intuitive. Her backstory hints at sadness, but it’s not the point of her character - her story is as much about her present and future as the experiences that led her to the Nightwings. I love her interactions with basically everyone - a fic about how she sees the other characters would be fantastic. Or a story about her experiences after the end of the game, especially if she is chosen in the Liberation Rite. (I called her Mae, as a nod to Night in the Woods, but give her whatever name you like for her.)

Given how much choice you have about the Reader, there’s a lot of different options. The only thing that I ask is that you make the Reader female - since I prefer my reader ships f/f. Otherwise, you can use whatever backstory you prefer. I chose the crippled scholar, and I do like the implications of the Reader being physically disadvantaged - the way that plays into their role in the Rites. But use whatever suits your feelings and story. As for story prompts: honestly, I think I’m mostly interested in fic about the Reader’s in story feelings. How do they feel about the role they were thrust into? How do they make their decisions about who to choose for Liberation? Or post-game fic about the consequences of their choices would also be fascinating.

&nbsp;

Ship-wise, I adore Jodariel/Pamitha, as a fabulous enemies-to-lovers ship (and this is one that I would be totally up for porn with - between Jodariel’s horns and Pamitha’s wings there is some really good potential, plus I could see them having a lot of fun with bondage - though who’s tying up who is a serious question). I’d love stories that tackle how they might get together, whether it’s slow burn, or a physical relationship that awkwardly dredges up feelings. (If you’re writing slow burn, don’t feel obliged to include the whole relationship. A short fic that was entirely stumbling blushes and awkward touches and the promise of something more down the line would be incredible.)

I also really like Jodariel/Moon-Touched Girl. It’s protrayed more as a familial relationship in canon, but I could easily see it becoming romantic. Though I imagine the Moon-Touched Girl would have to initiate things (and in fic with age differences, I do usually prefer the younger person to take the lead).

Jodariel/Reader is also great - partly because I am weak and Jodariel is hot, and partially because I think she’s the one of the companions who takes the most work. Getting her to open up and trust you is tricky, and I always like a puzzle that’s hard to solve. I particularly enjoy this ship as one where Jodariel is much taller and stronger than the Reader, because I am shallow.

Since I’m requesting the Reader, I’ll mention that I also really like Reader/Sandra. Obviously, Sandra wasn’t nominated, so this is very, very optional, but I did find their relationship fascinating. The tensions that exist in a situation where the Reader has all the power, Sandra’s loneliness and sarcasm and longing for companionship, the complications of not being able to touch - it is all such good stuff.

響け! ユーフォニアム | Hibike! Euphonium (Anime) 
Kousaka Reina, Oumae Kumiko

I got an absolutely wonderful gift for this fandom two years ago, but that was before season two came out, and I am weak and I want more. As much as I loved season two’s focus on family and sisterly relationships, I was a bit gutted that we didn’t get more of Reina and Kumiko. (That said, I really liked that Taki-sensei firmly rejected Reina. It was one of his best moments as a teacher, and I was so happy to see that subplot over and done with.)

I love both Reina and Kumiko separately, for different reasons. I love Reina for her overwhelming drive to succeed, and her passion, and how proud she is of her own talent. And I love Kumiko for her bluntness, and nosiness, and how she pays attention to people. And I love that she loves music, even though it takes her a bit longer to realise it. Fics that are about music - about how either or both of them relate to music, and about how it shapes and guides them through their lives would be amazing. I like to think that music is important to them for the rest of their lives.

If you’re writing shippy fic (and I ship the heck out of these two), I’d love a fic about them in college, or even later in their life. I like to imagine them both as professional musicians, eventually, and it would be really interesting to read a fic about how that plays into a romantic relationship between them. Something about them figuring out their feelings would be great - especially if there’s mutual pining. Or something about them in an established relationship, and how they juggle work and time commitments and all those other things. Reina is a genius, and while Kumiko has talent, she’s not quite at the same level, so that seems like something they might have to work around.

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price, Mary Crawford

I’m happy with both the Fanny/Edmund and Fanny/Henry, and if you want to include either in your story, I’ll enjoy them, but I have to confess that I would kill for a Fanny/Mary story that does what so many Fanny/Henry stories do, and breaks away from canon to write a different ending. I’m always a sucker for femslash, and the dynamic between Fanny and Mary is one that fascinates me. It has a lot of the same appeal as Fanny/Henry - that in falling for one of the Crawfords, Fanny truly changes her perspective on someone, and it pushes her away from the traditional Bertrams towards a more modern group of people. I also think it creates interesting tensions in Mary and Henry's relationship, and Fanny and Edmund's. On top of that, I actually really enjoy stories that are about starting relationships against the pressures of society and working out a way to be happy while dealing with repression. As long as they have happy endings. And I would ask, if you write this, that you give them a happy ending. I don't need them to be universally accepted by everyone around them, out and proud, but I would like them to be happy with each other.

* One thing that would be very interesting is to see Mary and Fanny in a completely different setting: perhaps in Mary’s London circle. I don’t think Fanny would be at all comfortable, that’s what would be so interesting.

Fanny is a great character. She’s extremely insecure, but in an incredibly relatable way, and despite her insecurity she has a will of absolute iron. She’s got a lot of insight into people, but she can also be very blind, especially as it concerns herself. And all of this is bound up in her morality. Fanny is an extremely ethical person, though her standards of ethics and morality don’t totally align with a modern perspective. I think her consistent desire to do what is right, rather than what is easy, is part of what makes her such a great character, but she doesn’t always consider other people’s perspectives, and it would be cool to see a fic that challenge some of her presumptions of the world.
* I’d love a fic where Fanny is, for whatever reason, trapped in a room making conversation with someone she would normally never talk to. Again, that idea of pushing at her boundaries a little, and exploring what her limits are, but also maybe giving her a chance to reconsider an assumption, really appeals to me. The person she’s talking to could be someone like the Admiral, Mary and Henry’s uncle, or one of Mary’s friends, or even one of the Admiral’s mistresses.
Fanny’s refusal of Mr. Crawford is one of my favourite parts of the book, even though I like fic where they do get married. That enduring and tenacious refusal is such a powerful plot point. I’d love to see fic about other times in her life when she had to draw on that stubbornness. (If you wanted to make this a ‘five times’ fic you totally could - I’m always a fan of those, but just one time would be equally interesting.)

Mary fascinates me because of the many ways in which she serves as a foil to Fanny. They’re great mirror images of each other. She’s superficially much more decisive and strong-willed than Fanny, but underneath she’s actually much more reliant on what other people think of her. In an odd way, she’s also very insecure. She really needs to be liked by other people, I think, really wants the approval of those around her. Whereas Fanny, though she feels that she doesn’t really deserve love and affection, is very good at relying on her own inner resources.
* A fic about Mary’s past, and her childhood, would be delightful. It’s only touched on very briefly in the story, but she must have had an extremely challenging childhood, between the deaths of her parents and being raised in a house with an aunt she loved and an uncle she hated. There’s a line in the book where Fanny says that Mary shouldn’t speak ill of her uncle, even though he’s not a good person, and while it’s completely true by the mores of Jane Austen’s time, I kind of love Mary for refusing to bow to those standards and pretend that her uncle is a good person when he pretty clearly isn’t.
* There’s a comparison that’s often made between Austen and Mary Crawford - that although Mary is the antagonist, she’s a lot more similar to Austen than Fanny is. I don’t entirely know how fair that is, but it did give me the idea of Mary becoming a writer like her creator, and I think that could make for a great fic. Maybe, years later, she writes about a fictionalised version of the events of Mansfield Park? It would be really interesting to see how she might revisit that story in later years, and what, if anything, she would change.

Little Witch Academia 
Atsuko \"Akko\" Kagari, Diana Cavendish

It actually took me a while to sit down and watch this anime, but I loved it to pieces when I did. It’s so creative and fun and exciting, and the characters are just so likeable.

Akko is great. One thing I really like about her is that although she can be kind of lazy and flaky and impatient, we actually see her putting in the work. She really fights for her skills, and I love every moment when her earnestness and hard-work and determination shine through. She’s so sincere and sweet. I’d love a story about her learning magic, and improving. The magic in the series is so fun and creative, and I really like the world, so just Akko studying could make for a brilliant fic.

Diana is interesting - I like her in the series a lot more than in the original OVA. I love her kindness, and her determination to do the right thing, and the walls she puts up to hide her generosity and compassion. She’s genuinely a really good person, underneath the arrogance and standoffishness. I’d be particularly interested in stories about her relationship to her family, and how she feels about her heritage. Or stories about her in the ‘normal’ world, where she can’t use her magic and has to rely on her other skills.

And of course, I adore Diana/Akko as a ship. Getting together fic would be great, or fic about them working out exactly what it is they feel for each other. The series has a lot of tropey fun with things like the love bee, and I would love a fic where maybe some magical mishaps forces them to confront feelings they might not otherwise acknowledge. I think Akko and Diana are two people who are really good for each other, and they push and challenge each other in ways that make them both better people - which I guess is the ideal.

British Government Cats RPF 
Palmerston (British Government Cats RPF)

I admit it: in the Larry vs. Palmerston feud, I am a Palmerston partisan. That doesn't mean I'm not interested in the other cats, but I'd like him to be the star of the show. Does Palmerston ever get his medal (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/768462331508625408)? Meet his tigers (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/808723549309517825)? Why does Treasury keep Gladstone,
as the Telegraph once put it, \"under lock and key,\" and can Palmerston befriend his colleague anyway? What was Freya straying in search of, and can Palmerston piece together the clues left in her absence? And what's the root of his feud with Larry, anyway?

In general, I am more interested in a story from the perspective of the cats than one from a human perspective. I would prefer no cat death (though brief references to off-screen death of OCs are fine if, e.g., you want to write some sort of mystery, as are mentions of predecessors dying from old age or similar).

If inspiration strikes you, I would love a fusion or crossover with another Yuletide-sized fandom here. Diane Duane's Cats of Grand Central series comes to mind as one obvious choice; seeing Palmerston somehow embroiled in Falcon business in a Rivers of London crossover could also be cool.

I'm also happy with something cracky. An AU where Sir Simon McDonald turns into a cat and has to be taught feline ways by Palmerston? Yes please. (I'd prefer no AUs where cats turn into humans, though.) Palmerston is appointed Ambassador to [Country] and everyone treats this as perfectly normal? Sign me up. Post-apocalyptic cat road trip? I'm on board.

Slip Slidin' Away - Paul Simon (Song) 
The Woman Who Became A Wife, The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown, The Father Who Had A Son, Delores (Slip Slidin' Away)

I am fond of songfic that takes lyrical metaphors excessively literally. Why is The Man Who Wears His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown in danger of disappearing? What's The Woman Who Became A Wife's objection to rain? What's making the road they travel so difficult to glide down? How is God involved in the whole mess? But if you'd rather be more subtle and illusive, that's cool too. 

Fantasy, science fictional, and dystopic settings are my jam. Maybe they're all time-travelers, working together to wander the twisty roads of alternate timelines and try to fix their society's their future, but always finding the result not quite as planned? (Maybe Delores lives in the past, and The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown's love jeopardizes their mission.) Maybe they've successfully defeated the Evil Overlord and are finding that bringing their kingdom back to peacetime (and finding their own happiness within it) is more complicated than anticipated. Maybe they're space travelers voyaging between unstable wormholes. 

If you're not into speculative fiction, I'm also a fan of historical/period pieces. Pick a time and place that speaks to you, and show me how these people struggle to balance their hopes and regrets. Whatever route you go, I don't expect all the characters to have equal prominence, but I would like to see the different verses connected into a single story somehow.

Tuya is Maika's best friend; she's also Maika's betrayer, and as of Volume 2 we have no idea why. I'm interested in speculation about what's going on in her head and what she's experienced since splitting up from Maika (complicated Dusk Court politics would definitely be my jam), but I'm equally intrigued by their backstory in the camps and with the Scyth. I ship the two of them, but that doesn't mean I expect them to find a happy ending--happy-for-now shippy backstory with foreshadowing to what lies ahead would be great, and I'd also be interested in something unrequited (from either side). 

If you want to include other characters, Kippa is one of my favorites, and I'm curious what she and Tuya would have to say to one another if they ever met. I'm also fascinated by Maika's relationship with her mother; what's Tuya's take on it? What was Tuya's own relationship with her parents?

Cannibalism, murder, torture, vivisection, and general mayhem on level with canon are fine, but please no rape.

Stranger Things (TV 2016) 
Nancy Wheeler, Barbara \"Barb\" Holland

This is a desperate plea for fix-it fic: I like everything about this show except for the disparity between how Barb and Will's disappearances were handled. Will's disappearance gets to be the focus of the show; Barb's, well, no one except Nancy seems to care that she's gone at all. But I care. So: show me Nancy interacting with other people who care that Barb is gone. Or give me Nancy and Barb backstory that develops Barb's character and their friendship. Or, if you're up for it, give me an AU where Barb is rescued, instead of or in addition to Will. How does her time in the Upside Down change her? How does Nancy help her re-integrate on her return? What do their lives look like, ten or twenty years later? Or what about an AU where she's never taken--maybe one where Hawkins National Laboratory rescues her, and she ends up working for/with them?

I am happy to read Nancy and Barb as platonic friends or (if they both live) as a femslash pairing. I do find the canonical pairings interesting, but they're teenagers and prone to being fickle in love; if you want to break Nancy and Steve up, that's fine with me. I also enjoy poly fic in this fandom.

Third Crusade RPF 
Richard I of England (Third Crusade), Philip II of France (Third Crusade)

Yes, yes, yes, I know, maybe it was just a political thing, Richard and Philip sleeping in the same bed. I don’t care. I want it not to be. I want all the stories where Richard and Philip fell as powerfully in lust and/or in love as Eleanor and Henry before them. Richard was widely known as being extremely attractive – 6’5”, powerful, reddish-gold hair, dynamic and decisive. I know less about Philip’s canonical looks, but I do love <a href=\"https://s25.postimg.org/whtq0xaun/amiel_portrait.jpg\">this 19th century portrait of him</a>, whether or not it’s accurate. 

Any of my general likes that fit this situation would be excellent here! (See my letter for general likes/prompts.) How does their relationship begin? When does Richard go from ‘enemy of my dad is my friend, let’s go talk to Phil and see if he’ll help’ to ‘shit, Phil grew UP’? Did Philip initially only intend to make his friendship with Richard tighter, and then once they’re in bed together for the grand Photo-Op of Friendship for the benefit of the court (and to disturb Richard’s father), realise that he’s got himself into bed with a tall drink of water? Do they joke about the complicated political situation in between stealing kisses in the garden? Is Richard the first guy Philip’s been with? Does either give the other symbolic jewelry/other presents? Does Richard joke about wanting to marry Philip instead of Philip’s half-sister Alys? 

Anything set during the period from 1187-1189, while Richard &amp; Philip were allied against Henry, would be amazing. I feel like this would be the happiest time for them, before Henry died and Richard became king, putting his relationship with Philip on an uneasier footing (given the power dynamics at play between France and England) and eventually leading to open conflict. All the happy falling-in-love, scheming-against-one’s-father, two ruthless young men falling in lust and love, as you can manage. :D

But this isn’t the only possible time period, of course! After Richard became King, he went on the Third Crusade with Philip and others, determined to rescue Jerusalem from Saladin. This could also be a very fruitful setting for fic. I think it’s really interesting that one of the reasons both Richard and Philip went on Crusade at the same time was that they were afraid that if one of them stayed behind he’d take advantage of the other’s absence to go after his land! It’s hard to be friends/lovers when you’re rival monarchs. :( If you’re writing shipfic during this time, I’d prefer a bittersweet tone that remembered good times of the past over a darker angst one, though there’s certainly angst to be had aplenty as Richard and Philip’s relationship unravels over the course of the Crusade. 

Feel free to use as much or as little of the politics of the Third Crusade as you like. I love history, and I love historical detail, so if you’re a gen writer and you want to write complicated-friendship fic about how Richard and Philip quarrelled over Cyprus, go for it. On the other hand, if you want to write a mostly-history-free story about Richard and Philip’s last night together before Philip leaves the Crusade and goes back to France, I’d love that too! 

I would also love a fic set in an AU where men marrying each other is totally normal (though rare among royalty because of the need for heirs), and Richard and Philip fall in love and decide to get married and combine their kingdoms (much to Henry and Eleanor’s probable dismay). It would work out heir-wise because Philip’s son Louis was born in 1187 and his wife Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, so he’d have been a widower free to marry for love at that point. (Or you could delete Philip’s marriage entirely, though in that case I’m not sure what they would have done for an heir. Mpreg? Adoption being a legitimate way to acquire royal heirs?) I would be equally pleased with this scenario being taken seriously or being treated more tongue-in-cheek (with comical reactions from Henry, Eleanor, John, etc.)

Wars of the Roses RPF 
Margaret Beaufort (Wars of the Roses), Margaret of Anjou (Wars of the Roses)

I really love these characters. Both of them had a huge number of trials in their lives, and they fought on anyway. (For more on my thoughts about them, see my letter - I have no room here.)

A general prompt for both of them: In the middle of all their political moves, they unexpectedly fall in love with one of their friends/ladies-in-waiting/enemies. They realise they’ve never actually been in love before (not surprising, given the political nature of their marriages), and this new development is both thrilling and scary. (I love snatched moments of happiness, even while the world is burning around you. I have no problem with infidelity if it's a f/f relationship that's ‘cheating’ on arranged/coerced marriages.)

For this fandom, feel free to treat it as \"or\" matching rather than \"and\". Although if you want to put both Margarets in the same fic, I'd be up for that too!


  <b>Margaret of Anjou</b>


Apart from Margaret-bashing stories and heartbreaking deathfic (aka when Edward dies at Tewkesbury), I’m open to pretty much anything. Some ideas:

•	When did Margaret first realise the scope of the task that loomed before her – protecting Edward’s inheritance until he was old enough to protect it himself? Did she quail at first? How did she learn to be ruthless?
•	Margaret and Edward’s relationship over the years, as she reared him to be the King his father had never been able to be. Did she worry that his father’s instability would be passed down to him? How did she feel when he started reaching maturity? When he married Anne Neville?
•	Margaret during Edward IV’s first reign, when she and her son Edward had fled to France and were making allies and building support. What were her first meetings with Warwick like?
•	It’s said that Elizabeth Woodville may have been one of Margaret of Anjou’s ladies at one point. If that was so, what might Margaret have thought of Elizabeth and where she ended up?
&nbsp;
  <b>Margaret Beaufort</b>

I want to read so many stories about Margaret! Seriously, if you have an idea already, I’m probably going to be all ears. (The only exception is that I’m not into a romantic Margaret/Edmund story, since she was twelve and had no choice in the matter.)

Some ideas:
•	Margaret’s negotiations with Elizabeth Woodville - what were those two powerhouses like together?
•	Margaret persuading/manipulating/forcing her husband Lord Stanley to betray Richard III, even though Stanley was risking the life of his own son in doing so
•	Margaret’s relationship with her son Henry over the years
•	Margaret was one of Anne Neville’s close friends and ladies-in-waiting – and yet was all the time planning to betray Anne’s husband Richard III (and thus Anne). Was this difficult at all for her?
•	Margaret’s relationship with Elizabeth of York
•	Margaret saying “done with men” and swearing an oath of chastity in front of everybody and moving out on her own while still married to Stanley. How amazing must it have been to live alone without a husband for the first time she could remember? How satisfying was it to be allowed to own her own property at last?
•	I’m all for women like Margaret being able to take joy in successfully completing their life’s work. What was Margaret feeling the day her son was crowned King of England?
•	How did Margaret change over the years, from the child mother to the Queen Mother Triumphant?

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
James I of Great Britain (Stuart Dynasty RPF), George Villiers 1st Duke of Buckingham (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Yes, this is the “<a href=\"https://deafeningtimetravelgalaxy.tumblr.com/post/165928527919/nudityandnerdery-bemusedlybespectacled\">Local King Cannot Stop Promoting His Boyfriend</a>” ship. :D

Basically for this fandom I’d love to read all the happy fun fic about a king and his handsome boyfriend (Buckingham was literally called “the handsomest-bodied man in all England” by a contemporary – not James I, though he presumably thought so too), who didn’t care what anybody thought about them, were totally in love, and even built a passage linking their bedrooms together. (The better to avoid any pesky dudes-in-waiting!)

For this a lot of my general prompts would work really well (see my letter for general prompts/likes), but a few specific ones:

•	Anything about the ‘constant promotions’ thing, whether serious (James is so in love, he can’t resist giving Buckingham more and more power and influence, damn the jealousy of other nobles!) or funny (‘you’re giving me another title, James? Why not just another blowjob?’)
•	AU in which marrying a guy is fine, it’s just the fact that Buckingham is the son of a minor gentleman and not a foreign prince that causes James headaches with the rest of the nobility. (But he doesn’t care, he’s still going to marry him.)
•	I’m also a big fan of historical marriages during periods where homosexuality was illegal. Just because it wasn’t public and ‘blessed by God’ doesn’t mean that James and Buckingham pledging themselves to each other wouldn’t have meant something to them. So anything in which they have a personal/private marriage would be great.
•	A fic about the way they met! (Apparently Buckingham ‘caught James’s eye’ at a hunt when he was twenty-one.) How did he catch James’s eye? Just by being drop-dead gorgeous? Was he funny/witty as well? Did he flirt with the king?
•	Given that Buckingham stayed in power after James died, because he was friends with James’s son Charles I, how did that relationship go during James’s lifetime? Did Charles know that James and Buckingham were lovers? (Did he care?) Obviously if he did know he didn’t freak out, since he didn’t denounce Buckingham or even have him removed from power once James died. (In fact Buckingham was the only man of James’s court to keep his position under Charles.)
•	Buckingham loved to sit for portraits. Fic of James being impatient at this and flirting with him/trying to persuade him to skive off his sitting early would be great. 
•	Anything with flirting in public in a homophobic society is my jam. Did they maintain plausible deniability? Were they pretty shameless, daring the nobles to do anything about it because James was King, soooo…
•	I absolutely love James’s declaration to the Privy Council: “You may be sure that I love the Earl of Buckingham more than anyone else, and more than you who are here assembled. I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had John, and I have George.” Anything about this/set on this day/what Buckingham said when he heard about it/etc. would be great!
•	Any of your own happy/funny plotbunnies about James/Buckingham!

I'd be thrilled with a story that touches on the lives of any of the nominated characters - Miriam, Ysabeau, Marcus, or Sarah - anything at all in the story's particular world of witches, daemons, and vampires, as well as the genetic lore in the Book of Life or the historical lore behind millennia of creatures. With the new TV series in production, interest is likely to rise. If you want to explore someone's personal history (centuries of options for many characters) or dive into what they were doing while Matthew and Diana timewalked to the Elizabethan era, I'd be thrilled.

I'm really open to anything for these characters, with the exception of love triangles. I don't mind if you write Nancy/Steve or Jonathan/Nancy or whatever, but I hate love triangles.

Not into it, not here for it. That being said, their friendship is one of my most favorite things, especially their shared pasts, and that would be fun to see explored. Full disclosure, Brandt is my favorite, so if you do any kind of MI story I'd really appreciate or request you'd make him the main focus. ;) I came away from Rogue Nation specifically in love with Ilsa Faust and her story, and have kind of totally partnered her up with Brandt in my head romantically, though I'd be into seeing how her dynamics work with Ethan or anyone else on the team. And Jane, well, I've loved Jane since GP and there's NEVER enough about her. I guess what I'm saying is ALL THE TEAM FIC OR BACKGROUND FIC OR EVEN JUST A FOCUS ON ONE CHARACTER WOULD BE GREAT?

I mean look if you wanna make this queer i am Obviously HERE FOR IT, and please feel free to push that rating as far up as you can make it go. But you def dont have to! They can screw the Farmer Boy on the tractor too (together? Independently? Sequentially?)! 

I kid, I kid. I just want free form free wheeling adventure feelings, riding down the highway playing hooky with your best friend, knowing you're the shit and you can bend this world to your will, because you are young and beautiful (and in love?) and you live in a world where strip clubs have amateur night (???) and you look amazing in a suit. Capture the feeling of the wind in your hair. Tell me about that car and where they got it. What happened when they got back to school? What happened to the tractor? Maybe its ten years later and life has twisted and turned but theyre still friends. Maybe theyre not, and they meet in a supermarket (at a strip club?) and suddenly the world seems fresher and they remember that night. Maybe someone's pregnant! Go crazy! Write me the novel of how their paths led to this moment. Write me porn. It always seems you got something on your mind other than me!
But maybe lets leave actual steven tyler out of it, yes?

Royal Tenenbaums (2001) 
Eli Cash

Hello what I actually want is Eli Cash, Ritchie Tennenbaum and Margo Tennenbaum. Together? Sequentially? Yes. (see above prompt) (Lord I am ridiculous this year. All I want is threesomes and music videos, I am sorry) (In life, as it is in Yuletide).

Please tell me exactly what everyone is wearing, and what is playing on their old timey record player. Is Eli Cash ok? I bet he is. He strikes me as more resilient than the actual Tenenbaums. Does anyone who IS a Tenenbaum want to be one? What do they do in that huge old house, how do they find peace? Or, what happened w this crew BEFORE the events of the movie, how did they struggle and fall towards and away from each other? Is Eli on drugs? Does Ritchie ever play tennis again? HMM. All this distance between them and these ways they intersect with each other and have for years...do they ever find a way back to each other? What do they do about their FATHER (Royal I mean). Maybe Richie's mental illness rears its head again and the other two have to take care of him. Maybe Eli and the other two have a huge fight. Maybe Margo takes up writing again. Yeah!

\"He's taken off his shoes, and one of his socks.\"

Request 1 by AngelQueen
Enola Holmes Series - Nancy Springer 
Enola Holmes, Sherlock Holmes (Enola Holmes)

I'd love to see how Enola might be involved in the events of The Final Problem. By the end of Enola's series, her brothers had come to accept her role as a detective in her own right, and one could assume that she and Sherlock might actually cooperate on a few cases. So when Sherlock's conflict with Moriarty rears its ugly head, how might Enola play into it? Would Moriarty threaten her, maybe send a few goons after her, to shake up Sherlock? Might Sherlock try to push her away to keep her at a safe distance so she doesn't get caught in the crossfire? I doubt Enola would care for that too much.

Would Sherlock confide in her about his survival at Reichenbach, or would he and Mycroft use her grief to sell Sherlock's demise to the wider world? One thing I'd love to see would be Enola racing across Europe to Reichenbach, intent on saving her brother, only to get up to the falls at the same time as Watson and the two of them having to deal with Sherlock's supposed demise?

Feel free to include other characters like Dr. Watson, Cecily Alistair, Mycroft Holmes, Mary Morstan, etc. if you need/want to.

Bonus points for Enola and Sherlock's eventual reunion and Enola giving him what-for for using her love for him in such a way.

DNWs: non-con, scat, d/s, A/B/O

Mary Russell - Laurie R. King 
Mary Russell, Sherlock Holmes (Mary Russell - King)

I'd love to see a fic delving into the off-hand comment at the end of The Marriage of Mary Russell where Russell ropes Billy into stealing a portrait of Holmes' mother out of the family chapel to give to Holmes. Perhaps a scene where they come back from their wedding trip and the portrait has already been delivered and hung in the cottage (perhaps in the sitting room)? Romantic goodness interspersed into this is always a plus (or as romantic as Russell and Holmes get, but then they would be newlyweds at this point - hint hint).

Feel free to include any other characters that you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

What if Richard had won at Bosworth? Would he have married Elizabeth? How do they handle all those who stood against them and participated in Henry Tudor's invasion? (I'd particularly love to see them deal with Margaret Beaufort.) 

Feel free to include as many other characters as you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Princess (TV) 
Margaret Pole Countess of Salisbury (White Princess (TV))

A missing scene from the finale or a continuance of the confrontation between Margaret and Elizabeth over the executions of Richard and Teddy. Elizabeth and Henry seemed to have planned to let the two men live quietly in the Tower so as to not further the curse set upon the killers of Elizabeth's brothers, but Margaret's revealing the truth to the Spanish ambassador put paid to that plan, backing Elizabeth and Henry into a corner and forcing them to execute the two men. I'd love to see something where that knowledge is shoved into Margaret's face, proclaiming that she is just as responsible for the deaths of Richard and Teddy as Elizabeth and Henry are. I would just love to see something really highlighting how far Margaret's relationship with Elizabeth has fallen.

Feel free to include any other characters you like/need.

Request 1 by angelsunknown
Anastasia - Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally 
Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov Grand Duchess of Russia (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally)

I LOVE THIS MUSICAL SO MUCH! Like, don't get me wrong -- I'd be psyched to receive fic re: any of my nominated characters/fandoms, but. But. I LOVE THIS MUSICAL. 

I also love everyone in this bar, but I love Anya the *most*, which is why I've requested fic for her specifically. Feel free to include the other characters in your fic, though! (Also: I've seen the bootleg of the Hartford Stage production, but I'm also going to be seeing the show at the Broadhurst in December (!!!), so you could totally use either version to fuel/prop up your fic!)

(Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ What are Anya and Dmitry up to, post-musical?
+ Give me an AU where Anya takes Gleb up on his offer re: the tea shop, or where she misses Dmitry and Vlad at the Y. Palace. How does this change things for her?
+ Okay, so. I have a secret, long-shot wish for this fandom that you are totally not required to (even attempt to) fulfill, especially if you aren't into the idea, but here goes: You know how Anya wakes up (after the Ipatiev House massacre) 'by the side of a road' with these 'tracks all around' her?* WHAT IF -- WHAT IF! -- ONE OF THE OTHER GRAND DUCHESSES HAD (ALSO SURVIVED THE SHOOTING AND) LEFT HER THERE (knowing that they'd each have a better chance of making it out of Yekaterinburg alive alone)? I mean, historically-speaking, Tatiana and Maria *did* make friends with/sympathisers of some of their guards, and Olga *was* pretty shrewd ... I don't know. I'm generally not a fan of totally upending canon, but the Romanovs' story is such a sad one, and -- this canon being a mixture of fantasy and history -- you could totally make it a *bit* happier. (And, like, 2017 has been A Year. We need all the happy endings we can get, you know?) I would love, love, love to read about Anya reuniting with her ~mysterious savior~, or Anya(, Dmitry,) and the ~mysterious savior~ living happily ever after (in anonymity) together. (Note: if you choose to go down this route -- which, holy shit, means you're the bomb dot com! -- I'd appreciate it if you kept the no. of Romanov survivors at two? I wouldn't want this to get *too* far-fetched or out of hand, lmao.)

DNW: Anya attempting to reclaim her royal status/throne; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); non-con/rape; romanticising of the (Bolshevik) guards/murderers OR of Nicholas and Alexandra's reign; unrelenting angst -- I love angsty fic, but would prefer to receive something with a happy ending.

Assorted Notes: I definitely ship Anya/Dmitry; I'm always here for (unrealistic) rom-com tropes (...clearly); I'd love for your fic to be grounded in (the musical's) canon, but am also not opposed to its being bolstered by historical fact; the member of OTMA I find most interesting outside of Anastasia is probably Maria (*insert winking face emoji here*); and I am deeply, deeply sorry for all of the word vomit.

*In the HS production, I believe the last we see of the (other) Romanovs is the scene where their palace is seized by the Bolsheviks, which would make it pretty easy for you to make up your own 'this-is-how-Anya-and/or-MS-escaped' theories. I've heard the Broadway production is a little different, but ... just roll with the canon? Hand-wave away inconvenient details?

Cairo Time (2009) 
Juliette Grant, Tareq Khalifa

I watched this at the gym today -- and I really enjoyed it! It felt like a love letter to Cairo in all its dingy, dirty glory. 

I really like the characters, too -- both Juliette and Tareq felt *real* and wonderful. I know Yuletide requests operate under an 'AND' assumption, but I'd be more than OK with you only writing about Juliette OR Tareq.

Here are some (Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ Epistolary fic! In which Juliette and Tareq write each other emails (or letters; Tareq feels like more of a letter writer to me!), post-movie.
+ Fic in which Juliette revisits Cairo.
+ Fic in which Juliette sees more of the Middle East.
+ One of my favourite scenes in the movie is the one in which Juliette walks around the mosque, so, I don't know -- fic about Juliette and religion/spirituality?
+ Fic in which Tareq and Yasmeen meet up for coffee and conversation, post-movie.
+ Fic in which Tareq meets Kathryn, post-movie.
+ Fic in which you tell me about Tareq's life, post-movie.

DNW: anything (sexually) explicit; character bashing; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); infidelity; wild AUs -- I love 'canon' AUs, but hate total re-hauls.


Request 3 by angelsunknown
The View RPF 

(Totally Optional) PROMPT:

Listen. You can totally do with this fandom/request what you will, but the reason I am requesting it -- and the reason I nominated it in the first place -- is that I think it would be ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS to write out a parody/satirised episode of the show in script-form, starring satirised versions of the hosts.

Like, I don't want to read about Actual Sunny Hostin, I want to read about Sunny the Super Prude. Give me Sara being totally bland and inoffensive on purpose, Jed. (RIP Jed.-era View!) only pretending to give a fuck re: conservative issues, Joy giving no fucks re: anything, Whoopi trying to make The View Whoopi's View every five minutes. (I didn't nominate Whoopi, because I ran out of slots, but feel free to include Whoopi --  and the Uber Christians (Paula and perpetually horny Candace) -- in this if you'd like!)

For what it's worth: my actual opinions/views on various matters tend to match Joy's and Sunny's; I disagree with Jed. (and Candace!!! She is The Actual Worst) on most things; and I am mostly 'meh' about Sara's and Whoopi's (and Paula's) contributions.

DNW: fic written in the first person; the hosts' RL children/husbands/partners/situations being brought into/up in the fic.

Richard II - Shakespeare 

I am always happy with Richard II fic of any kind. Absolutely anything about this play would ROCK, seriously. This is totally my standby \"if you don't like the other prompts I will always be happy with this\" prompt. There is actually a respectable (for a tiny little fandom) number of fics out there, but at this point, I actually wrote more than a few of them, and while they say \"write the fic you want to read,\" it's nice when sometimes you don't have to. So I will be thrilled with anything you write! It can be slash or het or gen, any rating (I love smutty fics, so don't be afraid to write them, but don't sweat it if you don't like to write them), and I am willing to ship Richard with pretty much anyone who isn't his uncle or Northumberland (although Aumerle is my fave). He's like that. I am also very AU friendly (I kinda have a dream of an AU that sets the play on a Napoleonic sailing ship, but can't get around to doing the research myself, but honestly any AU setting is one I will probably dig) and I love stuff with historical backstory so if that floats your boat, feel free to write it!

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
Ben Jonson (Stuart Dynasty RPF), John Donne (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Ben Jonson and John Donne are both poets (obviously!), both really difficult, and they were both Catholic for part of their lives. They also seem to have known each other, or at least had Strong Opinions about each other's poetry. Jonson comments on Donne's poetry a few times in his non-poetic works -- I know he does it in the Conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden and I think he also does it in Timber: or Discoveries (he makes fun of him for his irregular meters and says his Anniversaries are borderline blasphemous). Anyway! You can set it when they are young and generally confused, or when they are older and crankier, I do not care! And they can Have Adventures or alternately just drink beer and gripe, whatever you like. I would love to see a conversation between these two about poetry and religion and current events and possibly beer or whatever you'd like for them to talk about. There is no need to make it slashy, because I honestly cannot picture it (Donne I think is highly slashable if he's not, you know, Dean of St. Paul's at the time the fic is set, but Jonson is another matter), but if you can, I wouldn't, like, object to it or anything!

Rome (TV 2005) 
Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005)

I’d like anything about the requested characters, individually or together. For example, what were their lives like pre-series? They didn’t spring up fully formed at the battle of Alesia, right? What did the early years of the Vorenus/Niobe marriage look like? Where did Pullo spend his childhood? How did they join the legion?
What if Vorenus never found out about Niobe’s adultery, but Caesar still died. What Changes? What stays the same?
The lost adventures/camping trips we never got to see! Sightseeing! Intrigue! Rubbing elbows with the movers and shakers! Making love under the stars!
Post-series happy futurefic, farm optional. Because I ship them like burning, and Vorenus and Pullo alive and reunited is the only ending my id will accept.

Hornblower - C. S. Forester 
William Bush (Hornblower - Forester), Horatio Hornblower (Hornblower - Forester), Barbara Wellesley (Hornblower - Forester)

Bush POV please! He's my favorite character. I love his steadfastness, loyalty and stoicism. I love Hornblower's perfect balance between trainwreck and competence. I love how they work together well despite vastly different command styles - and that they wouldn't want it any other way. And then you throw Barbara into the mix...
Poor Horatio always seems to want what he doesn't have. When he's with Barbara, he's pining for \"better than a wife\" Bush, but as soon as he's at sea he starts missing the domestic life. Really, the solution is obvious: why not both? Long live the OT3!
I'd like something post-Flying Colours and pre-Lord Hornblower (or that goes AU from it). Sheerness is really not that far from the supposed Hornblower estate. And it only makes sense to invite Bush to celebrate his new captaincy (however desk-bound) in style! And Barbara, being the astute woman she is, would notice that while Horatio is cooling his heels waiting for his next command, and Bush is valiantly struggling not to hate his post, the one thing that cheers them up is each other's company... And then Horatio comes back from the Baltic terribly sick, owing his life to Bush, who has such a hard time relinquishing the nursing duties, and he and Barbara could bond over Horatio's sickbed...
And then they all work out an arrangement and raise Richard Arthur together and there's no Caudebec, right?

I'm constantly surprised that there's not more fic for this series. It's such a fun, delightful story with great characters! And boy, oh boy, would I love a fic about these three. Like, I love Jesper/Wylan, loooove them, but I also really love the unrequited feelings Jesper had for Kaz, and I adore the friendship between Jesper and Inej, and Kaz/Inej is like one of the few het ships I have cared about recently? So basically I'd be really interested to see a story about them! Whether it's full triangle poly or, um, a V, or even if it's just gen, tbh. They're the originals, yk! I'm so curious about their backstory. Or if you want to have smth set in the future (just writing out Wylan, maybe, bc I really do love him and Jesper, and it'd make me sad to think of them breaking up, lol). Anyway, just reiterating, I love the idea of romantic feelings between the three of them (whether requited or not), but I would also really, really love gen about their friendships. More details in my letter! \o/ &lt;3

Whenever I rewatch this movie, I find myself wishing more fic for these two existed. I would in particular love a fic about the two of them falling in love after they move to New York City together. I know they would face difficulties and challenges because of the time period, but I would prefer that not to be the main focus of the fic. Please, no tragic endings or violence. I can handle angst/hurdles, but I'd prefer a happy or hopeful ending. I am generally just in love with them as characters and would be equally thrilled for great friendship fic as they spend their twenties trying to find the path that works for them (i.e., some level of deviation from the path prescribed for women of their generation).

Jupiter Ascending (2015) 
Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending), Caine Wise

This film hit so many notes on the scale of my id I cannot even. I rewatched it for letter-writing purposes and oh. my. god. I came out with a Lot of Jupiter/Caine feelings and also a Lot of feelings about Space Bureaucracy and also about praise!kink wolf fucking. I have no idea how to punctuate that latter, sorry dear writer. I'm also totally and enthusiastically on board with knotting for this pairing, but please no reference to wanting to breed someone or filling them with cum.

I would love a fic with lots of ridiculous space bureaucracy details, any exploration into tiny glimpses of the world we got in the film (what do the Skyjackers do? does Jupiter continue to have a relationship with the Aegis? does Caine get a pack again?), and I would be happy with space bureaucracy gen or something super shippy or something full of space princess/space wolf-splice sexytimes, Also while I don't want Balem resurrected, I'd be so happy for Titus and Kalique to make an appearance and I don't mind them being shipped with Jupiter (Kalique/Jupiter is my other fave just sayin'; and I'm also happy for Kalique/Titus to be the other ship if they do make an appearance) - but I don't want Jupiter/Caine to be broken up for it, or for it to happen without consent within the Jupiter/Caine ship.

Sated - Rebekah Weatherspoon 
Keira Kenney (Sated), Daniel Song (Sated)

I would love to see fic which explores more of their lives together either during or after the book. While the book itself is pretty explicit, I'd be very happy with non-explicit shippy fic exploring Keira's interest in Galaxis fandom or kickboxing, or Daniel's interest in pyrotechnics, but I would also love super porny fic too. One of the things that I found frustrating with Sated was that the initial dynamic I really liked at the beginning, where Keira topped and Daniel subbed, very quickly seemed to change by the end into Keira subbing all the time. So I would love to see more of Keira topping and getting to explore her fantasies with Daniel.

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi | Spirited Away 
Ogino Chihiro, Haku | Nigihayami Kohakunushi

This is basically one of my forever requests. I've been lucky enough to have some really amazing gifts for it already, but as this is the Ghibli film of my HEART, I am always hungry for more. This film has basically all of the things I love: protagonist leaving her everyday world for a stranger magical one, magic (a bathhouse of the gods!) alongside everyday mundaneity (CLEANING the bathhouse of the gods!) in that world, DRAGONS, coming of age themes, all the tiny magical elements of a Miyazaki film...

I would love to see future fic for this film about Chihiro as a teenager, a university student, an adult, any stage of her life really! Does she ever get to go back? What about Haku? I ship them like burning and would love to see their reunion (and perhaps courtship and eventual wedding and divine domestic bliss) but I would also be tremendously gloriously happy with genfic about Chihiro's life post-film. What does she do? What is her life like? How does the Land of Spirits bleed over into her life?

The Watchmaker of Filigree Street - Natasha Pulley 
Grace Carrow

I would really, really love future fic for Grace exploring her life after the book. Reference to Thaniel and Mori is fine, but I would prefer them not to form a significant part of the story as I feel the book already made a sufficient case for both of them. I would like Grace to get to achieve her dreams of Continuing to Study Science &amp; Conduct Strange Eldritch Experiments, but beyond that I am open to speculation: does she become Matsumoto's mistress? Does she just go as his friend and he acts as her wealthy patron? Does she make some other women friends once she's out of her usual milieu? Does she take up with an eccentric and wealthy OFC? Does she stay in Japan or does she keep travelling? Does she do her best to forget Mori or does she try to investigate the phenomenon of his abilities more closely? Does she ever see him and Thaniel again?

Shetland (TV) 
Jimmy Perez, Cassie Perez, Duncan Hunter

The relationship between Jimmy and Duncan (and by extension Cassie) is my favorite on the show. One of the things I love is that Duncan and Jimmy know each other well enough to know what hurts the other-- there's that exchange, I forget in what episode, where they fight and Jimmy acknowledges that he's a surly bastard. They don't seem to have the kind of relationship with anyone else in the show, and I love how fraught and complicated their interactions are. And I love how Cassie has different relationships with each of them, and gets different things from them, and works to establish her independence from them in different ways. Honestly, I ship the hell out of Jimmy/Duncan, but if you want to write gen that's fine too.

Whether you want to focus on the romantic and sexual aspects or the friendship is up to you -- either way, I'm here for the ride. Make it tumultuous, make it less than perfect, and I will be thoroughly satisfied. Please stick to the TV show canon; I have read the comics, but prefer this adaptation.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye, Tahani Al-Jamil

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love the universe of the Good Place and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, and I ship Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani, so if that's up your alley, feel free to write about any or all of those ships. I don't have any preference among the three, and will be super pleased with anything you produce. I'm totally fine with smut, but I don't like dubcon (and I don't think it makes a ton of sense with these characters anyway?) I also really love Jason/Janet if that's something  you're interested in including. In terms of characters I really like, I love the entirety of Team Cockroach, Vicki, and Trevor.

In terms of specific prompts or ideas, I'd love to see any of the reboots from \"Dance Dance Resolution\" that are only hinted at - any of the times the gang went to Mindy St. Clair's, the Eleanor/Tahani soulmate attempt, and the one where the whole group is spying on the clown conveyor belt for whatever reason are all some of my favorite canon reboots. I'm also super open to any reboot scenario you want to go with. I especially like the idea of using reboots to do kind of trope-heavy AU stuff - there's a fic in the tag that's a university AU that I really like. 

If Eleanor hasn't shown Chidi the tape yet by the time you're writing this or there's a different way you'd like to imagine that interaction playing out, that would be super cool. I also like the idea of a version where Eleanor says I love you to Tahani. 

Cool, mindblowing stuff is definitely going to happen on the show after I write this, so if that inspires you to do something else, definitely do it. I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) 
Rebecca Bunch, Heather Davis, Valencia Perez, Greg Serrano

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love CEG and its characters and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, but with the caveat that I think shipping fics are a bit different for CEG given that the majority of the characters are not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. I like Rebecca/Greg, Rebecca/Valencia, and Rebecca/Heather most in fics when they explicitly acknowledge that the relationship is unhealthy (R/G especially) or, even better, both people are in a better place mentally and emotionally or are getting there together. I also love Heather/Valencia and Darryl/White Josh, and am totally fine with traditional, fluffy romance for them, because they deserve it and are way more ready for that than Rebecca. I'm totally okay with smut for any of the pairings listed, but I don't want dubcon. 

Although I couldn't list them, I love Paula, Darryl, White Josh, Hector, and Father Brah and would love to any of them included if it makes sense for your story. 

In terms of non-romantic stuff, I'm obsessed with the girl gang and would love to just see a story about them scheming against Josh, or really just hanging out. I would love to see a parody/takeoff of Gone Girl with Rebecca. I'd also be interested in seeing Rebecca and Greg just interact at this point without being romantic at all - maybe Greg hears about the wedding debacle and calls her/flies back to West Covina for some reason and sees her? I'm really curious as to whether Greg actually managed to break his patterns and succeed at Emory, and I miss Greg/Rebecca interactions, so if you want to take it in that direction, I'd be down.

Since the season hasn't started yet, it's really hard to predict what cool stuff might come up, so if there's anything that happens in s3 that you really want to write about, go for it! I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Groundhog Day - Minchin/Rubin 
Phil Connors (Groundhog Day Musical), Rita Hanson (Groundhog Day Musical)

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love this show  and will be into whatever you produce.

I ship Phil/Rita, and I like romantic fics, so if you're into that kind of thing, definitely go for it! I really  like AUs - some AU ideas I'm into are ones where the loop ends at a different time, Rita and Phil are both in the loop, completely different AUs like the college AU in the tag. I also like the idea of deleted scenes from within the loop - how did Phil interact with Rita during the time between If I Had My Time Again and Seeing You, when he was trying to help out the town? Did he ever tell Rita about the loop after the one day we see? Future fics are also great, especially ones where Phil has to figure out how to tell Rita about the loop or is kind of angsty about how much he already loves her when she really doesn't know him. 

If you're not into Phil/Rita or romance, I really love any stories you might have about life for Phil during or after the loop. I like fun stories during the Philandering time period where Phil gets up to some crazy stuff, stories about Phil going back to Punx at some point and what that would be like, or just whatever you can think of. In terms of Rita-centric fic, I'd love to see a fic from her pov at any point in the loop, especially the day Phil tells her about the loop, or literally anything about her background/family. I like the idea that Rita and Phil become best friends even if they're not romantic.

These are all just some ideas if you're looking for inspiration - I will love whatever you write! Thanks for indulging me, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Killjoys (TV) 

General likes: gen, friendships, found families, team as family, plot, character studies, humor, angst, banter, competence, magic, mythology, crossovers (as long as I’m familiar with the other fandom). I’m okay with relationships, but I’d prefer if they weren’t the main focus of the story.

General dislikes: explicit sex, rape/non con, A/B/O, mundane AU’s (i.e. coffee shop, high school), major character death (unless it’s canon, but even then I’m often in denial). Also, I’d rather not get a Christmas-themed fic.

There are so many things I love about this show, including the world building, the themes of found family and identity and recovery, and Turin’s hair. Team Awesome Force is a delight, as are all of the secondary characters (Fancy’s arc in season 3 was incredible).

One thing: I do feel strongly that David’s mental illness was not caused solely by his powers or by the presence of the Shadow King in his mind, so if you’re going to write a post-season 1 fic featuring him, I’d appreciate it if his schizophrenia wasn’t magically cured.

The Prestige (2006) 
Alfred Borden, Robert Angier

DNWs: Incest, Suicide, Rape/Noncon

Things I love about this canon: obsession, corruption, the mechanics of a magic trick, schemes of revenge, the flirtation with science and magic (via Tesla), and Twin Christian Bales (who have distinct personalities that shine through to the point where you can guess which is which when they’re on screen!) 

Ships: Canon ships only, please!

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

Two very different people with wildly varying moral truths investigating paranormal activities! Ruminations over journalism ethics and also the apocalypse! Sign me up!

I've always adored supernatural stories/investigation and Monster-of-the-Week type stories. Especially when they involve a straight-laced skeptic possibly finding out that he's got psychic powers and a lady journalist who dealing with how far she can (or will) go to find the truth at the bottom of whatever conspiracy.  I also cannot stress enough how much I'm a sucker for straight-laced, buttoned-up characters and pushing them to their breaking point. I don't think we've fully gotten to that point with Richard Strand...but how would we get there?

Daybreakers (2009) 
Edward Dalton

Ohh, this movie. The cold city noir/sun-soaked country aesthetic is like catnip to me.

I love ridiculously moody science fiction thinkpieces and this is...nearly there. Vampirism is a metaphor for our dependence on fossil fuels! Sam Neill is the literal bloodsucking embodiment of corporate greed! Ethan Hawke is conflicted and just wants to change the system, but HE IS THE SYSTEM! Fedoras are back in style! 

For what could have been just a gushy/gory vampire film, there's actually a lot of thoughtful worldbuilding that I would just love to see explored. A lot of little tidbits that were barely hinted at: the outbreak starting with a bat bite, what's happening globally/in third-world countries, the fact that forest fires are a major problem because starving vampires are going out hunting and then accidentally getting barbecued when they don't get out of the sun in time....

Iron Fist (TV) 
Ward Meachum (Iron Fist (TV)), Jeri Hogarth (Iron Fist (TV))

I'd really love to see Ward and Jeri interact more (no romantic relationships though, please). She's officially Rand's legal counsel now, right? And with the bonds of attorney/client privilege and what she already knows, she's probably one of the few people Ward would be able to talk to about the events of the series and (possibly) what happens after. So, please. Give me Ward trying to talk to literally the only person he can (since Joy's possibly hard to reach and Danny's off in K'un-Lun) while Jeri is Not Having It and trying to keep her head above water with this whole \"superhero\" thing.

Victoria (TV) 
Queen Victoria (1819 - 1901) (Victoria (TV)), Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Victoria (TV))

Victoria and Albert are fascinating to me as individuals and I also really love them together. Their marriage is so interesting and unique-- the power dynamics and how they fit together. I love how they became so Ride or Die for each other and at the same time they're still feeling out how they work together. It's very enemies-to-lovers-to-friends, how they initially clash but are honestly like 100% hot for each other. I adore that trope. Season 1 had really a lot of interesting UST. I'd love to see small problems with Victoria's marriage that she and Albert have to work through, or them just getting used to each other. I also really admire how they work together as a unit.

The Wolf Among Us 
Bigby Wolf (The Wolf Among Us)

This world is so interesting to me because you have the dichotomy of the \"Happily Ever After\" vs. what happens afterward, as well as some of these stories that were pretty dark to begin with. I really love the struggling underbelly of Fabletown and how people still fear Bigby Wolf because of what he's done in the past, but aren't quite to respecting him yet.  Bigby Wolf is very intriguing, especially at this stage in his relationship with Fabletown. (I do love my socially-awkward characters.)  

You can use whatever characters you like from the comics and the game, although I’m only specifically requesting Bigby. Have a favorite fable or urban legend that isn't in the game or comics but you'd like to use? DO IT! I'm very interested in hearing about your take on different fables/characters, it's one of the things that drew me to this game/comic series in the first place. (I also definitely ship Bigby/Snow, but I'd also be interested in Nerissa/Bigby, and I really loved his in-game interactions with Gren, Holly, and Woody as well.) If you do want additional fairytale inspiration, I loved The Wild Swans and One Eye, Two Eyes, Three Eyes as a kid.

Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) 
Emhyr var Emreis (Witcher Games)

Likes/Dislikes:

- Emhyr conquering everything and being all imperial and commanding, also competent

- I like scheming/cunning/in control Emhyr, also power dynamics

- bonus points if you somehow include Geralt (as a lover and/or ally), who has difficulty dealing with/getting used to all the protocol/servants/pomp/extravagance.

- no retired and/or preparing/planning to abdicate Emhyr please

- I generally like Emhyr being older and well established in his position as emperor, but if you want to do something set earlier, like Emhyr vs the Usurper or the subsequent power struggle for the throne (that led to Emhyr paving his ballroom with the gravestones of his political enemies), then that's fine as well.

- gen, het or slash welcome. Emhyr/Geralt is awesome, but Emhyr/his 3+ concubines is great as well. Or both. Heck if you want to you can even do Emhyr/Pavetta (just no endless pining once he's no longer Duny, please) or Emhyr/false Ciri.

- Regarding Ciri:
While I do quite like (both) Ciri(s), I'd prefer for her to only have a minor role in the story (if she is included at all), unless you want to go all the way and add both real and false Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, that could be fun. Especially if Emhyr marries false Cirilla and then later finds real Cirilla ...
Or even better, you could go super deep and dark and do Emhyr, Ciri &amp; the Slaughter of Cintra. Remember nobody, including the queen, knew that Emhyr had once been a prince of Cintra or that Queen Calanthe (who committed suicide with the rest of the city during the Slaughter of Cintra) was his mother-in-law ... AND it was assumed that he wanted to kidnap Ciri in order to marry her, not to get his daughter back.
So yeah, what were his thoughts, actions, motivations for letting things play out the way they did? What if he had done things differently? (like tell Calanthe that he was once Duny or that he had to invade in order to secure his position on the throne) What would the consequences have been?
See why I would prefer no Ciri? It makes me think too much and fall down a hole of what ifs ... :D

- no total AUs, some modifications are fine (like books vs games) but no Modern AUs etc please

Damien (TV) 
Damien Thorn

Likes/Dislikes:
- no fluffy romance please, the darker/creepier the better
- gen, het or slash all welcome
- no AUs please
- no Supernatural crossovers please, other crossovers are fine but not necessary

Prompts:

- Damien's childhood in the White House (as the show uses actual footage from the original movie, I consider all of it canon, including the very end where POTUS gets custody of Damien after his parent's deaths)

- How does young Damien's super privileged environment of politicians and trust fund kids react to him running off to become a war photographer of all things?

- Damien's life as a war photographer pre-series and how his presence in war zones unknowingly makes everything worse

- What happens in the aftermath of the Season 1 finale? Can be from anyone's POV, the darker the better (that's true for all prompts)


Request 3 by araline
The Young Pope (TV) 
Andrew Dussolier, Lenny Belardo

Story does not have to include all requested characters, just one is totally fine!

Likes/Dislikes:
- Andrew is very welcome to do all of Honduras/Rome/mankind separately or simultaneously in any and all combinations and positions, but please, PLEASE keep Lenny asexual and aromantic.
- also no total AUs, Andrew (if included) has to be a cardinal and Lenny (if included) has to be the pope
- crossovers are welcome as long as it isn't with Supernatural

Prompts:

- Andrew and/or Lenny's secret incognito adventures: this can take place either during THAT night in Episode 5, or some other time, like Andrew going out and about in Honduras (orgies optional). Anything goes as long as the people he/they are interacting with don't know about them being a cardinal/the pope for at least part of the story

- Lenny actually is a saint and can perform true miracles: how does the world react? how does the church make use of this?

- Lenny is the Antichrist: will anyone figure it out in time or does the world believe he's a saint till the end?

- Andrew isn't killed: what happens instead/what consequences does this have?

Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Goosefat Bill (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Kung Fu George (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I'd be really happy with anything you decided to write for this fandom! Maybe a fic that plays with Arthurian legend with a Guy Ritchie twist, or some extra info on Arthur's life growing up, or how he grows into being a king after the end of the film. You don't have to use all the characters I nominated, or you can definitely use more if you want! Gen is lovely, or if you want to go the ship route I ship both Arthur/Mage and Arthur/Goosefat Bill and would be happy to receive either.

Hustle Cat 

Give me all the characters of Hustle Cat! I love them all. I'd love to see any of them in their day to lives (yes, including Nacht), especially how the \"cursed cats\" cope after falling under the curse. An AU where Avery does fall under the curse temporarily and studies the book whenever they can - and in the meantime being part of the \"Jelly Donut and Albatross\" (or whatever name you choose for cat!Avery) show. Graves teaching Avery to talk to cats or other magic. Mason just being with her grandpa. Hayes goes on a date to his favorite non-work restaurant with a date after the end.

I'm a bit squicked out by Avery/Graves, so I'd prefer friendship fic between the two. Pairing Avery (any gender) with any of their coworkers is fine.

An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Miles (An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship)

I love all the cliches in this story and how Alicia deals with them, but I love Miles even more. Alicia might be the focus of the story, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her at all, but it's Miles that is the most interesting. I have a soft spot for accountants and it's great that he uses an accountant's skills to get them through the castle, and also how he tries to save the kingdom as best he can. So, write me Miles wanting to just get back to the kingdom, desperately trying to save it, just Miles being Miles and doing the best he can!

Belsomra \"Cats and Dogs\" Commercial 

I have a soft spot for both cats and dogs, and love this commercial! What I would like to see is the relationship between the sleep cats, the wake dogs, and the owners - do you have to feed the things? What do you feed them with?  Does everybody get their own personal sleep cats and wake dogs? How would the world be different if you have these two animals all your life - can they be taken away from you, and what would happen to you?

Jonathan Sims, Martin Blackwood, Elias Bouchard

Note: Using just Jon+Martin or just Jon+Elias rather than all three is fine for this one!
DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I like pretty much anything with Jon/Martin or Jon/Elias, whether that's just one of them or both existing at the same time (though no Jon/Martin/Elias or Martin/Elias, in that case)! Non-shippy is good too.

With Jon and Martin, I'd particularly enjoy things set around when Martin was living in the archives, after Prentiss' attack, or some kind of fix-it after the end of season two. Moments where Jon is slightly less prickly and horrible to Martin are A+.

With Jon and Elias, messed-up things post-s2 or things pre-s2-finale where Elias is shady as hell and Jon doesn't realize are both great.

Alternatively, I'm also weirdly attached to coffeeshop AU where Jonathan Sims is the manager who should definitely never be allowed to interact with customers but has to anyway, if you feel like something more mundane, and I'm down for things involving the other assistants too in that case!

Other general things I like: D/s (exclusively with sub Jon), trans guy Jon (written so that it's pretty much only relevant if you're writing porn), hurt/comfort.

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I enjoyed Peter and James' relationship, so that's the main thing I'd be looking for re Peter Darling fic - particularly either more interaction set in the middle of the book, or exploring things after the end between them and how things work out back in the real world.

I'd also be interested in an AU where Neverland was more complete and they didn't end up leaving, particularly something where the relationship stayed more on the Pan/Hook side of things than the Peter/James side!

Night World - L. J. Smith 
Ash Redfern

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

Ash is my favorite character by a long way - everything about his aesthetic and the fact that he's trying to better himself and just. Pretty much anything, honestly?

I ship him with Poppy and Mary-Lynnette, so if you're looking to write shipfic then one of those is what I'd be looking for! Gen is also good - him interacting with Circle Daybreak, what he's doing to try to better himself and make up for his past, etc etc

I like canon divergent AUs for Night World - the main ones that are coming to mind are either 'AU where Ash is Poppy's soulmate, not James' (though please either handwave or tie up Poppy/James in that case, because infidelity is a big DNW and I'm not into it as an OT3!) or 'AU where Mary-Lynnette didn't stay human after Daughters of Darkness'.

Cormoran Strike Series - Robert Galbraith 
Cormoran Strike, Robin Ellacott

More details in my letter!

Casefic - Strike and Robin are hired to investigate something, but it turns out to be more than it first appears.

Any of my fave fanfic tropes - undercover as married, stakeouts, forced bed sharing, etc. I feel this is a couple ripe for the classic tropes!

Also, Trapped Together - what happens if they are stuck somewhere and can’t escape?

Road trip hunting a serial killer the police don’t believe exists.

Robin’s first solo case as partner turns into a bit of a mess.

A historical AU of some kind would be fun! WW1 era, noir from the 40s, Victorian…any, really!)

A slightly more specific casefic prompt with an added side of kink: A hotel manager hires Strike to investigate which of his employees is placing cameras in the guests’ rooms. Only thing is, he wants them to be discrete so the culprit doesn’t know they are onto him, so Strike ropes Robin in to play his wife and they check into the hotel. Problem is, to be convincing they have to play a couple even in private, because of the cameras watching their every move…

    Post-Career of Evil Prompts (Spoilers!)

    Robin doesn’t marry Matthew. I don’t mind how you do it - whether you let her find out about him deleting her messages before the ceremony and she calls it off; if she punches Matthew in the face at the altar; if she says “actually, I don’t” and just walks away from the asshole…any of the above! I just don’t want her legally bound to that douche. Strike can definitely help with this if you like.

A lot of people from Strike’s past show up in CoE. Do any others try to exact revenge?

Matthew is killed. The police think Robin did it. And Strike’s not so sure she didn’t…

The Awakening (2011) 
Florence Cathcart, Robert Mallory

More details in my letter!

Florence is canon into voyeurism (both in that she liked watching Robert, and liked the idea of him watching her) - so what is the sex life with Robert like going forward? Does she like to watch and be watched? (Either way, I see her as liking to be in control of it, not so much the idea of strangers watching her, or it being done without her consent)

Post-movie, Florence and Robert are separated for a time - do they write each other letters?

Florence now believes in ghosts. Where does that leave her career? Does she still hunt down the fakes, as well as the real things? Does Robert come with her? Or do people come to her with their supernatural troubles?

Robert is nervous about proposing, but Florence is getting impatient.

On their honeymoon, they go to some of the oldest places in Europe. Surely there are ghosts lurking in every corner. What kind of trouble do they get into?

Florence Cathcart: Demon Hunter (Have fun with it! If ghosts exist, why not demons?)

A missing scene from the film with additional/bonus pining?

I do really want a happy ending here for Florence and Robert, but if you want to do something interesting with the hints that she might be a ghost herself at the end of the film, I’ll be interested if you can make it work.

The canon ended just as they got to the interesting bit of the relationship. What happens next? How do they navigate this new relationship as they were just getting used to the old one?

Their brush with crime has given them a taste of a more interesting life. What happens when someone else gets murdered? Do they investigate themselves?

Alfred doesn’t want to spend his newly acquired money on anyone but Louisa and Alfie. How does she feel about this?

What would their first time be like? Are they traditional (waiting until after marriage) or do they decide to be more unconventional? (I imagine that Louisa would be a bit happier to have sex before marriage - not wanting to shackle herself to another man so soon. But Alfred seems like he’d be a little more traditional. Who would win that battle?)

Miss Marple comes back for a visit and attracts some trouble. How do they deal with it?

Does Miss Marple ask for help with a case?

Lots of people died at Greenshaw’s Folly. What if the place is now haunted?

Dislikes/DNWs: Miserable endings. Major character death. Baby/Pregnancy/kidfic. Drugs use/drug mentions/addiction. Self harm/abuse. Non-con/rape. Heavy kink. A/B/O. M-Preg. Incest. Bestiality, animal harm etc. Nothing underage. Unbalanced power dynamics. 1st person POV (unless for epistolary). Not big on high school AUs or Rock band AUs.

Boston Legal 
Denny Crane (Boston Legal), Alan Shore (Boston Legal)

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! I love the way Alan and Denny love each other. They can and do disagree and about a lot of things, but they really do complete each other, and they both know it. I would love to see almost anything with them, set any time. (Please nothing that focuses on Denny's advancing illness per se.) A slice of life, Coast Guard adventures, curtainfic, kittenfic, road trip, new client, gone fishin', -- anything will make me happy. I miss these two a lot. &lt;3

Peacemakers (2003) 
Larimer Finch, Jared Stone

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! Finch and Stone are rock-solid favorites of mine, and I miss them a lot. Anything you want to write, from a case story to them sitting on the porch one day watching the townsfolk go by, from courtroom session to a slice of life, from wacky hijinks to intimate vulnerability -- it's all good. I just love the connection between these two, and as long as that's there, I'll be happy.

The Slipper and the Rose (1976) 
Prince Edward (The Slipper and the Rose (1976)), John (The Slipper and the Rose (1976))

Slash or gen, any rating, please! Edward and John are a charming mystery in the middle of a charming movie. They're clearly very close and comfortable with each other (despite the usual constraints of position and positioning), but at the same time don't actually seem to know that much about each other, like they've only recently met. I would love to see more about them together that goes into that closeness and newness - anything from quiet mutual snark at a function to a walk in the garden to teaming up in an incognito brawl at a tavern to their first meeting to anything at all. Just more of these two, please. &lt;3

Letter: http://arduinna.dreamwidth.org/105770.html

Tango & Cash (1989) 
Gabriel Cash, Raymond Tango

Slash or gen, any rating, please! I love these two, how they’re both so incredibly competent and confident, and how they’re that much better together no matter how much they would rather not admit it. I would love to see more of them together, however that happens - a case, a night on the town, competing at the firing range, a \"grill the best burger\" challenge - anything. Snark and banter and growing respect &amp; trust are a fantastic combination.

Valdemar Series - Mercedes Lackey 
Kethry (Valdemar), Tarma shena Tale'sedrin

Gen, any rating, please! Tarma and Kethry are my all-time favorite Lackey characters: smart, practical/pragmatic, competent and determined to keep training/learning to maintain and improve on that competence, utterly loyal to each other, wry, self-aware – I just love them. And I love their relationship, built on bedrock but one they know they need to pay attention to (like the way Tarma has to make sure she doesn't wrap fully capable Kethry in cotton wool, just because she's promised to be the mother of Tarma's renewed tribe). I'd love anything about them: the early days of their lives as she'enedran and each of them adapting to suddenly knowing they'll never be alone again; off on a job (either a regular for-hire job, or something Need drives them to); learning to be part of a bigger mercenary force; their lives as teachers and running a school; time among the Clans; hanging out at an inn or resupplying at a marketplace; dealing with a storm out in the open – whatever may strike your fancy, I'm all for it.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

(I'm going to be away from a computer until around October 12, but after that I should have a Dear Yuletide Author letter up for you over on aria at dreamwidth! Meanwhile, a couple of details here:)

I'd love something post-series that addresses how exactly Damen and Laurent start the political process of uniting their kingdoms -- how do they reconcile their cultures? What are they going to do about an heir/the long-term viability of ruling together? How do their various ways of being politically competent compliment each other? Otoh if you don't want to do plotty politicking, any nice post-series slice-of-life with the two of them (porny or not!) would also/or instead be a delight.


Request 2 by Aria
Wayfarers Series - Becky Chambers 
Rosemary Harper, Sissix Seshkethet, Dr. Chef (Wayfarers Series), Ohan (Wayfarers Series)

Again, something post-series would be great! I'd love a story about the crew dealing with Ohan as a single entity, and how the dynamics among them change; if you want to do something plotty, I'd be fascinated to see how Ohan feels post-virus, and whether he is content to just stay on the ship or wants to connect with the others of his species who are also single entities now. I'm also up for anything about Dr. Chef (I love Dr. Chef so much!) or indeed anything about the crew as a family. I'd also be really into a story about Rosemary and Sissix's relationship -- visiting Sissix's relatives, or having Sissix hang out with some humans, or just a day in the life with the two of them, whatever! Honestly anything about the Wayfarer crew as found family would be wonderful.


Request 3 by Aria
Provenance - Ann Leckie 
Tic Uisine, Garal Ket | Pahlad Budrakim, Ingray Aughskold, Taucris Ithesta

I would love anything about any of these ridiculous people! How does the Tic/Garal and Ingray/Taucris double date go? What adventures do Tic and Garal get up to together? What's Ingray's life like after the events of the book? Do any of them end up going to the Conclave? These are all just suggestions off the top of my head, really anything about any of them would be lovely.


Request 4 by Aria
Crimson Peak (2015) 
Thomas Sharpe, Lucille Sharpe, Edith Cushing

Sorry, this is one of my more specific requests! What I'd really love from a Crimson Peak story is a weird gothic Thomas/Lucille/Edith threesome, though I have no preference for whether this is an AU where no one is trying to kill anyone or an extra layer to the existing story. If a weird gothic threesome really isn't your jam, though, that's okay! I'd also take a story about Thomas and Lucille before Edith turned up, or a story about Edith writing her sensational novel after the events of the movie, etc.


Request 5 by Aria
The Road to El Dorado (2000) 
Tulio (Road to El Dorado), Miguel (Road to El Dorado), Chel (Road to El Dorado)

I would love really any story about these three! An OT3 would be particularly delightful, as would a ridiculous heist, but I'd also take a story about any of them pre-movie, or really whatever strikes your fancy.

Sengoku Basara 

Preferred focus on Mitsunari and Ieyasu as a ship, please! I like them in any ways and all ways. Fluffy stories in their younger days is good. Tragic/angsty, even character death is totally acceptable too. Sexy times is good, Ieyasu topping Mitsunari is good. Ieyasu being sweet and gentle and Mitsunari being an angry tsundere kitty is good. Squicks are: no sexy times with them as small children, no rape. Thank you dear writier!

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

Okay, I chose Arthur and the Mage, and honestly, I just enjoy their relationship. I enjoy the way she challenges him but also supports him, and how he respects her abilities and doesn't treat her like the chick in the group. So, you could do pretty much anything with these two and it'd be fine.

BUT. Let me give you another option that I would be OVER THE FUCKING MOON about. Tell me ANYTHING about Arthur's relationship with the women who raised him. It can be a past-fic during his childhood, it can be a fic predicated upon the idea that some of them survived and he gives them jobs in the kingdom, it can be ANYTHING about them and I will do a Dance of Happy. Many times over.

Ready Player One - Ernest Cline 
Art3mis | Samantha Cook, Aech | Helen Harris, Shoto | Akihide Karatsu

I feel like apologizing if you matched with me on this, because nine times out of ten, when I want fanfic, it's because I really liked the universe, and I just want more. That tenth time is when the universe drove me crazy, and I want someone to fix it a little. Guess which one this is?

So, as you probably noticed, I listed Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto as my characters of choice. Give me ANYTHING with these characters in a future fic and I will be pleased as punch. Maybe Art3mis works on helping women get into coding and researhing alternate fuel sources? Maybe Aech finds a way to engage young AA persons in their OWN 70s-80s-90s culture (or just discovers how much of it there IS, now that she's done living her life for a white dude's quest) or something like that for queer teens? Maybe Shoto finds ways to honor Daito's life, to help other Japanese teenagers who are in similar situations? Whatever, just. Tell me about these characters living their lives now that they have safety and cash and their own maneuverability.

Batwoman (Comic) 

In my dreams of dreams of dreams, I would really like a story about Kate's Judaism. And, like, something that's not Hanukah. What does she dress up as on Purim? What's her favorite filling for hamentashen? Does she eat nothing but ice cream on Shavuot and consistently tell the others it's a religious requirement? Does she make the family have a picnic every Lag B'Omer? What's a Shabbat dinner at Kate's like? Does she plan apple picking field trips before Rosh Hashanah? What are the things she atones for during Yom Kippur? Does she kidnap and make Damian help decorate the sukkah at her shul? Anything that's just a snippet of her being Jewish and I would cry from happy until I flooded my home state.

But, if that's super not your thing, you can also just tell me a story about Kate being The Gay and I will also be super happy. Like, tell me all about how getting kicked out over DADT felt, or how she felt when it was repealed, or where she was when the Sup Ct decision making gay marriage legal was, or...whatever, honestly.

I love the combination of humor and gore in the show.  I'd like to see a scene or story where one or both of them reveals that they care, either romantically or platonically.  My favorite way to do this is through injury or some kind.  I'd love to see Alucard have to admit he needs help, for instance, or Trevor forced to admit he actually trusts the dhampir.

The Death of the Necromancer - Martha Wells 
Arisilde Damal (The Death of the Necromancer)

Romance fully optional.  I really wanted a scene with Nicholas and Arisilde, but for some reason Nichloas is in the tag set but when I try to submit it says he's not allowed.

I always wanted MORE for these two in the book.  Anything where they show their concern/regard for each other would be great, especially Arisilde getting a chance to help Nicholas in some way.  I always loved the contrast between Ari, the extremely powerful pacifist, and Nicholas, who is mostly average but ruthless.  Everyone underestimates Ari, even Nicholas, so something where he gets to prove himself maybe?  He has been a favorite character of mine for about 20 years so I'd love to see him again.

Nightrunner Series - Lynn Flewelling 
Alec í Amasa, Seregil í Korit

I loved this series so much, for much longer than I should have, and I still think the first 2 books are great.  I love the characters and the world, but I came to find the books themselves boring after the high stakes of the first two.  I felt like the series stopped holding my interest because the author was no longer willing to have Alec and Seregil face real dangers.  I never felt like there was any actual threat of death or bodily harm to either of them, much less tension in their relationship, so I'd like to see something involving that.  I always liked to see Seregil  hurt or in trouble.

Swordspoint was one of my favorite books growing up and I still reread it sometimes just because I loved Alec and Richard so much.  I loved how Alec was such an asshole but still managed to show his love for Richard.  I always wanted to see him push something too far, get Richard in a little too much trouble, and see how he would handle Richard getting hurt in a duel (even if it was just a regular fight).  I understand why she did it, but I've always been sad that Richard died off screen and of natural causes as well.  Would love an \"alternate\" death scene for him.

I just love Aaron and Darvish and I want to see them together.  Maybe a little jealousy or worry on Darvish's part, him having to go after Aaron either physically to save him or emotionally to win him.  Not really looking for sex but maybe some romance.  I have no issue with Chandra being in the story, I just don't require her- I do like her.

So Doctrine of Labyrinths is my FAVORITE series of books.

I love the characters, the deep and screwed up love they have, the intricate world building...all of it.  I would love any kind of tender moment between them, set anywhere during or after the series.  I especially like Mildmay rescuing or defending Felix, and there are a few parts of the books I'd love to see reworked along those lines.

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 
Attolia (Queen's Thief)

Irene! I think the way Megan Whalen Turner scrupulously limits our exposure to Irene and her thought process is genius, but it also leaves me...well, pretty tantalized. So I would love more of her - of her inner world, her decision-making, her her experience. 

I love her steely determination and moral ambiguity, the way we see how she's had to rigidly control her image and emotions and self-presentation in order to maintain her throne and defend her people, and the glimpse of backstory we get in <i>The Queen of Attolia</i> is devastating. If you want to run with that and show us more scenes of Irene's self-development and ascension to power, maybe places where she slipped and had to regain control, that would be awesome. 

I would also, like probably everyone else who reads and loves these books, be into more shippy Irene/Gen stuff (the scene in The King of Attolia where they're dancing and he pulls the hairpins out of her hair one by one until it cascades down...sexiest thing I've read in a long time), especially playing with how they navigated their messy, traumatic history together and what it means to love one another and yet to have hurt each other so much. 

Irene and Helen/Eddis interaction would also be very much welcome (platonic or not - though if you do ship them, I'd prefer you don't break Irene and Gen up to do that); I'd love to see an exploration of how they navigate their different relations to queenship and authority, and how they get to the type of trust and working relationship we see in <i>A Conspiracy of Kings</i>.

Penny Dreadful (TV) 
Vanessa Ives (Penny Dreadful), Hecate Poole (Penny Dreadful)

So. I adored <i>Penny Dreadful</i> but that moment in S2 when Vanessa and Hecate see each other for the first time across the crowded ballroom, and then Vanessa starts hallucinating blood raining from the ceiling? And then they <i>never</i> interact again? Most frustrating tease ever.

I would be interested in any ideas you have for giving us the interaction the show didn't, and am open to whatever directions you want them to go in. Enemies-to-allies(-to maybe lovers)? Darkfic of their continued battle, or of one taking the other captive? Deliciously fucked-up family dynamics with Evelyn and Sir Malcolm continuing their relationship? I could think of scenarios upon scenarios, but I'm really open to wherever your imagination takes you. Likewise, I'd be totally into something shippy with them, but just as equally interesting in gen that deals with their parallel journeys towards understanding their own agency in these epic mystical conflicts into which they were both dragged. I'm into the question of how their volatile and intense personalities might play off each other; please do run with it.

I love both Vanessa and Hecate as trauma survivors who are messy and ugly in their survival, who lash out and hurt others but are also trying to figure out how to live in their world, with their experiences. <i>Penny Dreadful</i> is also an amazing ensemble cast, and I would be happy to see other characters making appearances (maybe especially Seward, Dracula, Evelyn - or Brona/Lily, who doesn't really interact much with either of these women, would also be an interesting counterpoint), but I'd prefer the focus of whatever you write stay primarily on Hecate and Vanessa, especially rather than the male characters that tend to get more attention in our fandom. Likewise, I'm fine with Vanessa/Ethan, but if that pairing is present, I'd rather it not be the main center of the fic.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alabaster (Broken Earth)

Alabaster is my favorite, and makes my heart hurt and rejoice all at once. I know there were very good reasons for his limited presence in <i>The Stone Sky,</i> but I <i>miss</i> him.

So, please, give me more Alabaster! For this more probably than for my other requests I have a strong desire to see my requested character happy and in love, and if you want to go there I would be delighted (I loved loved loved Alabaster/Innon/Syenite, which was finished all too quickly for my wishes), but I would also be very happy to read more about his process of learning and exploration, his reckless and brilliant decisions.

<i>Broken Earth</i> has such dense, textural world-building, which we get largely from Essun and Nassun's perspectives, and I'd be really excited to see what some of the more haunting and mysterious aspects of the Stillness are like for Alabaster to inhabit. In particular, the Guardians are amazingly disturbing, and Alabaster's particular relationship with his Guardian, who he destroys and also saves, was really intriguing to me - I'd love to read something about what it was like for him to exert that kind of power, how much his choice came out of vengeance or self-preservation or compassion (which are so tangled up for him in all his decisions, really?), how he experiences the formalized and violence hierarchy which is the Guardian/orogene relationship.

Another period of his life which I'd really love fic about is his transformation into a Stone-Eater. I know we hear that his consciousness and memory are altered, perhaps unrecognizably from their original state, and I'd be curious to read an exploration of what that might be like for him, from the inside. Is their an ecstasy to that transformation, or a terror, or a relief? What does it mean for him as a culmination to all the losses of his human life? I'd love to read anything you come up with.

Les liaisons dangereuses | Dangerous Liaisons - Choderlos de Laclos 
Madame de Tourvel (Laclos), Marquise de Merteuil (Laclos)

The Merteuil and Tourvel never really interact in <i>Les liaisons dangereuses</i>! This has always bothered me. We get Mertueil making snide remarks about Tourvel's clothing, we know they've interacted socially, we know Merteuil is devouring all the details of Tourvel's conquest but...that's really all we get, for the most part. And I always wanted more; it felt like a missing piece to the elaborate polygon of relationships which is this book.

I feel like Tourvel is the moral center of the book in a lot of ways, and Merteuil's underestimation of her is crucial to the plot, but also means their interaction could be electric and exciting. Tourvel has actual principles, and Merteuil doesn't believe in those principles! What would that look like between them? Merteuil/Tourvel would be really cool, whether it entailed a straightforward power dynamic with Merteuil in control or something more unexpected and shifting. But a more ideological or intellectual contest would also really excite me. What if Tourvel became aware of the extent of Merteuil's manipulations in her life and decided to do something about it? What if Merteuil decided to mess with Valmont by manipulating Tourvel directly? What if Tourvel someone ended up as a support to Cecile, and Merteuil had to step in order to keep her long game moving? I'd be okay with some degree of Tourvel/Valmont/Merteuil for this prompt, but I'd prefer for the interactions between the women to be foregrounded, even if Valmont is the vehicle to get them there.

Chronicles of Prydain - Lloyd Alexander 
Eilonwy (Chronicles of Prydain)

Eilonwy is the beloved heroine of my childhood, and I so, so, so want more of her.

There are a lot of potential gaps to fill to do with Eilonwy's experience during different parts of the series, and I would be interested in reading about ideas for any of them; <i>Prydain</i> stays so tightly within Taran's perspective that there's a lot of room to be opened up. I am particularly interested in Eilonwy's relationship to her own magic and heritage and history, how she comes to integrate those elements into her sense of herself either during or after the series. Eilonwy has a wonderful, delightful whimsy and way of moving through the world but she is also holds a lot of complex contradictions in her identity, and it would be amazing to have some of those drawn out (those if you want to keep Alexander's tone of whimsy, I'd be perfectly happy to have that as well!).

I am also so, so interested in Eilonwy's relationship to Achren, both before the series and during Castle of Llyr. Achren was probably my first childhood literary crush, and I've always been curious what it would have been like for Eilonwy to grow up around this charismatic, gorgeous, powerful sorceress who was frankly pretty horribly to her while also (I imagine?) being something of a role model. With this prompt I'd be happy with something that stays within the type of tone and content of the series, but also with something darker and messier, if you want to go there. Dark!Eilonwy AU where she stays working with Achren after the abduction in <i>Llyr</i> (either of her own free will or through magic compulsion) would awesome and exciting and if you wanted to write fucked-up Achren/Eilonwy I would be totally into it (though, if you do so, please keep that with Eilonwy either at the age she is in <i>Llyr</i> or older, though I know the mentor/student dynamics are unavoidable and certainly part of the interest).

Dungeons and Dragons (Cartoon) 
Eric \"the Cavalier\"

This is one of my perennials because I never get enough! I would love Eric on his way to paladinhood (possibly kicking and screaming the whole way there), I'd also love Eric paired with pretty much any of the characters. 

Maybe a story about them getting home, and Eric becoming a paladin in OUR world, and having to make a choice to go back? I'd be interested to see him devoting himself to a real-world religion he was raised in (that he and his family possibly didn't take seriously) rather than to a Realm-based deity. 

(And as I write this, it occurs to me that Eric could be Jewish--I'd love to see him as a Jewish paladin! I don't see any reason he should kvetch any less just because he's got faith. :D But I totally understand if you don't feel comfortable writing that idea, so don't hesitate to give it a miss.)

I would love Menolly/Robinton if you can do it.

If not, I'd also love a story about Menolly having some kind of Harper adventure. Please no Menolly/Sebell, thanks (except if it's in the context of an overall Menolly/Robinton story in which case do whatever you want). I would also slightly prefer if you stick to the canon of the original Harper Hall trilogy and the original Dragonriders trilogy -- if you have some burning idea using AIVAS or something else out of the later canon go for it, but the tone of the later books feels so different to me, and they don't live in my heart the same way.

Dune Series - Frank Herbert 
Paul Atreides (Dune - Herbert), Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Dune - Herbert), Stilgar Ben Fifrawi (Dune - Herbert)

Paul is such a fascinating character and his power is equally fascinating. I would love a story that plays with it more, the way it sets him apart from humanity. You don't have to use either Feyd or Stilgar specifically, they just feel like interesting points of contact. 

One AU idea to spark you: if the Harkonnens hadn't killed Paul, if eg the Baron had been quietly forced by the Emperor or the Bene Gesserit to take Paul into his own house--I'd love a story about his power growing in that hostile environment, and how the people who see it react as this terrifying power swells out of their midst when it is a direct threat to them rather than a power aimed at their enemies. I can totally go to a Paul/Feyd place if you want to. 

If that doesn't spark you, maybe a story from Stilgar's POV seeing Paul's powers grow over the course of the period in the book on the way to the moment when he takes the Water of Life. 

One big request: please NOT the disgusting caricaturish Harkonnens of the movie if you use them, I prefer the far more compelling ones of the book.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Gaius Octavian (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005), Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005)

I was so disappointed in the way the show handled Octavian in S2. I loved young Octavian and his perception and brilliance, and then it felt to me like they decided to tell a story about how hot and awesome Mark Antony was (not wrong), but to make his fall more tragic, they turned it into a struggle between him as a kind of representative of pleasure and passion and Octavian as a weirdly repressed creep who made a bunch of stupid decisions and then won just because. 

All of which is to say: tell me a different story about Octavian as a young man? Anything you like, as long as Octavian is competent and thoughtful and thinking of Rome and the future. Feel free to ignore canon and history too for that matter. 

If that doesn't work for you, I would also love a Pullo/Vorenus story (doesn't have to be slash but yay if you can) set basically any time in the series. Optimistic ending preferred.

Ирония судьбы | The Irony of Fate (Movies)

We saw the hilarious surprise of Zhenya's friends when they realised that their friend's choice of fiancée had changed literally overnight. What about Nadya's colleagues, though? How would they react if they learned that the \"Ippolit\" they'd greeted so joyously was really Zhenya?

That's just one idea I had, but really, I'd love to read any fic that immediately follows the movie and keeps the film's perfect blend of pleasure, poignancy, and poetry.

At Land (1944) 

This 15-minute film is my favourite of Maya Deren's works and filled with scope for story, I think, because it's wholly silent while offering many provocative and imagination-stirring images. Could you write a story about what's happening during a scene? An inner monologue for one of the characters? A scene that took place before or after the images we see? A poem based upon the work? I'm really open to your creativity here and would be thrilled to read anything that the film inspires you to write.

Her narrating voice was wonderful, and she's a character I'd like to know a little better!

Flodskörden | Things from the Flood - Simon Stålenhag 

Possible prompts, if you’re looking for specific inspiration (some cloned from last year’s letter):

“Things from the Flood” is the start of this particular story arc - the sudden emergence of gory biotech with a mind of its own. What’s it like to be there at the outset?

The image texts suggest some form of xenomorphic evolution of native species. What are the implications for humans?

What’s the female police officer’s story? What has she found? Where does her job take her next?

The pictures suggest that Annika's boyfriend goes into one of the machines alone. What does he see inside? How does it change him? His appearance in the later image suggests he's not quite himself, but are the repercussions of going inside short-lived, or something he'll have to deal with for a while. Does he come out the same person at all? (Hello, cloned boyfriend!?) How much do they know about what they were exploring and what happened to him (if anything did)?

Why? What led Annika and her boyfriend to head out to these locations. A simple whim, or some larger purpose? Does Annika have an agenda of her own? Did she persuade her boyfriend to go inside? Did they find something in the first machine that led to them going to the towers/teleporters/biomachines?

What's in the pipes? Where's all that energy going? What are the other machines for? Why the gore? Why is the wiring/pipework so biological and haphazard in appearance?

Who (or what) are the (other?) victims of the machine - or is the gore part of the machine itself? Is that biological waste going anywhere? Will it do anything more than just sit there in a pool?

What role does Annika's relationship with her boyfriend play in this story? WHO needs to talk about Annika? Why? Where are the lovers in the final image? What kind of machine/structure is that, and what is its purpose?

Human society becomes accustomed to the new tech. But what’s the price?

The roadworker wearing the stimulus headgear - is he relaxing between shifts, or is it part of his job? What is he seeing/doing beneath the mask? What’s his life like outside of work?

Maybe the roadworker isn’t a roadworker. Maybe it’s some kind of scheme to hack or infiltrate the towers in the background. Maybe his colleagues aren’t resting. Maybe they’re dead, or suborned.

These characters have similar roles in their respective hierarchies - the early personification of power.

Song of the Sea (2014) 

I love how much all the characters grow, and would love to see that growth continue in a post-canon fic, or explored in a moment of realisation within the flow of the film itself. Or how Conor and Bronagh met, how they melded the magic of what she is into their everyday lives. Ben and Saoirse and Conor post-canon, and how their relationships evolve. How they feel about the sea, and the magic that's no longer such a tangible part of it. Macha and Mac Lir - the love and compassion that drove both of them, the safety in retreating to a life of stone, how they mirror Granny and Conor in the way Granny is so intent on safety at all costs and how Conor has pretty much stopped feeling at all. (Yeah, they're very obviously direct archetypes of the mythology, but how overtly do they understand what they are?)

I don't really want to give too many specific prompts for this, because otherwise I'll want to start writing them myself, and in a fandom this tiny what I want most of all is to see what makes this film so special for YOU. I trust you. Write the fic of your heart, please.

Rules of Summer - Shaun Tan 
Younger boy (Rules of Summer), Older boy (Rules of Summer)

What I’d love in a story for this fandom… okay, brace yourself for a brain-dump of ideas rather than a nice, clean set of bullet points.

Not a fic that simply retells a scene in more words, but one that unpicks it and makes the layers resonate. How does the (possibly allegorical) fantasy interleave with the boys’ lives before, after, or even (in a mundane, real-world setting) during the story? How do the ‘rules’ compare with the other rules of adulthood - and those of childhood? Why do these rules matter? What happens when you break them? How do the rules stay with the boys in later life?

What does the Crow want? Why is it always there? Where were the Crow’s people taking the younger boy? What was the older boy offered in exchange? What happens if you do miss the last day of summer, or if you can’t find your way back?

How about an AU where the book’s rules are broken and different rules learned? (Feel free to go full-on Crueltide with that, if it takes your fancy.) Or, the interpretation where the setting is more of a portal-world fantasy. How did the boys stumble into it, and do they ever return? Does anything ever come out of the summer-world into the real-world? Crossovers with mythology? Or with other portal fantasies (e.g. Narnia, Terabithia, Cooper’s Seaward, Pan’s Labyrinth, Labyrinth-Labyrinth, Dark Tower - and by all means deconstruct as much or as little as you want out of these fandoms/associated tropes, if you want to go that route). Character development - this is such a rite of passage story, one of those formative friendships that stay with a person forever. The kids learn and change so much. The best thing about YA fic for me is its focus on change, alongside everything else an individual story might be about. What’s the impact of the events of the book on these kids?

All of the above probably sounds like a request for twisted, plotty longfic, but please don’t feel obliged to go that route! Some of the stories I’ve loved most from Yuletide have been utter gems of 1k-ish words. You can do a heck of a lot with 1k, and often it’s all you need. So, just write what you want, or what works best for you.

What I would really like is a post-Willem Jude/JB fix-it fic that does not keep the ending of the original novel, but manages to treat both characters as flawed and human, and allows Jude some form of happiness. A friend of mine said once that she felt like JB escaped from a more complex novel, and it would be great to see Jude have to engage in that complexity in some way.

-Life after the task force - a fix it for her final episode that actually, properly wraps up her quest to see if it was her father and (for serious preference!) doesn't leave her dead would be awesome.

Big Wolf on Campus 
Merton Dingle, Tommy Dawkins

I've always loved this pairing. Anything involving them coming to realise that they have feelings for each other would be great. I've always liked the \"after high school\" stories where we can see a bit of what they've been up to since the story ended, and Tommy coming to understand how the wolf part of him will work in matters of the heart. Otherwise, pretty much anything that pairs these 2 will be fine.

Neighbors | Bad Neighbours (Movies) 
Pete Regazolli, Teddy Sanders (Neighbors)

The surprise pairing from this movie! I love these 2 guys - the smart and sort of sensitive one paired with the total jock. It's a stereotype but fun all the same. Would love to see how they get on after everything is finished, but also like stories centred on how they deal with the fallout of getting together in the environment of \"frat house\" politics and biases. Most stories about this pairing tend to be very inward focussed I've found - dealing with their own internal struggles, but would also like to see more about how the rest of their group respond to it.

Would also love to see a bit of an angst story, maybe set in the second movie and dealing with Pete's partner coming to realise that he's in the middle of something, maybe even before Pete and Teddy do.

Sky High (2005) 
Warren Peace, Will Stronghold

This is one of my favourite all time pairings, and I can't believe there aren't more stories out there. As with Big Wolf on Campus, almost anything with this pairing will be fine, except that I don't like the \"Warren becomes a bad guy anyway\" story. I don't mind other sorts of conflict or angst, but I've never liked Warren as a villain. Dealing with Layla, Will's dad, during school, after school, all those are fine.

Redwater (TV 2017) 
Andrew Kelly, Kieran Harrington

I would love something set either before the series, when Kieran and Andrew are kids fumbling through their feelings for one another, or when Andrew came to visit Kieran and Eileen in New York, or something set after the series around them trying to navigate their relationship - the last episode left things pretty open, but made it clear that these two just can't stay away from each other and their last scene almost felt like a declaration that they're not going to stay away from each other. Tell me about that, what to they do, can they figure this out? Or just give me a slice-of-life with the two of them together after the series, what are their quieter, more private moments like. Anything touching on the lingering trauma that both of them suffered from the accident and Mouse's death, Kieran's fear of water would be great as well.

Baseball RPF 
Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper

I just love the sort of mentor/student relationship these two have, how Werth looks out for Harper and is trying to teach him about the game and about playing outfield, etc, and Harper just totally looks up to Werth and almost seems like he's trying to emulate him in a lot of ways. Harper is like the over-eager puppy who gets into trouble but just really wants to please his team and play well, while Werth is the grizzled older veteran trying to keep the young upstart in check. I'd love to read something that gets into those aspects of their relationship, maybe surrounding their loss in the playoffs last year or whatever happens in the playoffs this year, or some hurt/comfort.

Give me all the Sam/Lindsay!

Backstory on their friendship or where they go from the events of the movie with Sam now learning how to be a better person and maybe guiding Lindsay in that direction as well. Or just some sex, I'm totally down for a PWP too.

The Demon Headmaster - Gillian Cross 
Dinah Glass | Dinah Hunter

Dear Yuletide Author,

This has been one of my favourite books ever since I was a child.  I think you could write anything to do with the world and I would be happy!  But what do I particularly like about?  I think it was the idea that the Headmaster had such power, that he could make you do anything - and yet despite that you could still fight back if you were clever enough and brave enough and willing to sacrifice yourselves to save the world.  

I'd be very very happy with any obvious 'Demon Headmaster comes up with Evil Plan, SPLAT defeat him' story.  Or Dinah's backstory has always fascinated me - bounced around foster homes and children's homes, learning to hide her cleverness - what happened to her before she went to live with the Hunters?  Alternatively I will always think of Dinah as 'my age', and I'm now in my thirties, so what happened to SPLAT?  Did they grow up, marry, have jobs and kids?  What would happen if they had to overthrow the Demon Headmaster as adults in 2017 instead of as children in the 80s?  

I adore the first two books which I read when I was young, but (blush!) kind of think of the rest of the series as fanfic that just happens to be written by Gillian Cross, so don't worry at all if you just want to treat the first book as canon and then go off piste.  But I know the rest and mostly like them, and if characters from later books show up that's great too :-)  I've never seen the TV show.

No real DNWs I can think of, although for me the Headmaster is always in it for the power and for making things neat and tidy and stripping away untidy emotions - I can't imagine any story where the Headmaster used his powers for sexual control ringing true for me.

While I like dark stories about loss of control and powerlessness, I also like cracky funny things too, and have a bit of a soft spot for crossovers, if you're sitting there thinking 'what I want to write is a Harry Potter crossover where SPLAT are magic and get sorted into Hogwarts houses and the Demon Headmaster tries to hypnotise Dumbledore' that is not going to make me sad :-)

A Saturday Life - Radclyffe Hall 
Francis (A Saturday Life)

Dear Author,

So, err, this is a really rarely read book by a pretty uncommonly read author.  I'm almost tempted to skip writing these optional details, as I find it so hard to believe I've actually matched on this one!  And given how miraculous and wonderful it would be to find anyone else in the world who has read this book and likes it enough to want to write fic about it, you can write whatever you want, and it will warm my heart and make me happy.

That aside, and with the knowledge that optional details are optional, oh Frances.  Frances, Frances, Frances.  The whole book leaves me in such a twisted conundrum of liking and respect and frustration and pity and love for Frances.  In so many ways, she's the one that makes everything happen - right at the start she's the one who finds Sidonia a dancing teacher, she's the person who knows the Ferrari's and introduces Sidonia to them, she's even the person who first says to Lady Shore that Sidonia must meet boys.  But all that happens grieves her so much, yet she never gives up her loyalty and love.  'So long as you're happy', as she says to Sidonia at the end (juxtaposing against her comment to David, in response to 'are you really happy?', 'No of course now, nobody is')

I think it's the ambiguity and the way she is always betwixt and between things that intrigues me - close friends, but never fully family, mannish, yet still a woman, and always torn between Lady Shore and Sidonia.   

Err, I guess that's more of a ramble, and not much of a prompt.  Just give me anything that gives me another view into Frances.  Whether that's her and Lady Shore, older and still content together.  Or some crazy fix it fic where Sidonia comes to her senses (or at least changes her fads again) and Frances has to stand up finally to the insufferable David and help her escape.  Letters from Frances, Frances's journal, any scene from the book told from her point of view.  What was in her mind during that unbearable scene where Sidonia, so full of teenage naivity, throws herself at Frances begging her to throw off her mother, and love _her_ - 'aren't I attractive?  I don't want to marry anyone, I just want to work and have you, all of you' ?  Sidonia thinks, so casually so much later 'I would have liked to take her away from Mother - thank God I didn't success in doing that, what a mess I'd be in now!'  Is she right?  Or is there an alternative world where Frances and Sidonia run off together for Wild Adventures?  What does Frances want?  Can she ever get it, and have a small slice of the happiness she doesn't believe in?

[Oh, it's a terribly long shot, but I'm guessing someone who's bothered to read A Saturday Life has probably read other Radclyffe Hall as well, and I will admit, I would love to read the fic where Stephen Gordon, Elizabeth Rodney and Frances Reide get together over tea (or something stronger) and have a real safe space where they are all variants on God's pattern together, and can talk and be understood (and probably bitch a lot!) ]

Master Song - Leonard Cohen (Song) 
You (Master Song)

Dear Author,

This song!  With all the Complicated Feels, and the Ambiguity, and the Imagery!  

There's lots of things I could say about what I'm looking for, but I don't really know what I'm looking for other than tell me the story that you find in the song.  I worry that if I say too much about how I read what's going on, that will muddy the water, and maybe the delight of this fandom is the scope for interpretation, and going where it takes you.  If your story was sparked by the song, then that's all I was looking for.

On the other hand, if your yuletide is full of Bears, and you want some inspiration about what I see in the song and what interests me, here are some vague notes.  Read them if you want to.

- The relationship of going away (with the Master) and returning, and the bitterness of the man she's returned to (your love is dust) yet his inability to leave her (your prisoner)

- and yet it's more complicated than that.  He sent her to the Master? (And I sent you to him with my guarantee)  He loved the master too?  (I loved your master perfectly) He was certain she'd return and still love him?  ( I taught him how you would long for me no matter what he said)   Was that true?  Or was the Master's spell too strong? She has come back...

- the power dynamics, the mastery and submission (will you kneel beside this bed ... a collar of leather and nails ...  your master)

- the religious imagery.  (wine and bread... some temple... he hands you the apple core...) Maybe there is a reading where the Master isn't another man she's left him for, but a religious experience?  Or both?

- that powerful sadness, that the man thinks she loves the Master because of the differences between him and the Man, some of which are choices of the Man's own making.  (I'm sure that he told you everything I must keep locked away in my head... he never once made you explain or talk about all of the little details)

- the hint that although the Master has given her total bliss (cruised above the ribbons of rain... erased the final wisps of pain) he has also failed her somehow (your love ... never stops not even when your master fails.)

- all the glory of sex (His body is a golden string that your body is hanging from) and the shaming of sex (your thighs are a ruin, you want too much... your love is a secret all over the block)

- the song is so one sided, and the Man is so confident he knows what has happened.  But is he right?  What story do we see if we give a voice to the Woman?  Has she come back to give crumbs to a prisoner she pities, while she's still in love with the Master?  Or is it all a bit more complicated than that?

So any story about complicated relationships, about loving someone, and loving someone else, and leaving and returning - particularly that strange dynamic where actually they both love the Master, and this whole situation has happened because of something the Man did to cause it all to happen - that would work for me.   But really, just go where the song takes you, if actually you just get one scrap of lyric stuck in your head and want to spin a whole story out of that, that's totally fine by me too :-)

Hello stranger! Happy Yuletide!

Here's the quick basics:

I'm gonna be so happy with whatever you create. I know writing for a stranger can be scary and anxiety-inducing, but the fact that you're writing for one of these fandoms at all is gonna light up my day.

I ship a lot of ships. (Lately my motto’s been “ship all the ships” for most of my fandoms. I can see the potential in almost any ship.) M/M, F/F, F/M, threesomes, moresomes, gen … it’s all good to me. I'm comfortable with a lot of kinks. And I LOVE getting smut as a gift. But I am completely fine with gen if you're not comfortable writing smutty stuff! A commitment to the universe and a faithfulness to the characters is what's most important to me.

My Squicks/Stuff To Avoid: major character death, major character illness, adultery/cheating, medical play, eye torture, gaslighting, incest, fridging female characters, demonizing female characters for \"getting in the way\" of a m/m pairing, Rape As Drama, A/B/O verse (I’m fine with it sometimes but only in very specific ways, so probably best to just avoid it for Yuletide), brutal unhappy endings with no hope in sight (except for The Screw Job fandom.)

Stuff I Like/Stuff I Love/Stuff I’d Enjoy Seeing: cuddling, bondage, whipping, knifeplay, gunkink, threesomes, femdom, FoeYay, female-character focal fic, cisswap fic, Christmas fluff, domestic fluff/curtain fic, kink negotiation, character A teaching character B to defend themselves, bandaging someone’s wounds, polyamory, couple locked in a room, first time, aftercare, role reversal AU, characters cooking dinner for each other, longtime crushes becoming longtime relationships, platonic sleeping together, general character exploration*

* You don’t need to include any of these, I'm just listing some things I like so you get a better sense of me.

My Yuleporn letter if you are so inclined: https://yuletide.dreamwidth.org/97180.html?thread=701596#cmt701596

Please don’t worry about trying to follow any of my prompts or adhering to them. These are just some ideas to get your creativity going if you want, and a way to show you my tastes:

1) Detailed character exploration of one or some or all of the characters I requested. Their life prior to the show, during the show, after the show, whatever you like.

2) Your take on what happened after the end. Theories, possible ideas for what’s going on with that show, anything that strikes your fancy.

3) Daniel and Irene, a rare private moment of intimacy on such a crowded show.

4) Sabina and Daniel in the woods, trying to find answers.

5) Cuddlepile for warmth, anyone or everyone.

These books have long counted among my most reliable pick-me-ups.

I nominated Gerry, Larry, Leslie and Mrs Durrell. I also love Spiro, Theodore, Margo, Larry’s guests, and Gerry's tutors (tree-fighting George!). I love everyone's dynamics with everyone. I’d love a brand new episode that focuses on any/all of the nominated characters, optionally including any/all of the others I listed.

There are many prompts in my letter!

However, if you don't ship it, a crossover (see letter for options) or an adventure that adds magic or supernatural elements to the otherwise canonical universe would also be great.

There are many prompts in my letter!

Biggest and/or Most Relevant Do Not Wants: unrequested romantic pairings (I especially don’t want any mention or foreshadowing of the canon het ending); major character death; bleak endings; alternate setting AUs or fusions (ex. modern, space, Hogwarts); “it was all a dream” endings; shovel talks; dark dynamics in my pairings; Dom/sub dynamics; asexual or aromantic headcanons; UST that never gets resolved

Hajime no Ippo | Fighting Spirit 
Miyata Ichirou, Makunouchi Ippo

See my letter for likes and feels.

Prompts: Fujii calls Ippo the Miyata Ichiro Fanclub President in the paper and it becomes a thing. In the future, Ippo retires and takes over the gym to continue the coach's legacy, and Miyata pretends he's helping only out of concern for today's boxing youth. Ippo keeps coming to Umezawa for love advice. Modern AU (or just future fic) featuring texting and selfies. Pornier edition: Miyata topping from the bottom. Shower sex. Blowjobs. Lowkey competing to get the other off first. And, I mean, if life hands you a canonically huge cock, it's totally reasonable to make size kink lemonade.

Prompts: Robo and Youzan texting (with bonus selfies?). The press likes to play up their rivalry (maybe they do an advertisement together?), much to Robo's confusion and Rion's amusement. Robo keeps coming to Tomoya (and/or Rion?) for love advice. Pornier edition: I feel like \"Robo and sex\" is a prompt in itself. Does he need help understanding the appeal at first? Does he get fixated on getting something absolutely right? Does he keep a running commentary? Is Youzan completely unprepared for Robo's everything? (Yes.)

Request 1 by Babie
Scarecrow and Mrs. King 
Lee Stetson

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I have many fond memories of this show, and completely adore Lee and everyone else! I’m really open to any kind of story for this fandom. Some examples of what I'd like to read are: a gen spy story, where something goes badly, maybe with Lee (and Amanda) and his (OC?) nemesis? Or a romance-focused story, maybe exploring Lee and Amanda’s relationship? Or else a slash story, for example Lee's former nameless male partner, that could happen to have been also his lover? I'd love a fix-it where he turns up to be alive, and Lee rescues him. Was he gotten captured and kept prisoner for some years? Was he brainwashed to have him betraying his country? Maybe the demise of his partner makes Lee aware of having been harbouring romantic feelings for him, and then the death man turns up alive and well and this forces Lee to deal with his feelings? I'd love an happy ending. Or a get-together, about Lee with a male spy, or counterspy. Or a dark fic where Lee gets kidnapped and tortured, maybe Lee’s old enemy is so obsessed with him that he kidnaps Lee to force him to ‘love’ him, with old-fashioned love potions, or having non-con sex with Lee while keeping him tied to the bed? 

About other dark routes, I’d love either Lee recovering after a (long?) kidnapping &amp; rape/torture/forced addition ordeal, or any other angsty situation. I love hurt/comfort with hurt Lee. I’d really like if there’s a sub plot with Lee getting together with a Russian agent or Amanda, but it is optional.

If my plot suggestions, or the prompt list here below, don’t work for you, I’d be thrilled also with a different story.

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Survival story. They are stranded on a desert island? Post WWIII survival story? OC finds and rescues Lee who was left to die on the desert?
• Lee &amp; his Russian nemesis team-up against their Governments to prevent WWIII?
• Mission together: maybe they get paired together just for the mission at hand and end up to like each other?
• Undercover as gay/couple, maybe it makes them realize/admit to like each other?
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Awkward situations
• Competent characters with agency
• Loyalty, Trust
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Lee gets kidnapped and brainwashed or tortured
• OC, or Russian spy, or Amanda takes him to his home to rescue/hide him?
• Any rating! Teen rated and focus on feelings is great, focus on feelings and some porny action to back it up is also great!
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•Consensual, dub-con, non-con, are all good with me. Yes to: vanilla smut, all the kinks, dub/non-con tropes like undernegotiated kinks, sex pollen, AMTD, they’re imprisoned and and one of them gets gangraped while the other is forced to watch, and so on
•Semipublic sex, awkward sex in uncomfortable places, lazy anal sex in more proper places
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Hurt/comfort: while sick fic is my least favorite kind of H/C fic I love H/C, I’d always be reading H/C stories, please more of it! ;)
• Watching over Lee while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Training ends up with sexy times.
• Sex bets stories
• BDSM, maybe with sub!Lee?
• R&amp;R or vacation together
• Marooned: for my m/m requests, the ship that find him/them is a cruise ship with only LGBT passengers
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on
• They meet each other while… on vacation at the same location! Or one character saves other character’s life, while pretending to be in vacation?
• Lee got hurt and is recovering when he is ordered to teach at the academy(?) for the duration of his recovery, other character is his student
• Genderswapped Amanda? I’d love to read an alternative take about her as a divorced dad with two children, when Lee meets her (him). :)

How the West Was Won (TV) 
Frank Grayson (How the West Was Won), Luke Macahan

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I love this show so much! I really enjoyed the portrayal of the old US setting, it had to me a flavor of realism and honest research behind the scenes that I haven’t often found in other shows or movies with similar setting. I love how they also handled situations and characters, as a means to explore the cultures and culture clashes of the people native to the places and the ones recently settled there. 

I absolutely love some of both the main cast and recurring characters, though my favorites are the ones I’ve requested, their dynamic, both smart and world-wise guys at a young age, the bad patch the two of them started off with. I love that Luke had to brave through one rough situation after the other! I love that the initial circumstance – Curt’s death – that brought Frank and him to meet each other made them enemies, and yet they ended up to be on the same side and trust each other eventually. I’d be happy with either a fic going on from there, making them becoming tight friends, then if you write slash, I'd also love if you eventually become lovers (I love tropes like enemies to friends to lovers, and enemies to lovers). Or else I’d be happy with a divergent canon story, maybe one that explore a different first meeting and get together instead of Curt’s death, that maybe bring them on different life paths too? Like for example, Frank not becoming a gun for hire, or Luke a wanted criminal; or maybe they are both those things but together they turn to a different path?

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Mission together
• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty
• Spy story, case fic, with foreground or background relationship?
• Undercover as partners in crime, maybe it makes them realize/admit a mutual attraction?
• Partners on the run, or simply travelling together
• Awkward or embarrassing situations, awkward or frenzied sex, semi-public sex, especially anal sex/intercourse
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
• Competent characters with agency
• Possessive feelings or behavior
• Protectiveness
• A character gets kidnapped and tortured, the other character rescues him
• Any rating is cool! So it is consensual, dub or noncon smut.
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Recovery from torture or rape fic, or generally any hurt/comfort fic
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued from the noose sentence or the prison by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Sex bets stories
• Undernegoziated spontaneous BDSM, maybe with sub!Luke?
• Watching over Luke while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Fight or gun training ends up with sexy times.
• Building their home together, life in the Old West
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on.
• They meet each other on a cruise

The Real Ghostbusters 
Ray Stantz (Real Ghostbusters), Winston Zeddemore (Real Ghostbusters)

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I'm also so fond of this show, Ray was my favorite but Winston was a close second, so I'm requesting them together. I'd enjoy many kind of stories, from ghost catching and then celebrating, to more serious stories like the guys having to resolve mundane problems, maybe they need a second job to cover all the expenses and Ray and Winston find a second job that gets them in trouble (take a stab at PI and that brings them to go undercover on a gay club -- and kiss each other to keep the cover?). Or Ray gets hurt in mission and maybe Winston has to patch him up on the spot because they are trapped there for the diration, and so on. But, if you write slash, I'd be really thrilled with slash fic, maybe first time, where Winston and Ray get together, or accidentally have sex and realize feelings, or other shippy scenarios with the two of them. :D

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Mission together
• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty

Conan the Adventurer (Cartoon) 
Wrath-Amon (Conan the Adventurer)

https://bahamut-255.deviantart.com/art/Wrath-Amon-Commissioned-from-ChatonBleu-553381774

https://68.media.tumblr.com/4a94ad23225d9e94e62c5734a93eef75/tumblr_inline_os7r78Vl1S1s5upnl_1280.jpg

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Bereft of the Black Ring of Set, Wrath-Amon has only his cunning, his instincts, his skills, the scales on his back, and whatever he can get a hold of to see him through this 'challenge'.  

2 - Over 200 years of servitude to his detested 'Master;, and every moment spent seeking a means of usurping him.  Now, with orders to Raid a Cimmerian Village for Star-Metal, an opportunity presents itself.  

3 - \"And what use would there be to such a thing?  To trade Power, for Vanity?\"  

4 - \"Barbarian Filth.  You're time has come.\"  

&nbsp;

The why:  

Wrath-Amon, the one-time Gila Monster Sniffer, remade into a Humanoid Lizardman before becoming Chief Servant of Set when he overthrew his former Master, Ram-Amon.  Which in turn saw him gain a new more human form through the Black Ring's Power so long as he wore it and it remained charged.  

This is a character who is actually relatively deep and complex in a series that had a series-spanning arc, given the design of the series (Saturday Morning Cartoon), with even his own origin episode.  

Wielding immense power through said Ring, yet paranoid about any and all threats - real and imagined - that could cost him what he has.  Commands a vast army and followers, yet they listen to him only out of fear of his own Master, Set.  Takes great pleasure in bringing suffering to others (most notably with the draconic Windfang), while despising his own past, his own origin, what he really is.  In fact, the one time he allowed himself to revert to a lizardman (then lizard) was the one time that his own life was dependant on it.  

AUs are a favoured theme of mine, taking what's in the series, picking out a POD and making a new world out of it.  From the small, to fate-twisting, to full-on mirrorversing (especially when the characters are still recognisably themselves).  

As for themes?  Well, Action/Adventure is preferred, though given the setting, Fantasy is good as well.

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RWda9ZlQ1es/U7xuVIjZsoI/AAAAAAAADB4/AvRIIvB8yqo/s1600/thulsa+doom+copia+copia.jpg

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - With the hand of Princess Yasimina in his own, Zamora was now, his.  

2 - Casting his gaze across the marble gardens, his cold slitted eyes locked on their target, already moving towards it.  

3 - A shame that the Boy had to die, but he had other matters to attend to.  

&nbsp;

The Why:  

Thulsa Doom, as a character, while not completely faithful to the works of REH, is still an impressive one in his own right.  One who seems obsessed with collecting as much power to himself as he can.  Hence why (in my opinion) he put an end to his days as a marauding warlord and reinvented himself as a religious demigod, commanding thousands of followers who would leap to their own deaths at his quietest command.  

The links shown at the beginning show him in the form I like the most, snake-headed, serpent-man - which the novelisation of the movie stated clearly he was, the movie being far more ambiguous with regards to just what he was - and I would prefer that that be his primary form.  

While there was a good deal of information given to the viewer, some of which was actually quite subtle and so miss-able on a first viewing, there's still plenty to speculate about.  After all, just how he established the Cult of Set isn't explained, nor how it spread so far, so fast.  

But it does tell me the sheer power and influence Thulsa Doom wields, having achieved so much in so little time, perhaps enough that he can safely show his snake head to at least his devout followers which I feel can be a good idea to explore.  

Intellect is something I see in him too.  His idea to marry Princess Yasimina being to legally secure the Zamarian Throne of her Father, Osric: the Usurper, being an example of this.  

One other detail I picked up on was the sheer lack of value he placed on his followers:  The aforementioned compelling them to commit suicide just to prove his Power; Scaling Up thus abandoning Yasimina to save himself when Conan and Co. broke in; Trying to Kill Yasimina when she was lost to him; And clearly placing far more value on his pet snakes as he bluntly stated himself.  A real Villain through and through.  

&nbsp;

Dark Romance, Fantasy.  These are the genres I believe would work here.

Request 3 by Bahamut255
Cinderella (2015) 
Lizard Footman 1 (Cinderella 2015), Major (Cinderella 2015)

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Midnight had passed, the Witching Hour was here.  Already beneath my hat and wig I could see my snout in front of me, my night of freedom fading into memory.  A pair of shoes flying loose ahead of me, the sound of tearing fabric over the rattle of the racing carriage.  

2 - \"Why do this to us?  Why did they not even ask?\"  

3 - How he kept his hooves and wide rump steady on the shaking, sticky carriage he didn't know, only that Home was in sight, just a few minutes more...

&nbsp;

The Why:  

While there's a good number of Stories in this fandom that give a lot of attention to Cinderella, her step-family, the Royal Family, and others.  There's really very little that give attention to these ones, the ones the Fairy Godmother would change into the coachmen and footmen for Cinderella for the duration of One Night.  For mere hours.  

In fact, other than a Cracked.com Animation and a few exploratory ideas, I can't recall seeing anything that really looks into this.  Hence my desire to see this done.  

And given how little is given, I can see there being a lot of room available for expanding on this idea.  

How do they deal with being made Human, frequently without even being asked?  Knowing that it's only for a few brief hours before the Magic fades, and they're back to their original selves?  

What would they be doing during the time alone?  While Cinderella is with the Prince, and they're waiting by the carriage?  

What would they be thinking at this time?  And during the Race back to Cinderella's Chateau as they slowly, bit-by-bit, return to their real forms?  

Their own dreams, fears, wants, and hopes?  

&nbsp;

I would like it if the Magic takes 60 minutes starting from Midnight (the Witching Hour of sorts) to completely fade, bit-by-bit, as so to allow plenty of time for them to really think about it as they lose their human forms.  

So Drama is a genre I feel would work here - and perhaps a bit of action - but not essential.  

&nbsp;

In the spirit of both the movie and the play, I will enthusiastically accept any content except explicit child sexual abuse. I will also enthusiastically accept fluff, because I always do.

Prompts: How did they deal with Roman culture and the death of their brother? Why are they so rubbish when the rest of their family is so amazing? Is it actually incest and why does no one comment on it?

Pierre Sanchez (J'en suis!), Dominique Samson (J'en suis!)

Do I ship it? Yes
Do you have to? A little bit

Everything you need to know about my feels for this is in my letter and no one needs that twice, so I've just copied the prompts for you. They're pretty shippy, but I am 100% enthusiatic about G rated, no sex fic, and if you have some gen shenanigans in mind, I would be up for that also.

1)Everyone turns out to be more gay than they thought: Dominique and Pierre end up together. Rose and Maude end up together. Everyone's happy and nothing hurts.

2)They're a couple (handwavey handwavey) and Pierre wants to be romantic and affectionate like everyone else gets to be, only he can't because he totally poisoned the well on that one during the 'pretend boyfriends' period and now whenever he tries Dominique assumes he's being patronising and sarcastic.

3)When I first watched this film, I genuinely thought that Pierre was bisexual and had been in love with his friend for years, quietly not mentioning it because Dominique clearly had massive issues around that whole area and that over the course of the film Dominique would get over his damn crisis, Pierre would confess, etc etc happy endings. You will fill a tiny hole in my heart if you write this for me.

Green Arrow (Comics) 
Oliver Queen (Green Arrow Comics), Dinah Lance (Green Arrow Comics), Roy Harper (Green Arrow Comics), Connor Hawke (Green Arrow Comics)

Oliver Queen does complicated and emotionally messy. Nowhere does this show up more clearly than in his relationship with Dinah Lance.

Two wounded people who often can’t tell each other what they need, who’ve lived so long with the mask, they’ve forgotten they can take it off.

Tell me a story of them and of the people around them. Tell me a story of them being brave, taking the mask off with each other, not just their clothes. This will be an exception to the no-smut rule, since in canon, bed was often the one place they’d be real with each other.

How does such a revelation (or the lack of one, if that’s the way your Muse bounces) impact Oliver’s sons? How does that change their relationship with him – or does it?

Give me the people-side of this – behind the masks, with the masks. How do the choices they all make affect them and the people around them – both on the hero-ing side and in the general population?

If you're not feeling a story with all four, I'd prefer one that concentrates on Oliver and Dinah.

I have to admit, I’m not as interested in the nighttime here, except as it purr-tains to the day. I’m way more interested in the people themselves than fight scenes. (see DNW list)

Past that, have at it! There are still a million-million stories in this Universe, and so many yet to be written!

Oh, one other quick thing if you would – please remember that Arrows Run Out. ;-D

It brought me great joy to see this in Yuletide. I’ve loved this commercial ever since I first saw it in its SuperBowl line-up back in the day.

So tell me a story of this world – why are cats herded? Is there a purr-actical reason? Is it religious or have other symbolic significance? Is it a rite of passage, giving prestige to the successful? Why (and how) does someone choose to become a Cat Herder? Or do they get to choose? Are they chosen instead? If so, how?

What is it like from the cats’ points of view? How do they feel about being herded? Are they happy? Content? Resigned? Outraged? Rebellious? 

Anything from this world would be awesome. (Paw-some? :D )

Scarecrow and Mrs. King 
Lee Stetson

There are depths to our boy – depths that weren’t all explored in canon.

Give me a story of those depths – how he feels, why he does what he does. Either a story from his past, before the show, or one from after the show ends.

How has his life changed over the years? With getting older? With developing a relationship with Amanda King? How has his life changed as the world has changed?

And, something that came to me as I was pondering my Yuletide choices – was that initial exchange really an accident, a desperation move that ended up working out? Or was it planned? Did the Agency have their eyes on Amanda all along?

This was one of my favorite shows back in the day, so any chance to revisit this Universe would be wonderful.

Tell me a tale – from his past, from the time Sam was in the Bar, something else that attracts you and your Muse – that shows us the passionate, loyal man he is.

Another thought – after the show ends, does he ever tell his wife about how he came back to her? Does she continue to remember the old time-line or does it fade? Does she encourage Al to try and help Sam? Does Al try? Is he successful?

This was another of my fave shows back in the day, so again, any Al-centric story you’d care to write would be most awesome + appreciated.

Progressive Insurance \"Flo\" Commercials 
Flo the Progressive Insurance girl, Jamie (Progressive)

I’ve been fascinated by the world that is being slowly revealed by these commercials and would love to know more. Any kind of day-in-the-life or other story about how things go and why would be great. 

Or maybe a story from their past – purr-haps the first time Jamie saw Flo and realized that he wanted to be a Progressive Guy as she was a Progressive Gal.

While not nominated and therefore extra-optional, it would be kyool to see about how extra-commercial things like the Progressive-takes-over-the-room phenomenon and how extra-commercial beings like Box fit into the whole scheme of things.

As far as I’m concerned, they don’t make enough of these commercials, so anything you’d care to add to the canon would be wonderful.

Eliza Doolittle (My Fair Lady (1964)), Hugh Pickering (My Fair Lady (1964)), Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady (1964))

I really don't like the pairing canon tries to push on us. I think Eliza and Higgins make great friends, but any kind of romantic or marital relationship between them would be horrible for all concerned. But I love all of the characters as individuals and I love the banter when they're together. So! Ideas, take as much or as little of them as you like, mix and match, whatever. Eliza starts up a business, either a flower shop or a phonetics tutor (if teaching phonetics, bonus points if she uses the \"Hungarian Princess\" mystique and totally pwns Zoltan Karpathy), while Higgins and Pickering are \"confirmed bachelors\" together (wink, wink) and Eliza and Mrs. Higgins commiserate. Eliza marries Freddy, because he's a good person despite being brainless, and she likes being adored, and he's good with the kids and she uses his social cachet to keep her business and the whole family afloat, and when his brainlessness gets too much they go and have dinner with the Professor/Mrs. Higgins/Colonel Pickering. Or what about Eliza, Higgins, and Pickering settling down together in a poly relationship, either as a romance or just committed good friends, while Mrs. Higgins sighs because they're happy but it's terribly scandalous, and if any of her friends (or the Bishop!) found out, egads. Or Eliza marries the Colonel because they're good friends and she respects him, and when they're no longer dealing with the training every day and Higgins is a visitor instead of their host and Eliza has a woman friend in Mrs. Higgins, they actually are quite happy and content together. Or Eliza stays with Mrs. Higgins for a while as she's getting on her feet (possibly starting a business?) and Colonel Pickering keeps coming by to smooth things over and ask Eliza back, and he and Mrs. Higgins get together and pair up while the Professor is loudly aghast and Eliza thinks it's awesome. Whatever you choose, banter and humor is the key to this (though I do have an embarrassment squick, so laughing with=good, laughing at=bad).

Random Harvest (1942) 
Charles Ranier | John \"Smithy\" Smith, Paula Ridgeway | Margaret Hanson

For me, this story cries out either for AUs or for post-canon stories.  What if he hadn't recovered his original memories?  What if he'd remembered, but hadn't forgotten Paula?  What if the baby lived?  What if she'd told him the truth, either right away in the interview for secretary or when he started seeing Kitty or when he asked her to marry him?  What if they'd gotten caught leaving town and he'd had to go back to the hospital?  And if canon stays the same, what happens now that he knows the truth?  Is he upset that she knew and didn't tell him?  Is Charles the same personality as Smitty?  They've both changed and grown a lot over the course of the movie--how does that affect their relationship?  Was she expecting that magically everything would go back to the way it was when they were young and in love?  Was he expecting that knowing the truth would magically make him feel more whole?

Metropolis: The Chase Suite - Janelle Monae 

I love these three albums and the associated art and videos. I don't have any specific prompts or plot bunnies, but here are some things to think about (mix and match as your fancy takes you):

The worldbuilding is exquisite, and makes me hunger for more. We only get a taste of this future. I want to know what makes it tick. I want to know about race relations, and the way human-droid relations map (or don't) onto modern white-black relations. I want to know how the economy works--these droids have some measure of autonomy and money, obviously, DJ Crash-Crash's primary audience seems to be his fellow droids. How does that work, and how did it develop? I want to know about computers and the differences (and similarities) between how droids think and how humans think. I want to know about Cindi's relationship with Anthony Greendown, how it developed and what happened to it once she goes on the run. I want to know about Cindi's relationship to her fellow droids (particularly the other Alpha Platinum 9,000s) and what it means to her (and to them) to be the Archandroid. I want to know about DJ Crash-Crash and his radio show. I want to know about the nightclub Cindi works in in Prime Time. I want to know about all the backstage stuff at the Metropolis Droid Auctions. I want to know more about the insane asylum and how magic, dancing, and technology interact. I want to know about that button at the side of the droids' heads, and what it means that when they push it they turn Black. I want to know more about Cindi's experiences while time traveling. Feel free to explore any or none of these ideas.

I love the neuro-atypical parts of Janus’s mind - the way he can’t quite figure out at times how people work unless it’s particular people he knows very well (like Winter).

If that doesn’t suit you, then I’ll be happy with anything with Janus, though I’d rather avoid romance.

I requested Breq and Seivarden, but apart from maybe Raughd there’s not one character I dislike in the whole lot, so any additional appearances welcome.

Shield of Tomorrow (Web Series) 
Rafael Martinez (Shield of Tomorrow)

My favorite episode so far of this show has been the I Remember episodes where we saw their backstories.  I'd love to see more of young Rafael, before his commission. Other ship assignments, time at the Academy, etc. Bonus points for past boyfriends. Bonus points for recognizable Star Trek characters though this is totally not necessary. I really just want to see more of the young Rafael we saw in his flashbacks. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to write a Sally Ride adventure with the rest of the crew, I love them all. I'd just like it centered on the Captain.

What they did in the year between outings, internal monologue, even what they were like before their lives were filled with Dread.  Include any of the other characters that you want (Sat is my least favorite, but I still like her). Fix-it fic that doesn't leave Tanner in the cave is also wonderful.

Literally my only gripe with these books is how abrupt the ending is. I want 3 more books about Damen and Laurent's road to ruling and everything they have to go through before they can relax-- because I can't imagine everything is smooth sailing after Kastor and the Regent's deaths, or even once they're crowned and trying to negotiate peace between two countries whose citizens violently hate each other. There are so many questions about what the future holds, and I'd love a story that answers some of them. But I'd be just as happy with fluff as plot-- they deserve it, dammit-- or any combination of the two.

Dark, twisty, intense-- this ship is pure subtext, but boy is it loaded. How long does their association go back; maybe to before Luci became a god? What else happens during The Faust Act that we don't see? I'd love a sneak peek into their relationship, all the intensity and possibility, and what it does to Cassandra when Luci dies. Also, how does that relationship bleed into their godhood? What do a past or future Lucifer and Urdr have to say to each other? As long as they're both always women, I'd be into seeing them in multiple incarnations. Basically I want something that explores all the darkness and beauty and pain that each of them holds in herself, and what is created when those aspects come together.

Kim Kyung-ho (King of Mask Singer), Shin Bong-sun (King of Mask Singer)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-In episode 87, Shin Bong-sun competed as Father Let Me Be The King but got knocked out in round one. What if she had managed to make it as King though? Would any of the regular panellists have realised who she was, or would they have continued to believe that she was a legendary singer?
-Kim Kyung-ho competed as The Lamp Genie in episodes 59 and 60, but he lost in the final match. What if he had taken the throne instead? Would he have tried behaving more like an idol? How much stick would he end up getting from the panellists and contestants, since it was fairly obvious who he was? Or, what if he goes on the show again and manages to bag the throne on his second attempt?
-Since everyone's got double identities, some kind of superhero/superpower/magical girl AU would be awesome. What if there are some strange goings-on in the studio, and the show is just a front for these magical individuals to gather without raising suspicions? How much do the regular panellists who haven't been contestants on the show before know? Would Kim Sung-joo be aware of these issues as well?

-Nish is definitely one of my favourite ever contestants, so I'd love to read something involving him. I know that Mark Watson wasn't nominated, but I really love the dynamic that he has with Nish, so something with team Wumar would be fun.
-What would a Losers special be like? I'd love to read something involving Roisin, Joe W, Paul, Lolly, and presumably Nish all battling it out to be the least worst of the worst.
-Joe Wilkinson was my favourite out of the series 2 contestants, so if you want to write something with him in instead, that would be brilliant. The show has a history of setting very peculiar tasks, so maybe Joe has to complete one that's so weird his first reaction's along the lines of \"really? you want me to do that???\" Maybe it's a task that Joe is unexpectedly good at, and he wins the 5 points far more easily than the others? Or would he fail on such an epic level that he gets constantly teased about it?
-I like click and point escape games, and I wouldn't mind reading about a task where the contestants have to get out of a locked room in the Taskmaster house. Would it be a solo effort, or a team task? What if the contestants have to solve extremely bizzare puzzles to get the key? Or what if the puzzles are so straightforward someone gets the feeling they've missed something, like how in the bridge building task in the final episode nobody noticed the three clues pointing to the wood under the table?

The Last Leg RPF 
Josh Widdicombe (Last Leg RPF)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-If you want to write a Jalex fic, I'd love something involving a moment from S1E7, about 18 minutes in, when Josh wore a mechanical tail that moved according to his heart rate, and Adam teased him by showing him a picture of Alex to see how the tail would move. What would have happened if Alex had worn the tail? Would he have used the chance to tell the audience he's in love with Josh, or outright exposed the fact they're already in a relationship? How would Josh and Adam react?
-If you want to do Jonnie/Josh fic, that would float my boat too. I've got nothing specific for them, so feel free to write whatever you want.
-If you want to write something else, go ahead. Josh is my favourite, so as long as he's in the fic somewhere, then I really don't mind what I get.

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-I'd really love an OT3 fic. If you want to stick to monogamous pairings, any combination works for me. P.S. you are totally free to write a PWP if it gets your fancy ;)
-The opening sketches to Flatslam do form a sort of ship-heavy canon, so I'd love something that's set in their shared flat. I'd also love it if you can work in hypnotist!Matthew somehow.
-They have, in several episodes of PBaM, discussed AUs like post-apocalypse, being stranded on an island, etc. I wouldn't mind if you want to write an AU that's based on those conversations.
-If you want to write something else, feel free!

In a Mass Knife Fight to the Death Between Every American President Who Would Win & Why? - G. Micks 

In the blog post, the author has set up a few rules: they’re in a space based on the Roman Colosseum, FDR has a badass motor wheelchair, etc. The author also details how they believe it went down. I consider these to be suggestions or assumptions, or prompts in their own right. If you want to bring other assumptions to bear, that’s cool.

You can take those rules and write any part of this scenario: the initial scene with a bunch of people, or the final standoff when only a few Presidents are left. You can write up an alliance scene mid-battle, or you can write up a single death. Five things fic is great!

Rush Hour (1998) 
James Carter (Rush Hour), Yan Naing Lee (Rush Hour)

This was the first Jackie Chan movie I ever saw, and it holds a special place in my heart. I love this odd couple who are both so devoted to their job, and eventually, each other (sort of. You know what I mean). I definitely ship these two, but if you don't, that's okay!

Prompts:
* What if Carter and Lee get together? For the first time! Maybe after a particularly tiring case? What's it like? What happens?
* Hurt/comfort? Especially if they just had one of those \"oops I accidentally punched you and now your nose is almost broken\" scenes?
* Oh no, for this case Carter and Lee need to pretend to be *married!* Surely nothing will come of it and no feelings will be revealed!
* Casefic! What is the next case they need to team up on? (I realize a sequel to this movie already exists, but I give you ultimate freedom to ignore or not as you see fit.)
* It's a heist! Do they need to get something back from the bad guys? Does it involve Carter playing some sort of a role?
* What if one of them invites the other to a family dinner?

They were together on the island for so long, obviously with a rivalry that eventually ended in a very close friendship. Again, I ship these two, but it's more than okay if you don't! 

Prompts:
* We don't actually see them declare a truce. How did that happen? How did they learn to communicate with each other?
* Kong is also in the tagset, and you can feel free to write about an encounter between Kong and Gunpei and Marlow.
* What if Gunpei and Marlow get together? For the first time! (I am a fan of simple tastes.)
* How did they figure out the horrors of the island?
* What were their first interactions with the Tagatu tribe like? Did the tribe take them to be brothers? Lovers? Friends? Dangerous outsiders?
* Take me through what it was like building that boat.
* One of my favorite parts of the movie was the music. Did they teach each other their favorite music? Did one of them teach the other how to dance?

Miss Sloane (2016) 
Elizabeth Sloane, Esme Manucharian

Pretty much anything with these two, ideally in a romantic/sexual context-- essentially my ideal prompt would be \"THE MOVIE, BUT GAY.\" I loved their chemistry and the complexity involved with Liz being a terrible person; how would that play out if there was also an attraction between them? Are they together when Liz outs Esme (and if so, how did that happen?? What was their relationship like?)? Do they have hatesex afterward? Does Esme come visit Liz in prison? What happens between them after she's released? I'd also be fine for gen versions of post-canon prompts that explore their dynamic, whether Esme forgives Liz or gets any kind of closure.

Failing that, I'd also be down for backstory; we know some things about Esme, but what about Liz's life shaped her into the barely-person she is? What if things were different? What is her life like after prison? Really, any kind of character study on either of them would also be great.

Basically any sort of look at what their lives are like after the end of the movie, or any look at what kind of queen Mia ends up being, or even a canon-divergent AU which preserves the initial animosity and belligerent UST between Nicholas and Mia (maybe he's the one she's arranged to marry? or he woos her while concealing the plot to steal her crown?).

Pretty much anything with the two of them together, along the lines of either romcom-y shenanigans or the sharp humor of the original video, would be delightful. 

Alternately, give me some meta-humor with Rachel the Ladyboss-- how did she achieve her high status? What's a day in her life like? Does she serve as a (hilarious and often on-edge) mentor to young aspiring Ladybosses? Does she ever find the answer to \"how much boob is too much boob\"?

Wonder Woman (2017) 
Diana Prince (Wonder Woman 2017), Steve Trevor (Wonder Woman 2017)

I would really love straight-up shipfic for this couple.  I found the movie so fun, and the Diana/Steve relationship was delightful and unique, albeit too short.  I’m less interested in the DC universe as a whole (although cameos of other DC characters would be welcome, I’m greatly prefer Diana and Steve to be the focus of any story).  In that vein, what about a modern-day hockey AU, where Diana is the first woman in the NHL, and Steve is the team captain reluctantly fascinated by her?  Or any of the fandom classics - high school AU, reluctant college roommates AU, detectives-working-undercover AU, band AU, you name it.  Alternately, if you wanted to stay a little bit more based in canon, what about a different setup for how the two of them meet: maybe Diana ends up in an arranged or pre-destined marriage with a human?  Anything that gives the two of them more time together or explores their relationship in a different scenario than the movie did is going to be marvelous.

Jianyu Li | Jason Mendoza, Janet (The Good Place)

How much do I love Jason and Janet falling in love and getting married FOR ACTUAL FACTUAL REAL in the Good Place?  A lot a lot, that’s how much.  I am utterly charmed by their surprisingly sweet relationship, and fascinated by the oddities of it: show!Janet is a real Good Place Janet, and has such an poignant mixture of knowledge and innocence, and somehow that ends up being a perfect match for Jason, in all his d-bag inherently sweet glory.  Prompts: I’d love anything playing with the format of the show (groundhog day loops! Janet needing Jason’s help after being rebooted each time! Jason keeps accidentally accessing pieces of information Janet has that can help them to escape!) or the strangeness of Janet’s AI falling in love with a human in the afterlife.  And I do love the rest of the cast, so feel free to include anybody else you want, if you’re keen to.  An ensemble-based fic about how everybody else keeps re-discovering and re-dealing with Jason and Janet hooking up/repeatedly marrying, would, for example, be amazing.

I inhaled the second and third books of this series earlier this year, and just love the world-building, relationship-building, and the everything-building of these books.  I really like Nevada, and I’d be interested in a fic dealing either either Nevada’s relationship to her family (because OMG, I loved all the reveals of everybody’s various talents) or her relationship with Rogan.  Feel free to focus on either of those requests and exclude the other - I’d love a fic about Nevada and her family (maybe vignettes focusing on the different times each person discovered their magical talents? Or future fic dealing with the fallout of the formation of House Baylor?) or just focusing in on Nevada and Rogan’s relationship (especially from earlier on, when they were reluctantly attracted to each other but skirting major issues: Magical sex pollen/fuck or die scenario?  A telepathic or soulbond spell?  A proximity spell so they can’t be more than a couple feet away from each other?)  Where ever you decide to go with this, I’m along for the ride.

Vagrant Story 
Sydney Losstarot, Ashley Riot

I’d love a story exploring the limits of Sydney’s precognition—how much did he know beforehand about the events of the game, and how much was he just guessing? Why did he pick Ashley? What does he know about the future after the events of the game? When it comes to Ashley, for the most part I’m more interested in the future than the past—what his plans are after leaving Lea Monde and the Riskbreakers, what it means that he’s now the Roodbearer, how those on the outside are going to respond to his apparent murder of the Duke. Speculation on the nature of magic in that world is welcome, as is any expansion on the glimpse of politics and religion we get in the game. If you want to include one, my preferred pairing is Ashley/Sydney, but I’m also totally open to gen.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

More than anything else, it’s really important to me that Laurent retains his edge—that even once he’s with Damen and happy, he still has his essential ruthlessness, his prickliness, and even that streak of cruelty that comes out when he’s hurt.

With that out of the way, a few more specific prompts:
- An outsider POV—someone in the Venetian or Akielon court, or a visitor from somewhere else, during the events of the trilogy or afterward
- The evergreen AU where Laurent and Damen met under different circumstances would be a delight
- A story about the two of them trying to integrate their kingdoms/governments—no doubt there are potential political problems galore
- If you’re feeling ambitious, I’d love to see an alternate ending to Kings Rising where, instead of getting derailed by Jokaste’s baby, they wage the full-scale war against Kastor that the first half of the book seemed to be promising.

- Elliot+Luke+Serene+Golden as a nontraditional family unit—how do they juggle the demands of their various careers, and what changes about their dynamic with Elliot and Luke’s new relationship and the addition of Golden? What assumptions do other people make about them? (Does Luke raise their collective kids?)
- An AU in which Elliot doesn’t meet Luke and Serene until they’re older—maybe Elliot never did go to school in the Borderlands, or went briefly and then left. Is he part of the invasion, or does he come to warn them? Or maybe he’s fleeing trouble in his grown-up life in our world, or Luke and Serene somehow end up here.

Decameron - Giovanni Boccaccio 

I love the Decameron stories and the way they're a window into Renaissance Italy and people's concerns and lives. Things I like about the nominated characters include: Madam Zinevra crossdresses, has adventures, and vindicates herself against injustice; Alatiel meets one irresistibly sexy pirate/warlord after another and eventually becomes Queen; and Abraham and Jehannot are merchants who are best friends despite religious differences. If another Decameron story suits your taste, I'd love a fic that draws from any of the stories - I like them all. Nominated characters, non-nominated characters, and original characters with a general inspiration from the source are all great. I love historical details, folk tales, alternative universes, and re-imaginings in different settings.

I love the adventure and the characters' different stories, and the way they reveal different parts of themselves and their backgrounds as you play. I'd love to read any kind of story that you're inspired to write for this fandom. I love Azra's sarcasm and humour, her librarianism, and her epic case of chronic protagonist-itis - I'd love to read what she thinks, writes, or reads. I also love Bakal's character and his backstory, the way he's changed over the years, how he's acted as a mentor for others while bearing the weight of his own flaws, and his seriously complicated relationship with Zelemir. I love older characters and the way the weight of their experience is so interesting. I also love Ketta and her toughness and propensity for adventure, as well as the self-contradictory aspects of her character - I'd love to read more about Ketta in action. Wrenna's time imprisoned sounds like it was very traumatic. I'd love to read more about her backstory (childhood or prisoner of war), or about what Wrenna does after the game is over with her new quest to rebuild her kingdom, and her relationships with her new dragon acquaintances (I love Niru too). I love Wrenna's resilience and determination even in horrible circumstances.

The Merry Widow is delightful. I love the comedy combined with such an interesting, passionate relationship at the heart of it. There have been many adaptations, interpretations, and settings - I'd love to read any version of the story, with one or more of these characters. I love the way Hanna and Danilo are so well matched, with Hanna's intelligence, pride, and kindness fighting against Danilo's own share of those qualities, and the way that Hanna's resilience and wit win through in the end. I'd love to read about Hanna having an adventure, solving a mystery or resolving a problem, whether on her own or teamed with Danilo. Or Kromow/Zeta slash would be fun. I like the joke in some adaptations: \"I love you!\"/\"Now, General, call me old fashioned, but I still prefer 'don't ask, don't tell'!\" What if Zeta and Kromow found love with each other? I also like Valencienne's character very much.

I love how Fanny's kind, contemplative, thoughtful, and stays true to herself and her integrity even when all the circumstances and the people she loves are against her. Some optional prompts: I'd love to read how Fanny continues to grow and develop past the novel, taking up new responsibilities at Mansfield Parsonage, learning to love it, and her new adventures. Fanny in a fantasy or science-fiction tale, or ghost story, would also be lovely. Fanny and her sibling relationships with William and Susan are warm and kind - watching them interact is great. Or alternative universe roleswap: Fanny Crawford is a shy bookworm spoiled and indulged by her father the Admiral, while Mary Price is a poor, vivacious foundling taken in by the wealthy Bertrams and her dreadful Aunt Norris - what happens?

I'd like to read your take on Xzar and his madness. Or I'd like to read your take on Aphril - I know she's a very minor character but she has very interesting abilties! A story set in Spellhold or Athkatla would be great, or an exploration of characters' backstory or futurefic. These four characters have a lot of options for dysfunctional, chilling, or ghostly stories. As an alternative, I love this fandom in general and I love being surprised - I'd enjoy reading an adventure with your favourite combination of characters, nominated or not.

Robin of Sherwood 
Guy of Gisburne (Robin of Sherwood), Marion of Leaford (Robin of Sherwood)

WANT: I would love a HET story in the Robert of Huntingdon era of the series, so with “blond Robin” :-), preferrably M or E rated. Guy of Gisburne and Marion of Leaford are my two favourite characters, but in the series they hardly interact, and if they do it is with mutual contempt and loathing. Hence, I love to ship them :-) If you could write me a story that centers around the two of them, I’d be very happy. You can use any of the other characters you like, but please keep the focus on them.

I prefer sexually laden stories. You can make it smutty romance, keep it more subtle with sexual tension (resolved or otherwise), or go the other way and choose something more explicit and rough. M but also E rated is fine by me. Don’t feel compelled to write a romance between them if you just can’t wrap your head around that! Dubcon, noncon or anything like that is fine as well. I honestly have no sexual squicks or triggers (when it comes to fanfic, anyway :-) ). I love romance, but angsty and dark stories just as much. It all depends on what you feel comfortable writing.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, or crossovers, please. I didn’t like the Knights of the Apocalypse audioplay, so I would prefer it if you ignore its existence in the fic storyline. The only exception: If you could write me a fic that redeems Guy after the things he does to Marion in the audioplay (something I can’t do anymore, which is the main reason I dislike the play), AND still keep him in character, I would be grateful to you until my dying day!!!

Atonement (2007)

WANT: I’d love a HET story about Robbie and Cecilia, preferrably something romantic and sweet. Maybe some hurt/comfort or emotional hurt/comfort? In this case, you don't have to include Briony.

Alternatively, you could write about Briony Tallis too, in combination with either Cecilia or Robbie or the both of them. Then I would not like it to be sweet, but more angsty and jarring, seeing as to what she did to them.

I like sex in my stories, be it implicit or explicit, depending on how it fits with the storyline. Anything from T to E rated is fine by me. I have no sexual squicks or triggers.

DO NOT WANT: No slash or crossovers, please. No stories that easily redeem Briony either (except if you precede it with some heavy duty angst and suffering first ;-) )

You Rang M'Lord? 
James Twelvetrees, Poppy Meldrum

WANT: I’d love a HET story that centers around these two, during the time when the Meldrums were rich and thriving. I like the dynamic between them in the series. James’ bashfulness and rigid propriety, Poppy’s perky, teasing, spoilt bitchiness. Please keep them in character but develop things between them a bit more. All this tension needs to be resolved! ;-) An unforgivable slip up from James, maybe? You can use any of the other characters too, as long as you keep the focus on James and Poppy. A look into the triangle with Ivy is also a possibility, for example. For this series I would like things not to be too explicit, though. An M rating, maximum.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, crossovers or AU’s please.

You Could Make a Life Series - Taylor Fitzpatrick 
Kirill \"Kiro\" Volkov (You Could Make a Life)

Likes for all requests: slice-of-life, characters in their canonical setting or in unexpected AUs (I'm a sucker for take-your-fandom-to-work fic), weird paranormal things happening in otherwise ordinary settings, soul bonds (though I prefer the trope to be played with a bit rather than completely straight).

Hard DNWs for all requests: substance-induced dubcon portrayed positively, gratuitous misogynist insults especially at male characters (\"make you my bitch\" or the like), cis-genderswap (trans or genderfluid characters are fine, cross-dressing is fine, shapeshifting that also gender-bends is fine in settings where this is a thing), relationship age differences greater than those existing in the canonical source (e.g., anything more than Corwin/Dara in Amber, Mike/Liam in YCMAL, Tacy and her canonical husband in Betsy-Tacy; use your judgment for others).

For YCMAL: I love Kiro and want him to be happy, and will be pleased with Kiro/anyone fluff or Kiro&amp;anyone friendship as long as it's happy.  

DNW: Kiro and Emily breakup - either they're together (open relationship as it is in canon is totally fine) or she needs to be handwaved out entirely please.

Las Chicas del Cable | Cable Girls 
Alba Romero | Lidia Aguilar Dávila, Carlos Cifuentes, Francisco Gomez

So many loyalty, identity, and daddy issues in this canon! In terms of shipping, I’d love Alba/Carlos, Alba/Francisco, Franciso/Carlos, or Alba/Carlos/Francisco, but would also be happy to see anything that takes place when none of them are involved with the any others. It's also completely fine if you're inspired to focus more on two of the characters rather than all three.

 Prompts that can be shippy or more gen:

·       Alba, Carlos, and Francisco attempt to figure out what to do during the upcoming coup attempt. Does one of them get injured? Are Carlos and Francisco adept at helping Alba plan in different ways? Do they have to take on other assumed identities at any point in the plan?

·       Anything surrounding the death of Carlos’s father/Francisco’s father-in-law. Does Alba help one or both of them process it? Does Carlos ever discover what Alba was trying to do about the will/why she was trying to do it? Does Carlos turn to Francisco or Alba for guidance/comfort in any way?

·       Is either Carlos or Alba able to find a way to get Francisco off on the suspicion of murder charge? Do they have to work with Victoria? Does she share any stories of Alba’s past that make Carlos understand a bit better?

·       Francisco or Carlos (or both) must work with Angeles, Marga, etc. to prevent a catastrophe (saving Alba?)

Ship prompts:

·       Two or three of them have an epic fight-and-fuck situation occur

·      Drowsy intimacy between two or three of them after a problem has been solved, or they’re done working for the day

·      They find themselves in a fuck-or-die situation, either in terms of blackmail or something happening during the coup

·      Alba’s saved everyone she can save (or has to promise to leave in order to save them) and Carlos and/or Francisco seek to find her, potentially getting together themselves on the way to her

Un Village Français | A French Village 
Anselme (Un village français), Antoine (Un village français)

I absolutely adore mentor/protege-ish relationships, and this is one of my favorites, especially given that Antoine and Anselme are both leaders of their respective movements, but, as everyone keeps saying, Antoine is 21 and so young while Anselme has more experience, but doesn't quite have the idealism or the restraint that the Resistance sometimes needs (though Antoine isn't always the most restrained...)

There are so many moments that I love between these two, from Anselme taking Antoine's face in his hands and stroking his hair (even giving it a little tug) when they're hiding from the Nazis and Antoine wants to go back and rescue his friends while Anselme gently tells him that he can't, and that the resistance needs his leadership, to Anselme shoving him away from someone's body and telling him he needs to \"learn when to shut up\" when Antoine questions him about why he blames him for the death. And then....oh man, Anselme telling Antoine to obey or get out and also telling him there will be \"no discussion\" of Antoine scouting a town to make sure the Nazis have left because of the risk of losing him vs. Anselme standing up for Antoine when Edmond says he's too young to be a judge. And I haven't even gotten to the part where Antoine puts himself between pitchfork-wielding Anselme and Alban with his knife....

Okay, so I love all these moments between them, how Anselme calls Antoine \"kid\" all the time and protects him and gives him orders, but also respects him, and how Antoine sometimes looks for that guidance and sometimes shrugs it off, especially when he differs very strongly from Anselme in terms of how he thinks a mission or post-liberation justice should look.

I definitely ship these two, but would also welcome Gen--anything about their relationship would be lovely.

Prompts that could be gen or shippy:

&nbsp;

·      Missing scene after Anselme and Suzanne storm the police station looking for Marchetti. Antoine quit off screen after that and Anselme seemed to know. I'd love to see that conversation, and also see what Anselme thinks about Antoine joining the military.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine disobeying Anselme and getting himself injured

&nbsp;

·      Post-war, Antoine putting on Claude's play and Antoine watching it

&nbsp;

·      Canon divergence where Antoine somehow ends up being taken prisoner in the school

&nbsp;

·      One taking a bullet for the other

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

&nbsp;

·      I love how Antoine's virginity kept being mentioned. Would love to see Anselme taking it.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine and Anselme doing the kissing scene in Claude's play, and what happens after.

&nbsp;

·      The effect of their policy/mission clashes on their love life. Is one better able to compartmentalize than the other?

&nbsp;

·      Post-war reunion fic, where they try to figure out if what they had was a wartime fling or something that could be more permanent

The Secret Country Series - Pamela Dean 
Fence (Secret Country), Randolph (Secret Country)

This series and its questions about identity and its emphasis on honor and loyalty and sacrifice just does things to me. I’m curious about whether Fence and Randolph ever felt their own ideas of themselves shifting in any way depending on what Melanie did or the children said. I’d also love to know more about Randolph’s training under Fence (does it resume post-canon?) as well as more about either’s point of view about the events in canon, or what happens after. Does Ted have to continue fencing lessons with Randolph? Are there any additional threats they have to contend with? Can they find a way to communicate with Patrick and Ellen (in the event they feel they need help?) even though they can’t go back and forth?

I ship Randolph/Fence, but am also happy with gen or either (or both!) characters with Ted or Ruth once they’re over 18. It's also fine if you're inspired to focus more on one character than the other.

Some more specific prompts that could be shippy or gen:

·      Fence and Randolph revisit the realm of the dead (and the ghost of King William may or may not play matchmaker, either intentionally or unintentionally).

·      Songs and stories that were once uncomfortable are comfortable again

·      One or both of them still feel haunted by the dead king and the dead children

·      Fence and Randolph reconnect while helping Ted reorganize the council

·      They somehow have a need to communicate with Ellen and Patrick and try to devise a way to do so

·      Ruth, Ted, or Laura tell them tell them tales from their world that resonate with Fence and Randolph

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help being intimate even during the period where Fence knows Randolph has killed the king

·      Fence and Randolph find a way to send intimate feelings/thoughts to one another even when they’re separated

·      All the h/c here. Maybe Randolph is a bit wounded after the duel with Ted? Maybe Fence’s magical strength is exhausted and he needs to be taken care of?

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help flirting in front of Ted while they’re trying to teach him. Maybe he wants to join in once he realizes what they’re doing and they let him once he’s of age? All the power/identity issues there would be amazing as well.

·      Does the Hidden Land have sex magic? Do Fence and Randolph use it to bind one another (and/or Ted or Ruth?)

Devil's Cub - Georgette Heyer 
Dominic Alastair (Devil's Cub), Justin Alastair (Devil's Cub), Léonie Alastair (Devil's Cub)

I am all about the Alastair family dynamics here. I love how cool and above it all Justin is (or attempts to be) with Leonie at first, and then with Dominic (the moment in Devil’s Cub when he learns from Mary that Dominic doesn’t consider him terrible comes to mind). I love that these family dynamics are caring (though that caring is sometimes disguised) as well as competitive (Leonie v. Justin fencing, Justin v. Dominic carriage speed) and would love to see how that started/changed over the years.

A few more specific prompts:

·      Justin, Dominic, and Leonie (or one/a combination) are set upon by highywaymen. Or either Leonie or Dominic pretend to be highywaymen (and if so, were they competitive with one another about it)?

·      In These Old Shades, Justin admits that he wouldn’t have taken Leonie to some of the places he did earlier in the novel—where might he feel he’s made similar mistakes with Dominic?

·      What did Leonie and Justin agree and disagree about with respect to raising Dominic? Which parent was more likely to intercede with the other in Dominic’s favor? What were some occasions where that situation was flipped?

·      H/C! I need injured Dominic in my life. A canon divergence where he is hit in the duel at the beginning would be fantastic—or it could have been an earlier duel, or something that happened when he was a child (either Leonie or Justin being rougher in fencing or what have you than they meant to be?)

·      Did Dominic ever have to cover for either Leonie or Justin in any of their adventures at any point?

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

I ship these two and am so happy that their relationship is canon in The White Queen, but would also be very excited to read gen about them. The weight of family history between them and the different way they feel about it, is endlessly fascinating to me.

Some gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth spends a period of time living with Richard and Anne as a child. Maybe she’s traumatized by George’s death?

·      Richard and Elizabeth reminisce about Edward after his death, remembering both the king and the father (and father figure).

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth sneaks away and accompanies Richard and Edward on their flight out of England when they’re betrayed

Ship prompts:

·      Anything that explores their different feelings about the incestuous nature of their relationship. Does Elizabeth ever address him as \"Uncle\" after they've slept together?

·      Anything about their power dynamics (Richard's \"I'm not Richard. I'm your king\" still gives me chills).

·      Post-battle sex, or post-battle diplomacy

·      Elizabeth wants to learn more about how to fight. Richard teaches her.

·      Very welcome kinks/tropes: Thank God We're Alive Sex, Spanking (Richard spanking Elizabeth either as play or as play punishment), Handholding, First Time Sex, Loyalty, Kneeling, Throne Sex, anything ceremonial, H/C

The Lion in Winter (1968) 
Geoffrey Plantagenet (The Lion in Winter), Richard \"The Lionheart\" of England (Lion in Winter)

I can never get enough stories about this canon! The shifting allegiances, power plays and masked, feigned, or exposed vulnerability get me every time.

I do happen to ship Richard/Geoffrey (and Geoffrey/Philip, and Richard/Geoffrey/Philip), but I completely understand if you don’t!

Gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Richard is king and Geoffrey is still alive. Is he Richard’s chancellor? Or is he in France with Philip?

·      Richard and Geoffrey on opposite sides of the battlefield (or the same side). What does “coming to terms” look like to them? What orders do they give their men about harm coming to their brothers?

·      Canon divergence where Geoffrey becomes king. I imagine this would only happen after Richard’s death. Ghost!Richard observing Geoffrey’s reign would be something. Or, what is Richard up to while Geoffrey’s king?

·      Anything about their early lives, either political training or military training, or other memorable family holidays

·      H/C! Injured or sick Richard or Geoffrey. Do they still bait one another? Does Geoffrey allow Richard to see him as genuinely vulnerable? Does Richard expose his own vulnerability to Geoffrey, intentionally or unintentionally?

·      Richard protecting Geoffrey (from their mother or father or John or Philip? From Richard himself?)

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      H/C with huddling for warmth that leads to more

·      Someone observes the two of them (from behind a tapestry or not), and with one or both of their knowledge (or not).

·      Richard is surprised to discover that Geoffrey’s a virgin. Does Geoffrey taunt him into doing something about it? Or does Richard make a suggestion Geoffrey won’t refuse?

-Richard domming the hell out of Geoffrey. Is this a case where Geoffrey resists this dynamic vehemently outside the bedroom but enjoys it and accepts it inside the bedroom, or does Geoffrey resist but secretly enjoy it in the bedroom as well?

Please do not include: AUs (though canon divergences are fine!), crossovers, under-18 sex, character death (except as prompted in The Lion in Winter)

I really love how easy it is for Ryouma to fluster Chizuru because he's a little more forward thanks to his familiarity with Western culture. I like seeing Chizuru deal with learning she's a demon and I think that would be especially interesting in this case because judging from Kyoto Winds we won't be seeing loads more of the shinsengumi? Shiranui seems to be tagging along with them so maybe she ends up asking him questions? 

Also would be up for an SSL-esque Highschool AU, as Ryouma's not in SSL what role would he have? A fellow student, teacher? A student at a rival boys school who tries to get Chizuru to go to their school?

I would honestly just be really happy to read more about Ryouma and Chizuru together and there's not much for them! Though please no major spoilers for the second half of his route and I'd ask that you don't make Kazama the bad guy as he's one of my faves.

Political Animals 
Thomas \"T. J.\" Hammond

TJ, to me, reads more as someone who has depression than an addict (mainly because I have depression and he's like me in that sense) – to me, the alcohol and drugs seem more like a coping mechanism than an addiction, though I don't think he or his family see it that way.

I love TJ, and I think he just desperately needs a friend he can be honest with and get support from! I'd love to see that happening after the end of the show - does he stay up at the farm? Take off to see the world? Get involved in some kind of volunteering, like building a house? Start a free food truck? TJ goes back to college? Getting to know Anne when she and Douglas first meet? Future fic after the election? Or even after Douglas (presumably) becomes president? TJ being the fun queer uncle after Douglas and Anne have kids? Or TJ adopting a child and being an anxious father?

Really, anything where TJ gets to be happy and healthy, and I'll love you! I'd prefer you not crossover with any other Sebastian Stan fandoms, please. I'd also prefer you not go non-show AU (space pirates, fairy tales etc). For other characters, I like Anne best, and Agent Clarke. I'm really not a fan of Bud Hammond.

General likes: hurt/comfort, mild angst, positive endings, friendship stories, verbal humour, mild teasing, future fic, stuff set before the show/book/movie started, slash/femslash, developing relationships, gen/friendship, caring and affection, queer communities, kid fic, kittens and puppies, bookshops. Kink wise, I'm open to anything except non-con/consent play.

General dislikes: humiliation, embarrassment, people being made to look stupid, outright humour stories, excessive violence.

If you wanted to go that way, I'd love to read Beth/Mindy femslash - I feel like they'd have an adorable, super-hot, geeky romance, and I'd love to read it. With the baby if you wanted to go that way - maybe Beth and Chris have an open relationship? What if they were together when Mars happened - angsty long-distance space romance? Or cute coded letters? Reunion sex at NASA?

Alternatively, I'd love to read a friendship piece between the two of them - bonding when Mindy's new to NASA? Doing a press tour after Mars? Geeking out together over the space trip? Worried friend emails between NASA and the ship?

Really, I'd love anything that involved the two of them, in canon universe or not - I feel like they'd make awesome space pirates, for example. 

I really love everyone in The Martian, so feel free to bring in anyone else you want to.

I love canon, so if you don't stay in the world, then I'd like something that has the same slightly out there vibe, rather than a \"mundane\" AU. I'd prefer you not crossover with other Jeremy Renner fandoms please, and I prefer Will written to be gay if you're going to write something where that comes up - if you want to ship him with any of the men in canon, please do, or create an OC boyfriend.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Matt Murdock (Daredevil Comics), Kristen McDuffie (Daredevil Comics)

I love Matt/Kirsten and anything relating to their relationship would be great. I'd prefer it on the fluffy side, for them, but I can definitely be cool with more serious stuff, especially if it acknowledges Matt's depression. Vol 3 and 4 are my ideal time if you don't want to go full au. I'd be interested in seeing if anyone could make vol. 5 work, but I'm not super caught up, so I don't know how that would go. 
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!

Mistborn - Brandon Sanderson 
Kelsier (Mistborn)

Anything involving Kelsier would make me happy, though I do love a touch of angst, maybe about the pits of hathsin and his ptsd. I like fluff as well, but I'd prefer it not to be too silly. Kelsier and Vin's father-daughter relationship is always wonderful and I love reading about it, as well as his relationship with Marsh and the rest of the crew, but there's absolutely no pressure to throw in any extra characters you're not comfortable with.
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!


Request 3 by Bluspirit92
Star Wars: Aftermath - Chuck Wendig 
Sinjir Rath Velus (Star Wars: Aftermath)

The angstier the better when it comes to Sinjir really, but feel free to make your own calls about how dark or sad or whatever you want to go. I'm fine with real upsetting, but I'm also fine with just scratching the surface. I'm happy with any point in the timeline of the series, pre or post series works too. I love Sinjir/Conder, but that doesn't need to play any role if you don't want. Sinjir and Jas's friendship is also beautiful, but there's no requirement to throw in other characters or relationships if you don't want to. 
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!

Prisoner of the Ant People - R. A. Montgomery 

Something pre-canon would be lovely. A different case tackled by the Zondo Quest Group, a story about the characters just hanging out in their downtime (my word, the Zondo Quest Group II group trying to do some sort of group bonding activity would be really…something), a more in-depth look at the activities of the ants’ independent activities, all would be awesome. Ships of all shapes and sizes or gen are awesome, though I’m pretty sure Rendoxoll has all the sex drive of a toaster. Also, please don’t feel pressured to keep the CYOA format or even second-person POV.

Or, if you want to go with kid!Alain, something with him and his sibs would be lovely. Bonus points for Fantine cameo during the applicable era, but absolutely not necessary. Also, given Alain’s age, I’d like genfic for this canon, please.

Gen or slash is ok, just please nothing rated “Explicit.” I’m ok with sexytimes, just don’t want it to dominate the fic.

I’d love to see some fic about Ulysses crew, in any combination of the listed characters or those crew members not listed (as always, optional details are optional, so if you want to stick to those listed, that’s 100% ok). Slice-of-life fic, either on the movie expedition, the previous expedition, or before/after the movie events would be lovely. I’m ok with gen or shippy, but would prefer that if you go the latter route, that you keep out of the “explicit” rating zone. Also note that I haven't seen the sequel, so don't feel beholden to stick with that canon if you're familiar with it.

I would love anyone (or everyone!) meeting Earl, if only so he can spread around some of the best tacos on Earth and make everyone's days just a little bit brighter.  Especially poor Rhetta, she wants so much to meet an angel and scientifically prove he exists.

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

general likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Dreams, nightmares, the subconscious, things said and unsaid. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. Weather: cold, rain, snow, wind.   

prompts: Slash, friends to lovers, secret and developing relationships. Pre-slash, something almost, not quite, maybe. Gen, comrades-in-arms, friendship. Post-canon: Did Collins see much more of the war as a pilot? How did or does Farrier get home? How, when, where do they meet again? (Preferably in the 1940s, though!) Collins and the Dawsons – acquaintances, connection, conversations, friends, help, support… not romance. Anything about flying: clouds, heights, the sky, weather conditions; adrenaline, danger, freedom, time running out, trapped, water… Almost drowning.

I’m fine with reading about phobias, PTSD and traumas, just not to the extent that they’d prevent these characters from ever leading independent lives. For post-canon: feel free to assume both characters survived the war and were reunited. I’m also fine with original characters appearing when appropriate, but please not in romantic relationships with the requested characters. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. Unrequested romantic/sexual relationships. AU (setting, sex/gender, age…), reincarnation, crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury (detailed descriptions of burns or loss of limb…) or fatal illness, character death. OTT fluff or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the 1940s. Tragic or unhappy endings.

Deutschland 83 
Alex Edel

likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. The subconscious, things said and unsaid.

prompts: Gen, friendship. Slash: Tischbier, someone else, no one in particular? Pre-canon: army days. Family. Missing scenes: I don’t ship Alex and Martin, but I’m fond of Martin, and Alex was clearly unsettled by the revelation. Post-canon: could be interesting if some of Alex, Tischbier &amp; Martin met again, months or years after the series (but preferably in the 1980s!). How Martin did and didn’t pick up on how the first two knew each other. Alex finding about Tischbier’s role.

I’m fine with the threat of HIV/AIDS affecting the characters, but don’t want to read about Alex dying slowly. Ambiguous or open endings are fine. I’m also fine reading about attempted suicide, depressive or suicidal thoughts. For post-canon, feel free to assume the shot at the end was General Edel, whether or not it was fatal – or even intended to be. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. AU (setting, sex/gender, age, orientation…), crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury or fatal illness, non-canonical character death. OTT fluff  or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the 1980s. Absolute tragedy.

Bernardo Gutierrez

likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Dreams, visions, the subconscious, things said and unsaid. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. Weather: rain, snow, wind.

prompts: Gen, colleagues, friendship. Ambiguous feelings, almost, not quite. Pre-canon: Gutierrez &amp; any supporting character(s) before the arrival of Pius XIII. Lenny’s enquiries about Gutierrez, everything there is to know. Missing scenes: Lenny &amp; Gutierrez, conversations. Post-canon: How about Gutierrez accompanying the Pope, travelling somewhere other than Venice? 

I’m fine with reading about abuse and addiction. For post-canon, feel free to let Lenny live and be Pope and Gutierrez continue as his secretary. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M.

DNW: PWP or kink. Non-canonical relationships; celibate characters having sex, unless canon. AU (setting, sex/gender, age, orientation…), crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury or fatal illness, (non-canonical) character death. OTT fluff or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the Vatican. Tragic endings.

Rivers of London - Ben Aaronovitch 
Peter Grant (Rivers of London), Thomas Nightingale

I love the humor - and the danger of the Rivers of London universe. Some of my prompts are about Peter/Nightingale's (real or biological) age and generational differences. Other prompts are the sexy shippy tropes of my heart:

• Aging at a different rate and in opposite directions: what if they meet in the middle? What if the age difference is the reverse of what it is now?
• Some insight into what Nightingale thinks of Peter's brand of magic and of his modern ways.
• Peter discovers a book of sex magic and practices it - on Nightingale.
• How would a bodyswap affect their magic? Exploring their swapped bodies, together or on their own ;)
• They pretend to be married while visiting a picturesque Stepford village on a case. Cue fakeout makeouts!
• They didn't know they were dating, to a ridiculous degree.
• A bottle-episode story involving Peter's new Ferrari GTO. That Nightingale more or less gave him.
• The Folly snowed in during a winter holiday, its crew being festive or macabre; extra love for the Folly worldbuilding
• Casefic: a scary modern urban legend or Lovecraftian/cosmic horror

Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Dickie Greenleaf, Peter Smith-Kingsley, Tom Ripley

In the Ripley universe, I enjoy the morally fluid characters + identity porn with its mental acrobatics + the dangerous closeted passions in the beautiful European settings. 

• All of three of them end up at Cortina, snowed in for days. Hoping for murder and relationship drama.
• Dickie/Tom: An in-depth story about how they spent their time together early on. More danger, more mind games, more innuendo, more sexual desperation.
• Peter/Dickie: I'd love to see this dynamic explored! Class differences and insecurities, bringing out the worst and the best in each other, being at peace - or not - with one's sexuality.
• Peter/Tom: How does Peter handle Tom's truths and untruths? All the complications here.

• A more in-depth story about how Su and Chow roleplay their cheating spouses. Extra love for a touch of the movie-like atmosphere.
• Su and Chow act out fictional scenarios as other random or movie couples as a turn-on.

Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song) 
Singer (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song)), My Lord (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song))

I saw Greg and CIaran at Shrewsbury Folk Festival this year and was blown away, and by the album (The Silent Majority). This is outright one of the slashiest songs I’ve ever heard. I’ve not been able to work out if that was deliberate - Bev Pegg, who wrote the lyrics, doesn’t seem like the sort of person who’d write that… but there it is. It’s full of hurt/comfort, but also a political undertone. 
I’d enjoy anything that adds a landscape around the events of the song - a backstory to the singer character, to the lord, to anything that’s going on. Or you could AU this to a different time and place entirely - perhaps they’re gangsters in the 1920s? 
Or you could go very detailed into what happens immediately after the song, while the lord rests, slowly dying, on the singer’s bed.

Archer's Goon - Diana Wynne Jones 

Diana Wynne Jones was and is one of my favourite authors, and has been since I was about 7 and read “The Ogre Downstairs”. There’s something about Archer’s Goon that I particularly love, though - not least the young boy with the fascination with spaceships which I *cough* might have identified with. And Shine, and Torquil… and Dillian. Feel free to write about any of the characters in the book, as well as (or even instead of) the ones nominated.
I got a really good story set after the book a couple of years ago, but I’m always up for another take on it. 
Exactly how is Howard going to “ensure Awful grows up right”? What does that even mean? Is he going to muck it up like he did with the first spaceship and the time thing? What can he actually do as his powers develop? Will he stay on the straight and narrow, or start cheating? 
How does Erskine fare after escaping the sewers? Of the good guys, he’s the one with the sharpest edge, I think. And does Torquil end up in his natural home, Las Vegas? 
Is there a chance that Awful grows up like Shine, as hinted in the scene where Awful visits Venturus’ temple? That might be a very interesting thing.
If you felt like answering any of these questions, that would be great, or you can go in completely different directions and that would be fabulous too.

'Allo 'Allo! 

I was, I confess, a little chary about including this fandom, given recent events. I love ‘Allo ‘Allo - I love the parody of (the excellent) Secret Army, the silliness, the way that pretty much everyone in it is an idiot. I could live without some of the treatment of Edith. 
Otto Flick and Helga… The canonically kinky relationship. I like that Flick thinks he’s amazingly competent (nobody in this show is amazingly competent). I like Helga’s constant shouting. I would love anything with these two in - perhaps with them questioning Michelle Dubois (also nominated)... and if you wanted to do something kinky, that would be brilliant, but it would be great if it was also foolish in some way (perhaps they are questioning her about completely the wrong thing?).
Michelle Dubois - I love the way she can speak English (done with accents), I love the mixture of competence (as mentioned above, it’s only… limited) and yet an inability not to get involved in stupid plans, and I love the catchphrase.
Von Smallhausen is a bit of a one joke character… which makes him ideal for fanfic in my opinion. It would be lovely to see something from his perspective - what does he actually think of Flick? What is going on in his (low to the ground) head?

1952 Vincent Black Lightning (Song) 

I’ve been a Richard Thompson fan since I first got played a cassette of Rumour and Sigh, and this is one of his great story songs. There’s a lot of characterisation of James in particular, and a little bit for Molly. There’s also a bit of sexiness here, not least in the motorbike itself. I’d love any kind of story that explored what happens after the song - how does Molly get on with the bike? Or maybe something that expands on the bare bones in the song - how does James Adie get a shotgun blast to the chest while committing armed robbery? 
There’s some space for kink here, too - “red hair and black leather”.

The Avengers (TV) 

I adore the Avengers. I love the artificial world (London streets have never been this empty) and the technicolor palette. I love Emma Peel and the swagger she and John Steed have. I love that their flirting always seems to be based on a mutual understanding of where boundaries are. I’d enjoy anything that felt like one of the series’ plots, or anything that got a little beneath that swaggering facade for either Steed or Peel.
There is so much possibility for kink here. Putting aside “A Touch Of Brimstone” (which is hot, but a little obvious, perhaps), the series seemed to love tying Emma Peel up - and only sometimes was she rescued by Steed. It almost felt like it was part of the plan. I’d enjoy anything that played with that, in any way you chose.

Blood Drive (TV) 
Arthur Bailey, Grace d'Argento

Arthur/Grace, with some real time to spare, like, at least a night without interruptions. As porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. If you wanted to incorporate some dom!Grace or Grace allowing Arthur to be tender with her and maybe even admitting to a feeling or two, I wouldn't object to it.

And/or if you had some typically Blood Drive-esque plot insanity or perversion (medical kink, anyone?) or serial killer AU or dark!Arthur you're dying to do . . . If there's another fandom's universe you'd love to subject them to (or v.v.) . . . go wild.

Whatever you decide, just please make sure they have each other's backs and there's a sense of twisted fun however dark it gets.


Request 2 by Bottomfeeder
Wolf Creek (TV) 
Eve Thorogood, Sullivan Hill

Eve/Sullivan, as porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. Basically, I think their time together was cut way too short and I would love a fix-it or at least an extension of their time together. An AU that branches off from canon or a totally re-imagined contemporary AU where they meet under different circumstances could be interesting, maybe where they have to work together on a case and kick a lot of ass together? There were some mythical elements to Eve's journey that I found interesting.

If you gave them something closer to a Happily Ever After than they got, I would give you huge bonus points. Especially if you didn't shy away from the dubious level of appropriateness of their relationship, but instead embraced it. Honestly, aside from their obvious love for each other, that's a big part of their appeal for me.

Mostly though, however simple or complicated you decide to make your fic, I want all the feels. Full-on emotion-porn is my absolute favorite thing.


Request 3 by Bottomfeeder
The Faculty (1998) 
Casey Connor, Zeke Tyler

Casey/Zeke, as romantic/porny - or not - as you're comfortable with taking that relationship.

Directly post-movie is cool and so is any AU you wanna do, such as no-aliens or Hellraiser or Blade Runner or whatever you want. It doesn't have to be a super-complicated plot (but that's cool, too!), I just want Casey and Zeke vs. the World -- whether literally or figuratively -- with them being really intense about each other and being each others' ride-or-die bitches. I'm fascinated about how they're kinda Opposites Attract but not really 'cause they're kinda two sides of the same coin. 

If you can work in some more in-depth exploration of Casey's affinity for photography, I would give you some bonus points, for sure.

I don't mind angst as long as there's light at the end of the tunnel.


Request 4 by Bottomfeeder
Washington Capitals RPF 
T. J. Oshie (Washington Capitals RPF), Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

T.J./Nicky would be amazing, 'cause there's barely any fic out there for that pairing, but if that's not your thing I understand. If you wanna throw Ovi in to complicate things, that's cool, too. I just wanna read something where Oshie and Backie together are the focus 'cause it's so rare to get a Backstrom fic where the focus isn't just him and Ovi.

Bonus points for porn, but not required obviously. I'd love some emotion-porn, too, whether that's platonic or otherwise. If you're going the non-platonic route, I don't mind infidelity or a not married/divorced AU. However you decide to handle the wives not being the focus is fine. Nothing against them, they're just not my obsession the way Nicklas and T.J. are.

If you wanna do some crazy Mafia or Harry Potter AU or keep it totally canon, I'm down with whatever inspires you. I don't mind angst as long as things de-angst themselves in the end. Actually, I love angst that turns into happiness. 

As long as they feel like T.J. and Nicky, I'm pretty open. Just please god no depressing endings. It's soul-crushing enough being a Caps fan most of the time.

SUPER EXTRA BONUS POINTS FOR SIDNEY \"FINGER-CHOPPER\" CROSBY GETTING HIS COMEUPPANCE IN SOME WAY. OR T.J. AND BACKIE EXPRESSING THEIR (MY) UTTER CONTEMPT. If you do not share my loathing, then probably best to just mention him as little as possible.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Matt Murdock (Daredevil Comics), Elektra Natchios (Daredevil comics)

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I like explorations of Matt’s senses and limitations in pretty much any context. The comics don't do a good job of giving him limitations (and the show is even worse tbh).

I like Matt being a control freak but still not having control.

I like Matt needing help, even if he’s shitty at asking for it. I like missing scenes. I like tough situations. I don’t have any really good prompts, I apologise.

For something from Elektra's focal point, I am interested in WHY Matt. Why are they drawn to him, why do they fight with/for him, why do they care about him. Elektra moves in and out of Matt's life. Why doesn't she just steer clear of him; it's not like she doesn't know he's a disaster? 

There’s some nonsense about Matt in my letter post, feel free to hop over there. AS A NOTE, I really am not a huge fan of how Mark Waid writes Matt. I like angsty Daredevil way more than weird, shave-my-head-wear-a-terrible-suit and have a manic episode Daredevil. I'm not saying DON'T WRITE WAID-ERA so much as I'm saying, keep some of his darkness if you can! I like his darkness. I'm not up to date on the new run of DD so avoiding that is probably best just so I understand the context. My fave era of DD is around the time he ends up in Ryker's when he's being all I'M THE KINGPIN. Though honestly, putting a story in any vague era is totally fine, canon compliance is definitely not required.

I would prefer not to have fic with Kirsten or Karen as a focal point. I also REALLY LOVE Matt's friendship with Foggy and if you want to talk about how much that matters to him, I am here for this! I think platonic relationships don't get anywhere near enough attention or importance in fandom. I don't ship Matt with Foggy at all but I love their friendship. Obviously I didn't pick Foggy here so if he's nowhere to be found that's totally fine as well - I just want you as an author to have more details rather than less? I don't know.&nbsp;

For these characters as a ship: I think this relationship is endlessly complicated because they have very very different moral compasses. Although I don’t think Matt’s is really perfect (especially if we actually count Shadowland as canon), it’s not anywhere near as off base as Elektra’s. And they’ve been enemies, but they’re not always. Elektra saved his life, after all! Like with Danny or Frank, I’d love to see WHY she’s so drawn to him, in spite of herself. What she thinks of the man that he grew up to be, and how they relate now. Also femdom here is totally appreciated if you’re into the sexy fic!

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I am obsessed with this world building. My big gripe about this book is there just was not enough of it, not enough backstory. The book is ALL ACTION PACKED and I absolutely adored every second but I want more. I'd actually love to have more set in Neverland, before Hook freaks out and decides he needs to go home, or something that juxtaposes their time in Neverland with their time in the real world. I'm also really into the idea of Hook teaching Peter about love and relationships and whatever.

They could have an adventure together (in either world).

Neither of them seems to be wired for quiet domestic life, not really, so how do they adjust to the idea of that? How do they spice it up?

Discovering the world and each other together, or going back to Neverland, or finding another fantasy, or more backstory, or taking what is already there and building a slower burn between them, I'm down for all of it.

I'm also obviously down for dirty dirty porn so if that's your thing, write that. 

I'm definitely fine with Ernest being included in any capacity; I didn't specifically request him bc I don't want a fic about just him but if you throw him in, that's fine!

Terminator Genisys

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

PROMPTS: The future being undone, the future NOT being undone, growing up a soldier, the differences/similarities in Sarah's upbringing and Kyle's, saving humanity, learning to trust a robot

I would LOVE to see something in the veins of the older films where the T-800 isn't just comic relief. Or combining ideas from the Sarah Connor Chronicles, with the machine ACTUALLY learning to be human instead of just being like super awkward for 40 years or something??? I would really like to see that.

I'm especially interested in Pops learning *from Sarah* how to be human. And I want Sarah to be MORE than just some incubator for the human savior. She's more than that and the older movies especially throw that away. The new movie throws it away less (which is part of what I liked about it), but I think it could go further.

ALSO I didn't like the gimmick of robot aging, so if you scrap that, I'm fine with it. (Actually, it could make a REALLY interesting time: how do they handle Pops not actually aging throughout all these years? I'm fine with his machinery wearing out some bc they don't have proper upkeep techniques but I don't see why the T-800 would be made so it AGED.)

Only thing I really do not want is NO PREGNANCY TALK AT ALL, no character death.

If you're including Kyle, that's fine and welcome, but I am not terribly interested in a romance with Sarah and Kyle. I don't think they're there yet. Exploring them learning to get along and maybe finding things that they enjoy about each other, a more organic thing than just \"we have sex and you die 48 hours later and I spend one movie and a TV series crying about what a great guy you were\" is great!

Mr. Robot (TV) 
Elliot Alderson, Tyrell Wellick, Edward Alderson | Mr. Robot

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

There is so much to explore in Mr. Robot that I'm not even sure where to start with it.

Even though Elliot and Mr. Robot share the same body, we see in s1 especially that they interact as if they don't. Mr. Robot looks like and is based on Elliot's dad, but from what we've seen of his actual dad, they're not actually the same. Before Elliot realises any of this, their relationship could be pretty much anything. Mr. Robot is bonkers and is willing to put Elliot in severe danger, but he's also willing to try to save him from it. Anything you want to do with that is fine.

For Tyrell, does he realise the difference between Mr. Robot and Elliot? He's pretty perceptive, and obviously he was working with Mr. Robot without Elliot's knowledge, for some time. What if he DOES know the difference between them, or figures out that two people live in Elliot's body? How does he purposefully interact with them differently? Does he play them off each other? Also, at the end of s2, he tells Angela he loves Elliot. Where did that come from? Fill in missing scenes, make something up, I don't know.

I love Angela so if you want to include her, please do. I don't really care for Darlene so I'd prefer she not have a central role to play if she shows up. 

AS A NOTE, I realise that the third season will have started by the time yuletide opens but I would like to request that you NOT write anything relating to the third season because I don't know how easily accessible it will be to me so while I'd like to keep up on it, I may not be able to and I really hate spoilers! Sorry about that.

National Football League RPF 
Aaron Rodgers (National Football League RPF)

I would really like a fic in which Aaron falls in love with a guy (or is in an established relationship with one). Anybody on his team would be great! I like coming-out fics if you'd like to write about how Aaron and his boyfriend become the first out active NFL players, but that's not a must. Hurt/comfort after an injury or defeat would be great, or celebration fic after a victory/record-breaking game. I love basically all the romance tropes, and I also really like the game of football, so if you do too you can definitely use all the detail you like.

If you can't see Aaron with any of his current teammates, future fic in which he's an analyst and falls in love with a fellow analyst would be cool too! Alex Smith, maybe? Colin Kaepernick? Odell Beckham Jr.? 

My DNWs are Aaron in a het relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and bodily fluids kinks.

For this fandom my ship is Ovi/hockey. No other ships, please (though Ovi teasingly flirting with everyone is okay, and pretty much canon anyways). 

So Ovi just started the season by scoring 3 goals in the first game and 4 goals in the second. Obviously this is not sustainable - or is it? Crack fic in which Ovi just keeps scoring hat tricks, game after game, and the team half thinks he made a deal with the devil, would be great. Does he start racking up superstitions and/or gameday rituals? 

OR I would very, very much like fic in which the Caps win the Cup, with Ovi scoring the winning goal in uber-dramatic fashion. :D

Or just Ovi kicking butt and taking names and playing epic pranks on the rest of the locker room between the kicking butt and taking names.

My DNWs are Ovi in a relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and the Chicago Blackhawks.

Tennis RPF 
Roger Federer (Tennis RPF), Severin Luthi (Tennis RPF), Stanislas Wawrinka (Tennis RPF)

Roger's the most successful tennis player of all time, and it's due in large part to Seve. What people don't know is that Seve isn't just Roger's coach, he's his dom too. Behind closed doors, Roger lets off stress by happily surrendering control to Seve and giving him everything he asks for. When Stan starts trying to improve his game, he comes to Roger and asks for advice. Roger points him towards Seve...

Any and all kinks are more than welcome here. Roger as an eager sub is my happy place, but Stan can be more reluctant/troublesome. And threesomes with Seve domming them both is good too. Public use in a locker room? Exhibitionism where someone might come by? Seve having Stan help him double-penetrate Fed? Seve making them play practice sets with his come in them? Get as FILTHY as you like! :D

(If you are totally on board with Seve/Fed but can't make Stan work, you can leave him out.)

If this isn't something you want to write, then gen teamfic or vanilla Fed/Stan shippiness based around Davis Cup is fine too.

My DNWs are Fed topping and/or being dominant, any mention of WAGs, anyone involved angsting about whether this is Decent, and paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death.

Benjamin January Mysteries - Barbara Hambly 
Benjamin January, Hannibal Sefton, Rose Vitrac January

Some of my favorite things about this series are the amazing historical detail and world-building, the treatment of complex real-world issues, and the kindness and respect and love of the characters for one another, as well as their humor and total dorkiness. I love how huge the world is; you could write a story about any background character and I would be fascinated by it. With Rose, I love her determination and stubbornness to have the life she wants, and how she's capable of being utterly ruthless when the situation calls for it. I also love her awkward, logical kindness. She tends to prefer books to people, and I am SO THERE with her. I love how cool and unemotional she is in a crisis, and her wry sense of humor at others' more dramatic emotions.
With Hannibal, I love that he is SUCH a fucking failbucket, and yet utterly aware of it, and how he's so grateful to those who are friends with him anyway. I really like the times when he manages to subtly undercut the privileges of his position compared to the others. I love how he makes friends with absolutely everyone he meets, and I love the slow growth over the series of his natural empathy, from a passive, fatalistic sympathy to actively going out of his way to do what he can for others. 
With Ben, I love how he is justly angry about the world he lives in, and yet how he manages to take that anger and turn it into working to make change happen. He has intense abandonment issues, and I love how important friends and family are to him, and how he is constantly striving to build a community around himself. I love his sense of pride, the way his desire to be seen as proper and respectable conflicts with his frequent attraction to people who are outcasts in one way or another. I love how good he is at code-switching and making people see what they want to see; he is a good man, but godDAMN he is sneaky when he needs to be. 

Optional Prompts:
– I would love a first-time, getting together fic for my OT3 set immediately after Crimson Angel. It’s such a dramatic book, with a ton of lovely tender moments between all three of them and so many fun tropes (Rose pretending to be Hannibal’s concubine! Ben thinking Hannibal was dead! Dramatic rescues! Bullet wounds!) and I really would love to indulge in even more of it. 
– I love canon-divergence AUs. One idea I was considering: what if Rose hadn’t been pregnant at the time of The Shirt on His Back? Would she have traveled with the others to Oregon? Or would Hannibal have stayed in New Orleans with her, leaving Ben and Shaw on their own? I would LOVE to see crossdressed Rose exploring the Wild West, but Rose and Hannibal forced to deal with his withdrawal on their own and despite societal disapproval would be excellent too. 
– EPISTOLARY FIC PLZ. I always love it when Hambly includes notes written by the characters in the books; I’m so fascinated even by little details like how they address one another (‘amicus meus’ is so cute it kills me) or how they manage to include secret messages that outside observers wouldn’t understand (whether that’s slipping into Latin or Greek, or codewords, or Shakespeare quotations). They do send a lot of letters and short notes in the books, and I’d love to see more of them: Hannibal’s letters from Mexico, Ben’s letters from Oregon or Washington DC, short notes during a normal day around the city, whatever.
– Loyalty kink: there’s a lot of moments in the books where one character has to simply trust that another won’t betray them, because they’re unable to talk directly due to outsiders listening in or them being separated. There are so many societal factors holding these characters apart, and I love how they work around them (usually subtly and sneakily, but sometimes very blatantly!) to maintain their trust and friendship. This is my JAM. Especially if one character goes through a period of angst, believing they might have been betrayed or abandoned, before the other(s) proves their loyalty by coming through with a happy ending. Examples from canon: when Ben is afraid Hannibal has abandoned him in Sold Down the River, before finding out that Hannibal was really kidnapped; in Dead Water, when Ben and Hannibal are unable to speak directly to one another to maintain their cover story, and are confronted by Molloy and Davis unexpectedly. The way they manage to back up each other despite having no plan is delicious. I just want to wallow in a ton of angst and loyalty and trust.
– I realize she’s not nominated, but I would also LOVE to get fic from Livia’s POV. Either backstory (a story about her as a child, as a young woman, from when her children were young, etc) or her view on a scene from canon. Or what does she think about Rose, about Hannibal, about the OT3? 

PS: I have already read 'Murder in July', so if you want to include details from that one, feel free!

Underground (TV) 
Cato (Underground), Georgia (Underground), Rosalee (Underground)

I am so, so sad about this show getting canceled (though I am holding out hope some other channel picks it up!) and so I would love fanfic as a chance to spend a little more time with these characters. I love the heist take on the material, I love the big action sequences, the huge twists in practically every episode, the gray morality and that there are no clear lines between \"good\" characters and \"bad\" characters. I love the exploration of an underserved area of American history, but I also love that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is willing to have fun with these characters and their melodrama. 
Cato is probably my favorite character (though I love the others as well!). He’s completely self-serving, ruthless, manipulative, cunning, and I love that about him. I love his dry sarcasm and the way he’s constantly pushing at others, testing them, testing himself. I love how he refuses to trust anyone else, and the way we learn he’s been hiding a deep loss all along. I want to know why he does what he does, what's driving him –&nbsp;though I suspect even he doesn't really know. 

&nbsp;

Optional Prompts:
– Backstory about Cato, since we know so little of his past. What was his relationship like with Noah before Episode One? Had he ever interacted with Rosalee before (it seems likely, since they both have relatively elevated positions)? What about his family or childhood? 
– The episode in Season One where Cato and Rosalee dressed up and pretended to be rich was THE BEST THING EVER. I would love a missing scene set during that time, or an AU where they had to stretch the deception out longer. What if they’d had to spend the night together? Just tell me more about their awkward intimacy! :D
– I'm pretty fascinated by Cato and Devi's relationship. I want to know all about it –&nbsp;what does she see in him? what does he see in her? Fic about their time together while Cato spends fortunes and self-destructs across Europe would be GREAT. I'd also be completely head-over-heels for any backstory about Devi: her childhood, her previous relationships, why she decides to follow Cato to America, any of that.
– I totally ship Georgia/Elizabeth and fic about them would make my day. Fluffy, angsty, first-time, established relationship – any way you want to go with it would be awesome to me. Georgia backstory would also be great: how did she come to make the choice to pass for white? What was her husband like? What is her relationship with John Brown and family like? 
– On another note, I absolutely love Clara and would be so very very into fic focusing on her. She's another deliciously ruthless character, and I am really enjoying seeing her learn how to get power and use it.

Books of the Raksura - Martha Wells 
Chime (Books of the Raksura), Consolation (Books of the Raksura)

This is very much an OR request (though if you can think of some reason to have them in the same room, I'm all for it!). In fact, I really love all of the characters in the tag set and would be happy with fic focusing on any of them; these two are just my favorites, which is why I chose them. 
I love this fandom for its incredible worldbuilding; every single one of the books has some setpiece that just fascinates me with its originality and weirdness, from a city inside a tree to underground pyramids to giant sea-turtles with cities on their backs to, of course, the Raksura gender/caste politics. I also love Moon and his struggle to understand Raksuran culture and the emotional difficulties of being part of a family and a colony; I love Chime's sweet awkwardness; I love Consolation's determination and misguided attempts to do good. 

Optional Prompts:
– I'd love more about Chime's transition from Mentor to Warrior, and all the many ways he must have had to adjust: mentally, physically, socially, etc. It might be interesting to see someone else's POV on that change too, or more about other people who have made the same change throughout history.
– Chime and Moon are obviously together, and Moon and Jade, but do Chime and Jade have any particular closeness? I'd love more on what they think of each other, or just see them spending time together, alone or with Moon as well. I could see this being either platonic or sexual, so feel free to go either way.
–&nbsp;I know this is probably what everyone will be asking for this Yuletide, but I am SO FASCINATED by Consolation. How does her setting up in a tree in the Reaches actually work? What about trading missions with other Raksura courts? Does she convince a consort to join her, and if so how? Do any Abora volunteer to join them and help them learn how to function? What does the next generation look like?
– I'd love a fic about Consolation as a young child. Maybe even from the POV of her father? What was that like, for him or for her, growing up in a place where they only had each other to understand them? A scene about her getting her name would <i>break my heart</i> in the best of ways. Or maybe a story about the father trying to teach her about the Raksura? Or one about Consolation making allies among the Kethel for the first time?
– I also really love Delin, and anything about him interacting with the Raksura would be excellent. Him asking questions to write his book? Him explaining to them about the Golden Isles or some other culture? Him helping out when they get into a tangle with another Raksura court? Just give me this fearless old nerd man and his curious lizard-bee friends and I will be ecstatic! His exasperated family is also A++.

PS: I have read all the short stories and also Martha Wells's Patreon, so feel free to include details from there as well!

A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara 
Jean-Baptiste \"JB\" Marion (A Little Life), Jude St. Francis (A Little Life), Malcolm Irvine (A Little Life), Willem Ragnarsson (A Little Life)

I would like a fix-it fic. Is that bossy? I can't believe that anyone finished this book and didn't want to fix at least some part of it, so. For any part or portion of any of this novel and of Jude St Francis' life: please feel free to pick the characters you most like, I listed the four friends to snag a match. I would be be happy with any way in which you chose to fix-it: are they women and therefore comprehensive psychological care is (almost) normalized? do they live in the future where induced amnesia is a palliative for trauma, yikes? maybe JB comes over one morning with pastries and talks about art with Jude? did Jude decide to stick around with Ana and go to UCSF and never meet Caleb, or anyone at all? (love the friendship vibes, but can you imagine Jude, trying out recovery, meeting Willem in their forties instead of their twenties? It'd be like a Slim Aarons photograph.) Did Malcolm say 'ah, let's build somewhere else' and thus the car accident never happened, and sometimes Willem awakens at night, cold, and wonders who he is? some of these are pretty horrifying as fix-its go, can you believe that Hanya Yanagihara edits the luxury supplement for the New York Times? all those years of writing about artful arrangements and elegant homes, and she just had to break characters who live so graciously. (&lt;3 you Hanya!) (I love her writing but I do think that something could have helped Jude.)

Dublin Murder Squad Series - Tana French 
Mick \"Scorcher\" Kennedy, Richie Curran

justice for this ship, they should've banged even though they ended their careers with the one case they worked together. They should've banged, it would be messy and ugly and hurt. Scorcher is my fave character in the books, and I think his choices are interesting. I am intrigued by the problems of masculinity: which, oh wow, there are so many, let's talk about marriage, responsibility toward ill family members, and guilt. Guilt, oh geez, let's talk about civic religion and who feels guilty about what, back and forth so many times like crosshatching for a scar. Let's talk about how they treat women, and if Scorcher is capable of trusting anyone (in a sexy way? or in an unsexy way. whichever!) I really like reading about miserable weather and Richie's lapses of judgment. I love love reading about garden variety selfishness and thoughtlessness. I don't think anything special needed to happen to ruin them, but that it did makes it all the worse.

The Goldfinch - Donna Tartt 
Kitsey Barbour, Theodore Decker

I like the Barbours, I like the bleakness of Theo's life even after the desert, I would love a story with a strong sense of place. I like the kind of drug and alcohol consumption in canon and don't think there's a problem with Theo making poor choices (two scotches and a pill before bedtime? sure.) I like au's and girl!characters:Theo's slump-hearted misery would be the same in any body. (Theo and Kitsey as women are basically a J.Crew ad for lesbianism.) I would love a story with references to art history and paintings other than the titular bird: surely Kitsey at least went to the Vermeer show at the Met? (I really like Kitsey! water-obsessed and pastelized as she is.) I would prefer a story that dealt with Kitsey and Theo within the canon timeline, when they are both making the best of what they're not quite enough happy with, although Theo doubts his ability to be happy with anything, and Kitsey's successes are hard glossy armor over an aggressive drive to never be caught out, it's not that she enjoys her affair, it's that she feels like running a four minute mile when Theo doesn't ask who's calling her. The inevitable ending doesn't have to be inevitable, either, if you like au's? I love reading about ridiculous New York real estate, Theo and Kitsey having an Instagram-worthy breakfast in bed while he's still hungover and she's lying, yes yes yes.

Dark Matter (TV) 
Three | Marcus Boone, The Android (Dark Matter)

Hello wonderful writer!

I love the weird curiosity/flirtation between The Android and Three. I was pretty much set on them from when Three gets all possessive of The Android and wanting to protect her from being wiped and I was stuck on The Android being flirtatious when she noticed how tight Three's bodysuit was

I'd love to see some awkward Robot flirting and some reciprocating from Three (whether he genuinely wants to admit it, awkwardly backhandedly flirts or feels oodles of guilt over it since she is an Android--and not even a sexbot! is up to you....i will welcome all of it) how far you take this ship is up to you but if you can give me some hilarious flirting i will be MOST HAPPY AND GRATEFUL omg *heart eyes* i also would really dig it if Android almost tricked Three into having sex with her and he kind went with it even if he suspected it to be a lie because he is SO WEIRDLY ATTRACTED TO HER AND HE IS NOT WILLING TO OPENLY ADMIT IT OKAY? wow, honestly all of it would be hilarious and adorable . i'm open to fluff and awkwardness and both of them being bad ass.

Hello lovely writer!

I'd love to read a fic where we learn to what extent Freya has emotionally manipulated Sara. I'd love to read how Freya projects her trauma and suffering onto Sara and to what extent Sara was manipulated and how she began the long road to break free of the toxic relationship with Freya.

I'd love to read a conflicted Sara who is part kind/loving towards Freya and part prisoner/deadly assassin loyal to freya to a fault. Freya who she recognizes as mad with need for revenge and self preservation but who also needs constant support. Is Sara the only one who is allowed to hug Freya? To speak closely without worry of retribution? does Freya dine with Sara and the other chosen warriors? does Sara finding herself devoted and defensive of Freya even though somewhere inside she still knows that she much escape with the others? Is there a toxic physical relationship that fills a need for intimacy between both women? How does her last night before her escape go? I'm just really curious here. I'd love it if it was romantically inclined (consensual, dubcon or noncon) or just platonic/friendship/loyalty  i'd just love to read more about this strange bond they have and how life in Freya's ice palace was for her and Sara

Gladiator (2000) 
Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (Gladiator (2000)), Maximus Decimus Meridius (Gladiator (2000))

Was there anything sadder than all of those longing glances from Lucilla towards Maximus?

Every word spoken between them was a tragedy, a happiness that could never be.

I'd love to read a fic where Maximus is still in Marcus Aurelius' favor as General and he really gets to know Lucilla. I'd love to read about Lucilla being young and confident and throwing herself at him in some very subtle ways that only Maximus would recognize.

Let me read about the love affair and happiness that neither ended up with!

(dearest writer, i'm okay with you foregoing an explanation for maximus' wife, or absence of wife but I'd rather not read about adultery... so if it's from their youthful days let them be flirtatious without hooking up, or if it's canon divergent then anything goes! all i ask is that there is no hate towards his wife/family and that it's all very respectful and he honors his vows --only coming close to being tempted to break them--)  I'm also very very okay with canon divergent where maximus and lucilla somehow make things work, or if you stay true to canon... lucilla uses her private time with maximus for sooooooooooooooooooo much good and that they make the guards jealous *G*

The Borgias (2011) 
Cesare Borgia (The Borgias 2011)

So, like a *lot* of people.. I'm *kinda* in love with Cesare...mostly to the point that I can't even pinpoint what I'd actually like to see out of a fic with him.

    So I've narrowed down that I'd like to read a fic where Cesare can pretty much do anything. He could focus on daddy!issues (he has a lot of them), or love on his sister (emotionally and/or physically...incest? sure!), or fuck married women (or Micheletto!) and I'd be soooooooo good with it... with only one catch, that his tight leather pants are mentioned. (and maybe his gorgeous hair)

    So let me summarize. Cesare + anyone + leather pants= EPIC WIN
**mega bonus points if you mention his beautiful hair***

Omg i'm reusing an old prompt from old YT because every year i put it on here cause I will ALWAYS want more Cesare prancing around in leather pants. But this year i'm thinking.. WHAT IF HE GETS A NEW TAILOR, and the TAILOR WHO MAKES HIS LEATHER PANTS HAS AN APPRENTICE WHO IS WICKED HOT and he MAKES OUT AND SEDUCES HIM IN ORDER TO STEAL LEATHER PANTS INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR THEM (or are they on the house? or is the tailor some sexy old man who gets handsy with Cesare in his leather pants during fittings and micheletto notices and says something? (kinda like on friends when Chandler sends joey to his Tailor and there is CUPPAGE) ahahhaa I don't know but let me tell you I never tire of asking for swaggering Cesare in leather.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Atia of the Julii (Rome 2005)

I recently watched this entire series and was blown away by the depth of Atia's character.

    I would love a fic that strips away the pushy, haughty Patrician Atia, and shows a different side that even she never lets us see on the show. The only time she ever looked vulnerable was when Antony broke her heart. I'd love to read whether she actually did love her husband, did she really love him? Did she love him so deeply and then get betrayed? Was it so bad that she told herself that she'd never be weak and in love ever again, and then Antony happened and despite her best efforts she gave in and loved him.

    I want to read about what makes her happy, truly happy. I want her not to worry about Atia the leader of a very influential household. Not Atia the man-eater.

    She seems so selfish and heartless, but she does feel things... she is a regular person (although she'd never admit it) so I'd love to read about her vulnerable, happy side

    Past!fic or Future!fic is great, i'm pretty much okay with whatever pairing. I'd prefer no incest. A story with any one of her lovers, or her husband would be great. Hopefully I've given you enough guidance/ideas to kinda see what i'm looking for lovely writer, but optional details are optional and i've left this pretty open to interpretation. I'm also good with any rating, I LOVE intimate moments where are personal defenses are down (not necessarily sexual, although that's more than okay) just the honestly and vulnerability of intimacy is awesome to read about.

I'm dying to know how these two met and how Menalippe rose to be her Lieutenant. Is it a physical relationship? or did she cry out from loyalty only? was there an awkward point where they were flirting and then had to ask each other out? did Diana help? or is this from before Diana?

Do they have spa days together when they're taking a break from the military? do they go to Hippolyta's dinner parties together? How do birthdays work?

I'm down for anything and everything. G-NC17, whatever you want to work with i'm good with... but I am soooo interested in the loyalty and love behind that despair and subsequent anger towards Steve Trevor from Menalippe when they are at Steve Trevor's interrogation.

I love this show, and I love all the characters, and I really, really love Janet. She’s so open and honest and she’s got all this backstory and worldbuilding the show hasn’t fully explored yet. I love the position they’ve put her in and the way we’ve gotten to see her change.

I ship Jason/Janet, but I love Janet-focused gen just as much, and I’d be delighted with either. For background ships/characters, I enjoy any combination of Eleanor, Chidi, and Tahani, and I have a soft spot for Vicki, too.

Please see my letter for general likes and more canon-specific information and prompts.

DNW: Dubcon, non-con, fic focusing on explicit porn/kink content, underage, major character death (although temporary MCD or minor character death in service of a casefic are fine), focus on terminal illness, issuefic, cannibalism, harm to pets

Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever (2014) 
Grumpy Cat (Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever)

Grumpy Cat! This movie was way better than it had any right to be. :D I love what Aubrey Plaza did with Grumpy as a character, and I love cats. Anything would be amazing.

Please feel free to go as meta or high-concept (or not) as you want with this one. I’m up for anything from a traditional fluff fic about Grumpy settling in with her new human post-movie to epistolary/Yuletide meta/script format/whatever other unusual format you’re interested in.

Lumberjanes 

I love Lumberjanes! It’s the summer camp version of Gravity Falls I didn’t know I was missing. :D I’d be down with a gift for any of the nominated characters and for any combo of the nominated characters. 

I love fic set at Lumberjanes camp, in the forest etc. around the camp, and in Bear Woman’s weird land-of-the-lost world. Basically anything where the Lumberjanes have to solve some sort of problem, whether that problem is supernatural or totally mundane, would be awesome.

I’m a fan of romance, adventure (especially quests!), casefic, plotty fic, fluff, gen, world-building and character studies. I am happy with any rating and any tone, from fluffy curtain fic down to pretty dark stuff. I usually prefer at least a bittersweet ending, though. I love fics that are realistic and I love stuff that’s tropey as all get out; go wild.

Some themes/tropes I really love include: characters fighting against/changing fate, everything about survival (what it means, how it changes you, the lengths you went to), the pressures and struggles of leadership, two people against the world together, found family anything, harsh/beautiful (or harshly beautiful) physical landscapes, gifts or gestures with intense or very personal meanings, anything where characters just get one another, characters who grapple with becoming evil or doing evil deeds, villains who believe they’re in the right, villains who just don’t care about morality, characters who are determined hope will prevail above all else, characters who really feel the weight of their heritage/someone's legacy and a pressure to live up to that.

I am also okay for you to use one, all, or any combination of the characters I’ve requested in each fandom.

DNWs:

I'm not going to lie, I ship the three of them. I love the fierce idealism of Ptolemy and Kitty, combined with Bartimaeus' cynicism and begrudging affection. I think they'd be great together if, you know, they weren't separated by 2,000 years, a separate dimension, and Ptolemy being dead. If you can finagle a way to write OT3 fic for them, I would be absolutely over the moon.

Other possible ideas: Ptolemy, Kitty, and Bartimaeus meeting in the Other Place, thanks to the mutability of time. Bartimaeus thinking about Ptolemy and Kitty and what it would be like if they met properly. Ptolemy gets resurrected, somehow, and chaos ensues. Alternatively, Kitty travels back in time, somehow, and chaos ensues.

Does the narrator chafe at being Gloria's second-in-command and grab her own turf? How would Gloria's plans for the narrator have played out? What about the arrangement- would anything have changed if Gloria and the narrator stayed together?

Body of Proof 
Megan Hunt (Body of Proof), Kate Murphy

All right, so I ship the hell out of these two and would love just about any fic involving them sharing snarky, flirty banter with each other and relishing being smarter and more fabulous than everyone else.  Smut is welcome, but please don't feel obligated to write it if you don't feel comfortable doing so!

The three major items on my Do Not Want list are rape, abuse (even in hurt/comfort fics), and gore.  I am a big ol' wimp when it comes to gore, and yes, this does sometimes present a few challenges when watching the show itself.  I'm fine with blood, though, so no worries there. 

Smut-wise, while I can definitely see their sex life being a near-constant battle for dominance (albeit with wonderful after-care), I'm not a fan of strap-ons or dildos in general.  Scat, watersports and age-play are also major squicks of mine, and I probably don't need to mention this, but just to be on the safe side (considering the nature of Kate and Megan's work), please avoid necrophilia and necrophilia-related topics.  I'd consider it a personal favor.  Also, please don't kill either of them.  My fragile little heart just couldn't take it.  

Apart from all that, whether you have them solving a case together, indulging in some hurt/comfort (goodness knows they both have more than enough past trauma to work with), figuring out how to navigate their somewhat rocky relationships with Megan's daughter and/or mother, arguing and then really enjoying the making-up process, or hell, even competing to see who can make Ethan the most uncomfortable, or just about any other scenario you feel like putting them in, as long as Kate and Megan are being snarky and fabulous, I'm probably going to be happy.

Jem and the Holograms (Comics) 
Mary \"Stormer\" Phillips (Jem Comics), Roxanne \"Roxy\" Pellegrini (Jem Comics), Phyllis \"Pizzazz\" Gabor (Jem Comics), Sheila \"Jetta\" Burns (Jem Comics)

Whether we're talking about the show or the comics, in my opinion the Misfits are the best part of Jem and the Holograms.  Their songs ARE better, after all.  Anyway, I'd love a fic that was just about the Misfits being their fabulously tacky and bratty selves.  Bonus points for wacky antics, especially the kind that, logically, they probably ought to be arrested for, although since when have Misfits had any use for logic (apart from Stormer, sometimes)?  Even more bonus points for femmeslash.  My favorite pairings are Kimber/Stormer and Pizzazz/Roxy, but feel free to mix it up a bit!  Go wild!  Smut is welcome, but I won't be disappointed if you'd rather not go there.

Again, I'm not a fan of rape, abuse, gore, scat/watersports, ageplay or strap-ons/dildos.  And as far as this fandom goes, I'm not super interested in \"serious\" topics at all.  The Misfits are far too busy being flawless, gorgeous and magnificent to worry about silly things like consequences, propriety, introspection and emotional maturity.  The bottom line is, I want you to enjoy writing this as much as possible, dear author!   The more fun you have writing this story, the more fun I'm probably gonna have reading it.

If you want to write smut, I certainly won't object as long as they're both legal, consenting adults when it takes place.  Hurt/comfort would be awesome ('cause let's face it, they've both got ISSUES), team-ups with the rest of Mystery Incorporated would be fantastic, and you can never go wrong with a Vincent Van Ghoul and/or Professor Hatecraft and/or Hex Girls cameo.  Again, the more fun you have writing this fic, the more likely I am to love the hell out of it!

Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Kalr Five | Ettan, Medic (Mercy of Kalr), Athoek Station, Lieutenant Tisarwat

I adore almost everything about these books, but there’s a special place in my heart for Kalr Five, Tisarwat, Medic and Athoek Station. I would love to read something about any combination of them working together to achieve something unlikely to be fatal – say, preparations for the Conclave? Or a dinner party (Kalr Five’s dedication to propriety in the matter of tea sets is always delightful)? Or something to do with restoring those gardens on the Station, or the improvements to the Undergarden (beset-but-competent administrator Tisarwat is probably my favourite Tisarwat)…

Alternatively, things have gone wrong already and now Medic is having a very, very bad day with some very, very bad patients. Because they’d definitely be bad patients, in their own ways.

Points - Melissa Scott & Lisa A. Barnett 
Philip Eslingen, Nicolas Rathe, Istre b'Estorr

This series is one of my favourite examples of worldbuilding in current fantasy, so I’d love something that branches out and explores the world beyond what we’ve seen already in the books. I like Eslingen, Rathe and b’Estorr, but Eslingen most of all, and I’m really interested in his soldiering past and how he started to move back toward that, in a different way, in Fair’s Point, so anything that deals with the City Guard and his role in shaping it/deciding how it operates would be wonderful, especially if it involves conflict with the Points, and/or that King of Thieves (horses with personality = love). Casefic would be *adored*.

Call the Midwife 
Julienne (Call the Midwife), Evangelina (Call the Midwife), Phyllis Crane, Barbara Gilbert

If there’s one thing I love about *Call the Midwife* more than anything else, it’s Phyllis Crane’s friendship with Barbara Gilbert, and how it so often reverses roles, with Phyllis the apparently plain, stodgy, moralistic older woman surprising sparky-but-conventional young thing Barbara with her past and flexible viewpoints (and Phyllis as Barbara’s bridesmaid was an absolute delight!). They have a great working dynamic, and I’d love to see them working together on something like a public health issue, either before Barbara’s marriage or after it. And maybe, for a change, Barbara cna surprise Phyllis. :)

I also love both Sister Evangelina and Sister Julienne, and find the contrast between Sister Julienne’s serenity and her difficulty with accepting change very interesting; I suspect that one of the reasons Julienne and Evangalina didn’t butt heads as often as they might have was because Evangelia shared that conservatism, so anything about how their relationships works—and the moments when it doesn’t work—or how the arrival of someone like Phyllis or Barbara challenges one or both of them would be lovely.

I know it’s weird having ‘no birth scenes’ in my DNWs for a show about midwives, but we get enough of those in the show itself, so medical casefic that’s not about birth is what I would prefer if casefic takes your fancy here.

DNWs: any explicit sexual content, any explicit romantic content, blood, gore and injury beyond what’s in canon (but no uterine inversions please! I can’t cope with that again…), birth scenes, major character deaths outside of what’s canon.

Humans (TV) 
Mattie Hawkins, Odi (Humans), Niska (Humans)

I love this show so much, but never even thought about fic for it until I saw it in the tagset and had a brainwave. One of my favourite plot strands in season 2 was Mattie trying to restore Odi, and his struggle to deal with consciousness. I’d love to see something about the longer-term impact of his ‘suicide’ on her, and how it affects her relationships with the conscious Synths. Or, did the code push reawaken Odi? If it did, how does he react? Would he come to Mattie for help, or strike out on his own? What would happen if he crossed paths with Niska?

Or Mattie and Niska each figuring out what to do next in the aftermath of the Synth Awakening would be interesting too—there are a lot of parallels between them that I'd love to see explored.

Count Dracula (TV 1977) 
Renfield (Count Dracula 1977), Mina Westenra Harker (Count Dracula 1977), Dracula (Count Dracula 1977), Jonathan Harker (Count Dracula 1977)

What if Renfield did as Dracula wanted? What if he hadn’t tried to warn Seward and instead did as Dracula expected and drank from an “initiated human”—meaning Mina, somehow, while Jonathan and Seward were in shouting distance? Mina might do likewise, being in Dracula’s power at that moment from all that was implied. Or maybe it’s her choice. How would this work without drawing attention, and how would the men not notice?

Does Jonathan notice anything odd about her at all later? Does Dracula encourage Mina to “initiate” Jonathan, turning him and also providing Dracula’s own blood to do so faster? And if he was turned, what would the four of them (since Renfield’s bound to get out of that cell even if they don’t come for him; seriously, the guy’s fantastic at that, so he’s right behind them eventually) manage to do before they were found out? Does Seward or anybody else ever notice a change in Renfield before an impromptu escape? What happens in the aftermath?

What if the Innkeeper’s Wife at the Golden Krone saw everyone on their way through Transylvania to destroy Dracula? What if everyone stopped at that hotel, since Jonathan knew it was hopefully safe? Would Jonathan try to confide in her his fears, despite the occasional language barrier? Would he—hoping she didn’t understand—even confide he was willing to follow Mina, and become a vampire if it did come to that?

Dracula (TV 1968) 

What if Dracula chose to target Jonathan to fulfill his promise after he successfully turned Lucy, instead of going after Mina by way of Lucy? Would Lucy try to tempt Seward instead, to lure him away from the cell so that Dracula could go to Jonathan? What happens if Van Helsing is there, too, and drives her off? Are they able to reach anything of his old self, to appeal to what’s left of it, or does Jonathan run into Dracula’s arms? Does he escape first, so that they can get him bitten in the privacy of the graveyard? If Lucy never revealed herself to Mina in this version, it would be nice if she still figured out the existence of vampires and tried to fight for Jonathan’s soul.

Horror of Dracula (1958) 
Jonathan Harker (Horror of Dracula 1958), Count Dracula (Horror of Dracula 1958), Arthur Holmwood (Horror of Dracula 1958), Abraham Van Helsing (Horror of Dracula 1958)

Does Dracula stay as Jonathan changes? Did Jonathan rip the room apart in a feral state, or was it just the last shred of lingering humanity that was horrified at what he had become? Or did Dracula make that mess which Van Helsing found? Did Jonathan have time to go hunting for fresh blood with Dracula before Van Helsing killed him? After a quick search around online, I see it was about 10 days for Jonathan to be a vampire. What was he like as a brand new vampire? We only see him sleeping in his coffin before he was staked. Did he actually bother to organize the books when Dracula left him alone, in between whatever else he did as a new vampire? While I’m joking about the last, I can sort of picture Jonathan trying to fix up the library.

What if Jonathan woke fully before he was staked by Van Helsing, and tried to fight back? Is there anything left of his personality to trick Van Helsing with, or is he just starving for the nearest source of blood? Or what if Jonathan traveled with Dracula, and targeted (per Dracula’s orders) Arthur while Dracula went after others? Arthur could barely handle seeing a staking of a vampire. How would he handle seeing Jonathan as one of the undead? And would he be the one forced to stake him? Or would he be bitten by him?

The Persuaders 
Brett Sinclair, Danny Wilde, Prue (The Persuaders)

I love Prue and Brett's relationship, especially the moment in 'That's Me Over There' when Brett sees her car coming and smiles smugly to himself because he knows exactly what's going to happen next. I really enjoy Prue's arch, playful way of dealing with Brett in both her episodes; it seems to me that she has the measure of him pretty well and knows exactly what she wants from him and how she plans to get it, and I'm sure it wouldn't take her too long to size up Danny in a similar way. I'm also intrigued by the possibilities of Brett and Danny interacting with a woman together when at least one of them really knows her, as that doesn't happen much on the show.

I'd really like a fic in which Brett and Prue are good friends who understand each other, and then use that understanding to run rings around Danny. I'd be equally happy with gen (casefic or just the three of them hanging out equally welcome), het or slash; I'd also love it if you went the threesome route. (My specific bunny for that is that Danny has been pestering Brett to have a threesome with him for ages, and Brett finally says 'OK, but I get to pick the woman' and asks Prue because he knows that together they'll be able to run the show. No preference as to whether this is in the context of an established Brett/Danny relationship or not.) Anything with the three of them interacting in a fun, playful way would make me happy, regardless of the pairing(s) or rating.

The Limehouse Golem (2016) 
George Flood (The Limehouse Golem (2016)), John Kildare (The Limehouse Golem (2016))

I really loved the spiky, respectful and layered relationship that the film built for these two.  How Flood looks up to Kildare and identifies with him, but at the same time really doesn't want to be where he is in twenty years, and how Kildare mentors Flood and expects the best out of him and *totally misses* all that respect and identification unless it's thrown in his face.

I'd love something that develops that relationship after the film ends.  I can absolutely see this as a potential romance, especially a slow and hesitant one.  I can equally see it as a deepening friendship (something Kildare seems terribly short of).  I would adore casefic if that's your thing.  Anything that builds on what the movie gave me with these two would make me happy.

I’ve shipped Cal/Nikko since 2003. I’m very loyal to my tiny rarepairs, what can I say.

They’re both so jealous of each other for basically the same reason, and the fact that neither of them can see that makes me want to smack their heads together. I mean the Daddy Issues, come on. 

They’re both kind of brats, but they manage to overcome that when it counts and work together, so if you felt like doing something with that dynamic I’d love it. I love the Found Family aspects of the show, too. Nikko's Two Dads, Calvin's jealousy of Nikko and Solomon's relationship, the weird sibling rivalry Nikko and Cal have going...I love all of it.

モンスター娘のいる日常 | Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou

Centorea is my favorite character in this series. I love how she maintains her sense of honor despite all the comedic hijinks, and how even though she's lost fights to various enemies she keeps on trying to battle for the people she cares about. So anything focusing on any of those aspects of her--e.g., her honor, her zeal to battle for good, her devotion to Kimihito and how her honor inspires her to fight for him--would be awesome.

Other characters from this manga I really like are Polt (the gym kobold; she's written with wonderful pep in the series, and I like the core concept of a monster having a relatively mundane job and making it awesome) and Ils Nineta (the prank-loving shrine maiden fox spirit, for similar reasons). But Centorea is my favorite, so basically anything with her, I'm happy. :-)

DC Super Hero Girls (Web Series) 
Komand'r (DC Super Hero Girls), Koriand'r (DC Super Hero Girls)

I really like the duo of Starfire and Blackfire, and have since the old Teen Titans show. In this series of course they have a much less antagonistic relationship, and I love the idea of exploring that relationship in more detail. There are so many questions to explore. A few possibilities: 

* Do they hang out together when they're both back on their home planet? 

* How would they come to each other's defense if one of them got attacked by something she couldn't handle on her own? 

* If Starfire spent a day on Korugar, how would that go differently than the day Blackfire spent on Earth? 

* Is Blackfire doing full-on supervillainy yet, and if so, how would Starfire deal with it--or if Starfire tried to do superheroics against some major monster she's not strong enough to take on, how (if at all) would Blackfire try to talk her down? 

A story exploring any of these questions (or any similar themes) would be totally awesome.

Other characters from this show I really like are the Big Barda/Lady Shiva pair (I'm a sucker for redemption arcs) and Batgirl (I'm also a sucker for non-powered heroes competing at the same level as heroes with all kinds of powers). Honestly, though, I'll like just about anything with Starfire and Blackfire in it.

As long as the story is canon-style (I’m not really into “Shelagh is a barista/astronaut/zombie/etc.”), if you have an idea of your own, or one based on one of my general likes (see my letter), I’m sure I will like it.

My main interests in this fandom are Bernadette | Shelagh &amp; Julienne, Phyllis, Phyllis &amp; Delia, Phyllis &amp; Barbara, and Delia/Patsy. I also love Sister Evangelina, although I didn’t have room to request her, so if you have a plotbunny about her, I’d be happy to read about her too. 

<i>Bernadette | Shelagh &amp; Julienne</i>
I love the mother-daughter relationship between them. It’s one of my favorite parts of the series, as Julienne watches Bernadette become Shelagh, and their relationship changes and grows over the years. When Shelagh asked Julienne to deliver her baby, and they went through her labour together, I cried, literally cried. It was so beautiful. Anything about the two of them would be wonderful. Is it hard for Julienne to watch Bernadette forsake her vows? What are her prayers for Shelagh over the years (is Shelagh’s baby an answer to them?) Does Shelagh ever miss being Bernadette, and the life she led with Julienne and the other Sisters? How did they meet for the first time? Did Bernadette or Shelagh ever comfort Julienne after a difficult day? What does Julienne miss most about Shelagh (or vice versa)?

<i>Phyllis</i>
Phyllis is probably my favourite character on the show. I love her empathy, her kindness, and her heart of gold. Anything from her POV, whether that be a character study, a day in her life at Nonnatus, her thoughts on her fellow midwives (or her patients), a glimpse into her backstory, or a canon-style midwifery case, would be wonderful. I would also enjoy a f/f romance for Phyllis with an OFC.

<i>Phyllis &amp; Delia</i>
The bit in the show where Phyllis saw Delia &amp; Patsy together and realised their secret, and then later consoled Delia with her book of poetry, really spoke to me. I would enjoy a story from Phyllis’s POV about Delia &amp; Patsy’s romance, or a story in which Phyllis and Delia talked about it (either explicitly or obliquely). I think it would be great for Delia and Patsy to have someone on their side who they didn’t have to hide their relationship from. Or I’d also love a story where Phyllis &amp; Delia became better friends (perhaps they work on a difficult case together?)

<i>Phyllis &amp; Barbara</i>
Barbara asking Phyllis to be her bridesmaid was just so lovely. It meant so much to Phyllis to be asked, and the two of them were so cute together. Like with Delia, I’d love any story with Phyllis &amp; Barbara bonding and becoming closer, whether before Tom proposed, during the wedding preparations, or after the wedding. Whether that bonding takes place during a case they share, at the clinic, or on a quiet evening at Nonnatus House, I’d enjoy it all. I’d also enjoy a futurefic in which Phyllis is Barbara’s midwife during her first pregnancy. (Though I know Barbara has no immediate plans for that!) [Oh, one note – while I don’t dislike Tom, I’d prefer his presence to be minimal, as I’m mostly interested in Phyllis &amp; Barbara.]

<i>Delia/Patsy</i>
For Delia/Patsy, I have one main request: I want them to get that flat together! They deserve a place of their own where they can be happily domestic and in love and have hot morning sex before work/drink tea together at night/argue about whose turn it is to wash the dishes/etc. Does Patsy help Delia with her midwife studies? (How might she encourage her?) Does Delia eventually become a midwife and they end up working together? (Either in general or on a specific case?) A story about a day off they spend together, whether they stay at home or go out on the town, would be lovely too.

Jackalope Wives Series - Ursula Vernon 
Grandma Harken (Jackalope Wives)

This series may just be my favourite thing I’ve read in all of 2017. Both stories are fantastic. I love Vernon’s worldbuilding, and her prose, and her fantastically rich characters (especially Grandma Harken, of course!) She’s one of my favourite authors, and the Jackalope Wives series might just be my favourite of her works. (Although it’s extremely hard to choose.)

Grandma Harken is a wonderful character, and I would adore pretty much any story about her and her adventures. There’s a history and affection between her and the Father of Rabbits – perhaps something about the two of them! (Was/is the Father of Rabbits in love with her? Were they friends? Allies?) What if the Father of Rabbits hadn’t been able to save Grandma Harken’s jackalope skin, and the jackalope wife had been stuck as a human? What might their relationship have been like? And did Grandma Harken’s first husband die a natural death, or did Grandma Harken have something to do with it? (Or the Father of Rabbits?)

I also love Spook-cat, and Eva (what’s it like to have a mother who’s a jackalope wife?), and polite Tomas with his polite mule. As for Anna, I do ship Grandma Harken/Anna, if that interests you, but I’m also interested in their friendship if you’re a gen person. All the worldbuilding about the train gods is fascinating, and I’d love to see more about that. Or about how Anna, the Mother of Trains, sees Grandma Harken, the jackalope wife. There’s a lot of respect there, mixed in with their friendship. I like how they consulted on the Marguerite problem and pooled their knowledge (over ripe tomatoes, of course).

As for the cholla-bone girl, what would it be like to have Grandma Harken as your teacher? The line about the cholla-bone girl being “more like Grandma Harken than either of them were like fully human folk” – what’s it like for the cholla-bone girl, raised among the priests of the trains, to come to Grandma Harken and find someone like her? What does Grandma Harken teach her? What sort of adventures does she have? (If the Father of Rabbits hadn’t had Grandma Harken’s skin, and the jackalope wife had stayed human and stayed with Grandma Harken, might she have fallen in love with the cholla-bone girl? What sort of life might they have forged together, preparing to take over for Grandma Harken when the desert reclaimed her?)

Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers 
Gerald Wimsey Viscount St George (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers)

I’ve always loved St George. He’s irrepressible and reckless, but he has a good heart. I find it a bit curious that his parents are Denver and Helen – he doesn’t seem to take after them much. No, who he resembles the most to me is a young male version of the Dowager Duchess! Crossed with a bit of Peter, since Peter has done his best to exert some influence on him. 

Some ideas:

- St George gets involved somehow in a murder. (Is he in the wrong place at the wrong time? Romancing a young man in another college whose roommate ends up murdered? Accused of being an accessory after evidence is found hidden in his room?) Either he tries to solve it on his own first or calls in the cavalry immediately, but the ultimate upshot is that Peter and/or Harriet and/or Bunter arrive and they work it out together.
- St George falls in love with Jones of Jesus! Who in St George’s family is the first to figure out that the ‘friend’ Jerry brought back from Oxford is a bit more than a friend? (I’d love it if Peter wasn’t the first to notice.) [As I said in my general section, please don’t have any sympathetic characters be intolerant.]
- St George being an uncle to Bredon. What kind of influence is he? What kind of things do they get up to together?
- St George and his grandmother bonding. What adventures do they have together? Does either of them have any skill at detecting? (I think the Dowager does, at any rate, given her record in Clouds of Witness with Mary's charade.)

I’ve heard that Sayers said St George died in WWII, but I, unlike Sayers, don’t have a fascination with Peter becoming Duke of Denver, and I would very much like St George to stay alive. So please don’t kill him off. I also have no interest in St George having a het relationship.

Frederica - Georgette Heyer 
Frederica Merriville, Vernon Dauntry Marquis of Alverstoke

I’m more than a little in love with Frederica. She may just be my favourite Heyer heroine (though I’d need to re-read all the books to confirm, as I like a lot of them). I adore how she’s so focused on her younger siblings, that love comes as an unlooked-for surprise. And Alverstoke! I love his character development over the course of the book – he starts as a total prick who only cares about himself and can’t even remember his nieces and nephews’ names, and then he slowly becomes more and more charmed by the Merriville family, until by the end he’s eating out of their hands. (Though he’s still a bit of a prick to other people, just not to them, which feels realistic and amuses me.) I like how his worst problem is that he’s bored and selfish, and that he falls in love not only with Frederica (though their romance is lovely), but with her entire family. 

Some of the things I’d love to read about for this book:
- Heyer books always end too abruptly! What happened after Alverstoke’s proposal? What is life like during their engagement, as Jessamy and Felix’s adventures continue to roil the household and keep it interesting, but there are more Alverstoke/Frederica stolen kisses and speaking looks? What is their honeymoon like?
- Something happens and Charis is afraid that her wedding will have to be called off! How do Frederica and Alverstoke come to the rescue?
- How do Frederica and Alverstoke help Charles and Chloë’s romance succeed? It’s not a great alliance for Chloë (unless Charles does make it big in politics), so there might be some difficulties that need to be overcome.
- Alverstoke gets in a pickle, and this time it’s the Merrivilles who have to help/rescue him. (Set anytime during the book or after.)
- Alverstoke acts like a prick to someone, and he’s a bit worried he’s going to be scolded, but it turns out Frederica doesn’t mind at all.
- - Like I mentioned in my general likes (see my letter), I’d enjoy crossovers as well. Which other Heyer heroine might Frederica fall in love with? (I’ve read and enjoyed all the Regency novels except for the Alastair-Audley series, so any of the non-AA heroines are fair game!) For crossover pairings, I am only interested in femslash.

The Grand Sophy - Georgette Heyer 
Sophy Stanton-Lacy, Charles Rivenhall

Sophy is another fantastic Heyer character. I came out of <i>The Grand Sophy</i> wanting a few specific things:

- What were Sophy’s adventures like before coming to England? How did she become the Sophy who turned the Rivenhall household upside down?
- What does Sophy see in Charles? I’m not dissing him, I just mean that we don’t get to see things from her POV. What attracts her to him? When does she start to fall in love with him? How far in advance does she lay her plans? Does she ever worry that any of her plans won’t succeed?
- I would definitely be interested in Sophy overcoming Charles’s stern-ish exterior and them having all the cuddles and horse-races and flirtatious competitions.
- In general, I would love to see more of Sophy’s POV on things! She’s quite awe-inspiring beheld from the outside, but I’d love to get inside her head more.
- Further adventures with Sophy and/or Charles!
- Like I mentioned up in my general prompts, I’d enjoy crossovers as well. Which other Heyer heroine might Sophy fall in love with? (I’ve read and enjoyed all the Regency novels except for the Alastair-Audley series, so any of the non-AA heroines are fair game!) For crossover pairings, I am only interested in femslash.

Sylvester or the Wicked Uncle - Georgette Heyer 
Phoebe Marlow

I love this book! The capers in France are a bit too drawn-out for my tastes, but apart from that I really enjoy the characters and their adventures. Edmund is a delight (child characters can sometimes be wearingly precocious, but I think Edmund is pitched just right), and Phoebe is amazing. I love her poison pen and her skill at lampooning the ton. To have a runaway bestseller on your very first try! Well done, Phoebe.

Things I would love for <i>Sylvester</i>:
- Phoebe and Sylvester’s mother Elizabeth bonding over their literary skill. (The book mentions that Elizabeth has had multiple books of poetry published herself.) What does Elizabeth think of Phoebe’s effort, beyond the portrayal of her son? Does she have any ideas about what Phoebe might try to write next? (Because I definitely don’t want Phoebe to give up her writing upon marriage.)
- What does Elizabeth think of Phoebe more generally? She was quite worried at the beginning of the book about the way her son had developed – what does she think of him now, after Phoebe’s influence has changed him? How do she and Phoebe bond after Phoebe and Sylvester’s marriage?
- Lady Constance is such an evil stepmother. She makes me boil. I would love to see how a more confident Phoebe might handle her former tormentor once engaged or married to Sylvester. Does Phoebe put her into one of her books as the primary villain? Say something cutting that only Sylvester fully understands?
- Any adventures with Edmund and Phoebe (and Sylvester if you want). I love the two of them together.
- While I do ship Phoebe/Sylvester, I found the proposal, journey, and second proposal unsatisfying. Perhaps an AU where Tom doesn’t walk in on them during the first proposal, and during the rest of the uninterrupted fight Phoebe realises that he actually loves her? (Although I don’t like the trope of ‘man forcibly kisses woman and she likes it’, so please avoid that.) Or perhaps Sylvester respects her no and doesn’t push her, and when they get back to England Phoebe sets up house with her governess and writes her next novel, and only after that does Sylvester reappear in her life. (Maybe something in her second novel makes him think his cause is not entirely lost?)
- Like I mentioned in my other Heyer sections, I would also love a crossover between <i>Sylvester</i> and one of Heyer’s other books (any of the Regency novels except the Alastair-Audley series), in which Phoebe fell in love with one of Heyer’s other heroines. Which of them would she be particularly suited to? How might they meet, and what adventures might they have?

The Bold Type 
Jacqueline Carlyle, Jane Sloan, Kat Edison, Sutton Brady

No need to include all characters, you can write about one or more as you see fit!

One of my favourite things about the series is the absence of the usual backstabbing and rivalry that often infests anything with friendships between multiple main female characters, especially if it's set in a workplace, and even more so if one of them is the boss. It's very refreshing, and honestly I can't get enough of that. I'd prefer any relationships (I love Adena too) to take second place to that, though it's absolutely welcome.

That doesn't mean it needs to be just like an episode, of course. Throw them in the deep end of something, have a disaster (or a mini-disaster) happen, let zombies invade, aliens take over, pink unicorns run rampant... crossover, dream or something more realistic, I don't mind. Just let the characters do what they would do and I'll be happy :)

These are my go-to shows for when I want to watch people being enthusiastic and/or competent. I love them all in different ways. I 've been trying to figure out which one is my favourite but it turns out the answer is aaall of them, although I may have an extra soft spot for Tales from the Green Valley because that was the first one I saw. I really couldn't choose a favourite of Alex, Peter or Ruth either, because all three of them are The Best Ever for different reasons. I love their enthusiasm and their thirst for knowledge, and the way Alex pronounces words, and Peter's fondness for pigs and Ruth making happy noises when she gets new kitchen appliances. And I love the way they squee about ancient things but never forget to point out that this doesn't necessarily mean they would want to go back and live there (especially Ruth).

Please note that I don't in any way dislike Tom or the Wartime Farm dog, I just felt it would be unfair to ask for Any and then play favourites, so to speak. If the fic of your heart is centred around Tom or the dog, with any combination of Ruth, Peter and/or Alex in the background, I would be most interested to read it! Please feel free not to include all of my requested characters here :)

Because of the way the series work, I would especially like to point out that I'm equally happy with fic about the makings of the programmes, and fic set in a historical AU where they actually work on a farm. Any era is fine (including historical eras not shown in the series), and any combination of characters - I love everyone and everything and if you want to write slash or het I'm all for it, likewise if you want to write them being really good friends, or just being enthusiastic and/or competent on their own.

In general, I like the way Cadfael and Hugh work together to get around the constraint laid on them by loyalties and such. Even better if they have to ask for help from Sister Magdalen and/or Aline because the case involves either of them. Maybe Sister Magdalen has to figure out what to do on her own? Or you could put some/all of the nominated characters in the background and write about other people in the same universe, with or without murder cases to solve.

If there's one thing I especially like about the books, it's the friendships in them. I love that they aren't just stories about murders and civil war and being divided by loyalties and young people in love, but that in the background people keep living their lives, tending their gardens and (often) trusting each other and (mostly) keeping each other's secrets. However, if you prefer to write about love and murder and loyalty and war, please go ahead!

I love this clever little show and everyone in it. I am all caught up and will be staying caught up as this season goes on, so feel free to use current canon as it develops. These two slowly and begrudgingly semi gaining respect for each other was one of my favorite things about season one, along with Eleanor's clear attraction. When she said, \"sidenote, I might legit be into Tahani,\" reader, I died and I think I might need 50k about them dealing with that and also making out in between teasing Chidi and trying to deal with being in The Bad Place. WHAT HAPPENED DURING ATTEMPT NUMBER 218? I adore the execution of this show so far, and I really love the core four and Janet, so feel free to include any and all of them as you wish.

Jules Thomas, Ophelia Mayer

This show was taken from us too fucking soon. I am so, so sad about it still. I really loved Jules and Ophelia's relationship and the development over the course of the season, and I would LOVE to have it been taken even further. Romantic or platonic, I am 100% HERE FOR IT. I also ADORE Kennedy and her relationship with Jules, and Harris and his relationship with Ophelia. I would love to see the four of them interacting if your heart so desires.

Killjoys (TV) 
Dutch (Killjoys), Aneela (Killjoys), Delle Seyah Kendry

I asked for all three of them because I HAVE SUCH A BURNING DESIRE TO SEE THEM INTERACT TOGETHER. Dutch interacting with other women in general is my favorite thing, and I've always adored her scenes with Delle Seyah, and then SURPRISE Aneela and Delle Seyah happened, and I did not think that I was going to go so hard for murder space girlfriends, but I should have known better, because that is absolutely my thing. If you are more interested in writing Aneela/Delle, that's fine, and i'm TOTALLY HAPPY to read about them and their soon to be murder baby, it's just that Dutch is my fav, and I think her relationship with Aneela is SO INTERESTING especially with the events of the season three finale!! I also ADORE Dutch and Johnny's friendship, and don't hate Ducth/D'av, and love the addition of Zeph, so, any and all combinations of that you would like to add, go wild.

Sleeping Beauty (1959) 
Aurora (Sleeping Beauty (1959))

If you're writing in this fandom, I'd love to read a story that gives us a little more insight into Aurora as a person, not just the catalyst for all the events of the movie.  In particular, I've always thought that it's SUPER WEIRD that she runs up and hugs her mother at the end of the movie, given that she'd have no clue who her mother even was.  And assuming that she marries Phillip fairly soon, she will probably never have a parent-child relationship with her actual parents -- so I think it would be interesting to know how she feels about any or all of those people, including the three good fairies.

Or write about Llewyn and the cat! Or Llewyn and Al! Slice of life fic would be nice also, how Llewyn gets by in the day to day, or anything exploring Llewyn's relationship with his art. I greatly appreciate the darkly humorous, melancholy tone of the film so would be in awe of replication of that feel.

Possession - A. S. Byatt 

Possession unites two things I love for quite different reasons: academics doing what they love, and Victorian poets. I really enjoy Byatt's intelligence and attention to detail, and the way she can make postmodern comments about literature without making you take her characters less seriously.
I'd really enjoy a story about Maud: how does her discovery work out for her? She'll have to deal with classes full of students who saw her on television once, and the other dubious rewards of academic fame.
But I'd also enjoy a story about Christabel, Randolph and/or Ellen, if that's something you'd rather write. Again, I'm curious about their later lives. How did they feel, and what did they write about, when it was all over?

Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF 

If you didn't match on this, it's worth reading about--- the Wikipedia article is pretty good. Long story short, it's that time when two teenage girls messing around with a camera convinced the world's foremost author of detective stories that there were real living fairies living in their back yard. The girls didn't actually admit to faking the pictures until the 1980s.
I'm not looking for a story about real living fairies... I've read plenty of those. I'm looking for a story about the kind of silliness that seems to embody the spirit of its age. Or, if you prefer a darker perspective, the kind of prank that's unexpectedly difficult to let go of. Feel free to write about the events of the hoax itself, or look at the girls long after their 15 minutes of fame have lapsed.

Thelma and Louise (1991) 
Louise Sawyer, Thelma Dickinson

What I most love about this movie is the discovery of self and the way the whole world looks different when someone can show you the way. I loved these two wild women letting loose. I love road stories, and the way a person's road - or travelling - self can be someone quite different to the everyday. 

I don't particularly ship them, but please do feel free to write anything from gen to one sided pining to Thelma's Lesbian Awakening to \"Thelma keeps picking up guys what is my life\". 

Prompts:
Between the worlds: I have this great wish for post-canon. Thelma and Louise: Avenging Road Ghosts. Or road tripping ghosts, the avenging's not necessary. I'd just love to see them carrying on, in their joyful way. Maybe, in a place like their canyon, the willing sacrifice of two lives in the name of freedom opens some doors. And now people see a ghost car and two laughing women, and female travelers know that if they see a green Thunderbird, any man tries to mess with them is in trouble. 

Life colliding with the new: If they had made it back to their everyday lives, what might have changed? Anything? Everything? 

Into the sunset: And if they'd made it to Mexico? Then what? 

Outside observer: In-movie, one of them reflecting on the other, or Hal's observations of them. 

General DNW: Non-con, dub-con, incest, any kind of explicit or implied sexual relationship between an adult and child or teenager - or in a mentor/student relationship, humiliation in any context (including awkward sex), infidelity, deathfic, pregnancy, kidfic, animal harm, eye injury, Trump in any form. And a cephalopod (squid, octopus) phobia, um. Although tentaclefic is fine, so long as there is no actual cephalopod, go figure.

Tell me about Rose, or anyone else you care to. Worldbuilding, if you like. 

I'm sorry this is so brief - I haven't read this in a long time, and am waiting for a copy to reread, or I would be more interesting in my prompts. I loved the world so very, very much - it has the coolest magic system I think I might ever have seen. 

What's it like to fall toward the ghostside?

And a cephalopod (squid, octopus) phobia, um. Although tentaclefic is fine, so long as there is no actual cephalopod, go figure.

The Wood Wife - Terri Windling 

This book. *This book*. I love it so much. I love that it's about an artist and her relationship and struggle with her art. I love, so much, that it's about personification of place and the magic in nature. I love that all the spirit creatures are dual-natured and might be helpful or hurtful. It is just so great, this book. You can write about anything at all, including characters not nominated, and I'll be so happy. (I'd prefer gen or non-explicit fic for this particular fandom.)

Ideas: Maggie, getting her poetry back. Does she go back to Cooper's house? Does she stay with Fox? What does her future relationship with the spirit creatures look like? I'd be really interested to read about Anna Neverra's early adventures with the mountains, if you're so inclined. (Though please note my Do Not Wants below if you tackle Anna.)  Dora: Does she start making time for her own art? What does a 'day in the life' working at the bookshop look like? I'm interested in Dora's own creative life and her friendship with Maggie. Crow: Trickster stories are the best. Anything with Crow is great.

Cass Neary Series - Elizabeth Hand 
Cass Neary

This series is very nearly perfection to me. The cheerful grimdarkness of it, the macabre and the strange, and the art, always the art. I don't - like - Cass exactly, but I do love her as a character. Her nihilism, her indestructibility, her unrelenting drive. Her cheerful amoral nature and her moments of kindness. 

So I'd like to know more about her and her world. I've read all three currently available books (Generation Loss, Available Dark, Hard Light) and would enjoy fic set it any of them, or backstory, or futurefic. 

Prompts:
Cass learning to use digital cameras - what might that change for her? Does it change what she sees? What she can or tries to capture?

Casefic! She fell into a mystery again. There are probably ghosts. 

Outside observer - maybe a stranger, maybe someone she knows. 

Dreams realised, or maybe not - Cass gets to exhibit later works, and/or put out a new book. What is the subject matter and how does it go for her?

These things don't fade away - Dealing with fallout from any of her previous adventures, particularly the supernatural kind. 

Or anything at all!

The Magnus Archives (Podcast) 
Jonathan Sims

This show! So great! I really enjoy the statements, and my favourites are the war ghosts. All time favourite is Episode 7: The Piper, all time creeped the hell out is Episode 65: Binary. The various powers and their manifestations are fascinating, and I really like the exploration of what they are, what they aren't, and how they interact with the world. The insect-based powers aren't as interesting to me as the more abstract ones. 

I've requested Jon, but if you'd like to work with other characters as well please do! I love Basira and Daisy and Melanie, I like Martin, Tim and Sasha, and am intrigued by Michael. Not terribly interested in Elias, and prefer not to focus on Not-Sasha. Gertrude is really interesting and I'd love to see her and Jon interact, somehow. 

Prompts:
I am low-key shipping Jon with Melanie King. I would love to read about them working on a case together, maybe post season two, or maybe as a side case just before. I'm a sucker for snarking between working partners, and if that leads you to shipfic that's great, but gen is just fine with me too. Maybe Jon feels the need to head overseas as well after Melanie. I'd like to see her field experience and his knowledge working together. 

Jon finds a way to talk to Gertrude. Or, more likely, Gertrude finds a way to talk to Jon. What does she know about the nature of the Archive and the role of Archivist?

What does it mean to be away from the Archive? Entities keep saying that Jon isn't protected outside the Archive - what does that mean? The title of Archivist seems to mean something to the various powers ... what?

Basira or Daisy is in trouble, and Jon is roped in to help, outside the Archive. I liked the way Jon's instant recall of a case helped Basira once before, in Police Lights, and the way that seemed to boost his confidence. I'd like to see more of that. 

Jon explains once that he \"has\" to be skeptical, but that he's always believed in the supernatural. Why? How did he end up at the Archive?

My favourite loose thread currently is the Order of the Lightless Flame - mostly because it's the only organised set of people who seem to be fighting some of the powers ... but perhaps in service to other powers? Tell me about them some more?

I have listened through to the end of season two. If season three starts in time for that to impact your story, rest assured that I will be keeping up with canon. Please feel free to either include or ignore any new material as you'd like.

All three of TWD games with Clementine have broken my heart. And the friendship that grew between Javier and Clementine in the most recent game was just really, really great to watch. I'd love anything with these two, but would particularly love something that takes place in the future, like if Clementine finds AJ and returns to Richmond where Javier has taken over as leader. Maybe he teaches them how to play baseball?

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Elliot Schafer (In Other Lands), Luke Sunborn (In Other Lands)

I didn't read <cite>Turn of the Story</cite> while it was up, but I devoured this book as soon as I realised it existed, and promptly ran to get my hands on every extra morsel available by that point. (Note: I'm 100% fine with book-only canon!) I just love Luke Sunborn and his awkward face <em>so much</em>, and I especially love how utterly wrong Elliot gets him, and how they manage to orbit each other so well throughout the years despite being completely clueless. I really enjoy how they keep catching on each other's rough edges because they can't navigate them at all.

I requested these two characters and I do love them to pieces, but if you want to include any others in the tagset (or anyone else) please feel free! This universe is endlessly fascinating to me. I would happily read any and all stories containing things like:

- Elliot being a clever little shit about absolutely anything, take your pick;
- Luke growing to fully understand and accept his half-harpy nature;
- Serene pontificating about something, Serene sharing her misandrist wisdom, Serene and Luke being swordsisters, just: Serene;
- elven society, more about how it works and how their unique little cluster might fit there (or...not);
- wings!! (I'd never realised I liked wingfic before, but hey, apparently I do);
- Woodsinger being awesome and somehow suffering all these fools (<em>how</em>);
- political shenanigans: it's brilliant to see Elliot, Luke and Serene each being awesome in their different ways to unfuck a situation, and if you want to go for plotty fic here, by all means do!

If you have any other ideas, though, please do go for it! These are just suggestions. Anything from family fic about the Sunborns being their usual overwhelming selves to a wild forest OT4 sex marathon will make me thrilled.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alma Innovator Dibars, Yaetr Innovator Dibars

I really enjoyed <cite>The Stone Sky</cite>, and one of the side stories that caught my eye was the letter exchange between Alma Innovator Dibars and Yaetr Innovator Dibars. Yaetr \"discovered\" that orogenes' intervention prevented several seasons in the past, and Alma put an end to that research for political reasons. I couldn't help put wonder what kind of story lurked behind those brief notes.

How did Yaetr start researching roggas? Why look into this, specifically, when the Fulcrum certainly wouldn't have wanted anyone coming anywhere near these conclusions? Was Yaetr at all empathetic or just interested in predicting future Seasons? What was the research process like? What was the relationship between Alma and Yaetr like, and what did it turn into after that event? How did Yaetr take the silencing, what did they do after? What was the environment at the Seventh in Dibars like, did Yaetr and Alma ever overlap there with Tonkee, or with Alabaster or Syenite being used for research?

The way that <cite>The Broken Earth</cite> interweaves questions of oppression, identity and violence with every level and angle of worldbuilding is so well thought-out and executed. It would be interesting to catch another glimpse of this side of events: the many ways that a fact so glaringly obvious and important to keeping everyone alive gets suppressed and ignored to benefit the dominant narrative.

Love for the Cold-Blooded - Alex Gabriel 
Serpentissima (Love for the Cold-Blooded), Tom | Serpent Slut (Love for the Cold-Blooded)

This story was so fun, and I am <em>so here</em> for wacky supervillain family dynamics! They seemed to genuinely care about each other so much, regardless of the fact that they they express affection in somewhat unconventional ways sometimes. I would so happily read more about that in all kinds of ways.

Does Serpentissima try to take over the world again? What's that like for the rest of the family? What about when Hell starts growing into her own independent challenger self and tries her own first major nefarious plot, how do her parents help and/or accidentally thwart her efforts? Or: what's it like for them to have a hoagie in the family? Just how awkward do Christmas dinners get? Or: what's it like for Serpentissima and Tom to have grandchildren? I'd also love to see a flashback to Serpentissima's first ascent and why it failed, or how she ended up falling for Tom in the first place.

Basically, I'd be happy with any story dealing with the unique peculiarities of the West family. Please feel free to include Helena, Boadicea, Zenobia, Patrick and Nick if you wish, as well as any other challengers or superheroes you want!

Peer Gynt - Henrik Ibsen 
Solveig (Peer Gynt)

Solveig has always fascinated me, and we get so little of her in the play, I’d love to see her fleshed out. What made her stay her entire life and wait for Peer? How did she manage in the forest all alone? Or what if she hadn’t? What if she’d gone back to the village? What if she’d followed Peer on his adventures? How would they have turned out differently? Or what if he hadn’t left? What if he hadn’t gone off with Ingrid from Hægstad? Or what if he hadn’t run away when the Greenclad came? Or what if he’d still left, and Solveig was left with the Greenclad’s child? There are so many possibilities!
In general, I like most things. I am a multishipper, and I read slash, het, femslash, and gen. Femslash and gen are especially welcome, as they tend to be underrepresented categories!

I don’t mind non-prompted characters being included.
Tropes that I particularly enjoy are found families, hurt/comfort, POV outsider, canon divergence, characters with low self-worth being loved and accepted, time travel, happy poly relationships, happy asexual characters and relationships, competent characters being awesome, women being super awesome, women supporting other women, 5+1, and crossovers.
I don’t really enjoy PWP – in fact, I prefer any sex scenes to be of the fade to black variety, or referred to, rather than described, if included at all. I also don’t like incest, teacher/student, mpreg or a/b/o, even as romantic tropes. Characters being accused of something they didn’t do tends to make me anxious, so please avoid that if possible. I also don’t like to read about infidelity or about protagonists doing things they know will hurt other protagonists, or about jealousy/love triangles (poly relationships! healthy communication!). Please no character bashing: unless the character is a villain in canon, please write them sympathetically, or leave them out.
This all being said, am not that picky and will enjoy most things if they’re well written enough, if none of my preferred prompts grab your imagination. I’m sure I’ll love whatever you write!

Hidden Figures (2016) 

I loved this film, and think it’s a travesty there’s not more fic for it! Fic celebrating the absolutely fantastic relationship (femslash or gen) between Katherine, Dorothy and Mary, or the ladies being absolutely awesome and kickass the way they were in the movie, or family feels with Katherine and Jim, or what it's like working at NASA, what happens after the film, or anything you like to write is more than welcome!

I like reading about the Circle, and their closeness. I also have a fondness for Tris at Lightsbridge stories, trying to hide who and what she is. I prefer relationships within the Circle and with their teachers and students to be platonic/familial, but am happy to read about them paired with outside characters (canon or OCs). I generally prefer Emelan stories to be set in something approaching the canon world (i.e. medievalist fantasy-like settings), but I’m not averse to broadening my horizons if you really feel the itch to write a completely different world.

League of Legends RPF 

1. I know the Rox Tigers going their separate ways has been written about ad nauseam but I would love a take on it where it isn't actually a terrible thing for everyone, and they figure out how to maintain their friendships with new distance and new loyalties. 

2. Various SKT things I am enthusiastic about: Faker and Huni actually going to Hong Kong, SKT newbies fighting for Faker's attention and affection, Bengi coming back to \"coach\" or work for SKT and how that affects Faker, how Peanut learns to fit into his new team, boys being overly competitive about forced team bonding sports...

3. Regardless of how the season ended I still feel so #/blessed to have had two of my favorites on the same team together. Even from the start they seemed to get along really well and they're both such positive people. I'd love anything about them getting closer as friends or more than friends, especially if it touches on how cuddly Kuro is. Or, just Afreeca as a whole becoming what looked to be like a really friendly and caring team.

4. Literally anything about how much Doublelift thinks Biofrost hung the moon.

David really came into his own at the end of season three, and his relationship to and with his family is another thing I'd enjoy seeing explored, especially in the context of his new business and new partner.

My longing for more of this show has not yet faded. Whitechapel ended just when things were getting <em>really interesting</em>, the relationship between Chandler and Kent being just one of those things. Whether you read it as a crush on Kent's part, a potential relationship for both, or a hero worship/mentor situation, I want to see what happens next. It's not necessary to jump in right where the show left off (though there's a lot of potential there); any time in the future is good. I do ship them, but not to the exclusion of all other possibilities if you don't. And if you <em>do</em>, explicit is more than welcome. Casefic, and casefic mixed with relationship building, are both also excellent. Really, I just want my boys back again.

The Expanse (TV) 
Chrisjen Avasarala (The Expanse (TV)), Bobbie Draper (The Expanse (TV))

I'd love to see some canon divergence or canon speculation about Bobbie and Chrisjen and their relationship development as allies from very different worlds.

I wouldn't mind seeing Chrisjen introducing Bobbie to Earth culture - after seeing Bobbie's delighted reaction to cucumber sandwich hors d'oeuvres and considering my impression of Martian food culture as somewhat ascetic, I kept imagining Chrisjen inviting Bobbie to dinner with her family and introducing Bobbie to an diverse array of Indian food, or some other \"Earther delicacy\".

Alternately, Bobbie introduces Chrisjen to some Martian practice, food, or cultural norm, something that Chrisjen thinks she understands as a life-long diplomat and student of politics, but she finds herself understanding it in a totally new way after learning about it from Bobbie.

I'd be intrigued to see a romantic dalliance between these two, as long as Chrisjen's husband Arjun isn't implied to be a bad person - their relationship is so strong and lovely - but maybe it's an open relationship, or it's an AU where Arjun has died. Bobbie seems to be under the impression that Chrisjen is a fragile little old lady, and though she's been disabused of that notion to some extent now, probably, it would be interesting to see her learn it more intimately!

Fandom-specific DNWs: Though it's unlikely he'd come up, I don't want to read about Joe Miller, please. Other characters appearing, especially Arjun or Cotyar or the Roci crew, are fine

General DNWs:A/B/O dynamics (Werewolves are great, but the A/B/O trope doesn't work for me), mpreg, bestiality, excessive focus on bodily fluids/bodily fluid-focused kinks, age regression in romantic pairing fics (I'm OK with it for platonic pairings!), high school AUs, childhood friends-to-lovers (unless canonical), teacher/student relationships (even when the student is adult)

John Wick (John Wick), Gianna D'Antonio (John Wick)

I would be very pleased to receive straight-up worldbuilding in this setting - please feel free to barely mention either requested character and tell me a story about how you perceive the details of the world. An outsider's POV would be fascinating - either a true outsider to the setting, or someone who works for the Assassins but isn't actually one, perhaps. How did they perceive the events of either film, especially Gianna and/or Santino's deaths and what it means for the future that John flouted the rules so explicitly? How did they perceive - and how do they talk about - the events of John's Task that allowed him to leave their world years ago?

I would also love fic that explores the past that John and Gianna are strongly implied to share. Were they lovers? What was that like? Their hands are metaphorically - and sometimes literally - dripping with blood, the both of them, and while the John of the films seems to be ambivalent about aspects of his past, Gianna seems to be totally unashamed. Has it always been that way?

Alternately, an entirely morbid canon divergence fic in which Gianna requests (demands? draws on old promises to compel?) a final fling with John \"for old time's sake\" before he kills her could be both highly creepy and very hot - dubcon and/or femdom themes welcome. Could still end with Gianna's death or be ambiguous or go entirely AU somehow...

The Vikings (1958) 
Eric (The Vikings 1958), Einar (The Vikings 1958)

Eric and Einar's relationship is such an incredible mix of loathing and jealousy and admiration - you can cut the tension with a knife in their scenes. I would love to see any kind of exploration of their rivalry and what precipitated it - one may be the Jarl's son, and the other a slave, but they grew up together, after all. Would be happy to see Kitala and/or Sandpiper show up in a pre-canon fic like this - how did they become so close to Eric?

I could also see a canon divergence in which Einar does not die, but the two of them remain rivals and warleaders constantly struggling for power - what might that look like? Does Morgana remain a point of contention between them? Does Eric's knowledge of Viking culture make him more successful and fending off Einar's attacks?

I'm absolutely here for a sexual relationship between the two - consensual but heavy on the competitive rivalry, dub-con, or non-con all welcome, either pre-canon, at any point during the film, or canon divergence. One specific point of divergence that might work well is when Einar attempts to rape Morgana, he's put off by her total passivity and lack of response to his urging to fight him - perhaps he goes looking for Eric with the assumption that Eric will fight back.
Fandom-specific DNW: I would prefer no Modern AUs in this fandom. Also, I'm fine with seeing the characters interact as children or teens, but if there's any sexual content, please age the characters at least to \"ambigously late teens\" at minimum.

Wonder Woman: Warbringer - Leigh Bardugo 
Alia Keralis, Diana (Wonder Woman: Warbringer), Theo Santos, Poornima \"Nim\" Chaudhary

I adored this book and would love any story from this universe. Post-canon/future fic would be amazing! I know we likely caught a glimpse of the future at the end of the book, but there's so much that will happen between that vision and where the book ends, and it would be wonderful to see all four of these characters growing into those people. OR if you have an idea for what that future adventure entails, that would also be excellent!

Wonder Woman (2017) 
The Amazons (Wonder Woman 2017)

Hey, so, I cry through this entire movie beginning with the scene where the Amazons are training, so, I have a lot of just general Amazons feelings and would be super here for literally anything about life on the island? I loved all the Amazon characters in the tag set but I settled with just tagging \"Amazons\" in my signup because I would love a story about any or all of them. Like, tell me about law and politics on Themiscyra and give those Senators the backstory they deserve, write the epic love story of Menalippe and Antiope, the comedy and drama of Diana's revolving door of tutors, a day in the life of Philippus who is clearly the smartest Amazon and knew if they killed Steve Trevor immediately they wouldn't learn anything, Clio's process (ahem) of writing her lengthy treatise on bodily pleasure, the trials and tribulations of Epione as she tries to be the healer for an island of warriors,  Diana's secret training sessions with Antiope.... Literally, dear author, you could write a story about the curator of what is essentially the Amazon museum and fancy weapons emporium and how upset she was to discover Diana had made a bunch of holes in the exterior wall and made off with weapons and armor and I would be delighted. IT'S AN ISLAND OF WOMEN, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

The Proposal (2009)

This movie essentially is just a showcase of so many of my favorite tropes-- sharing a bed, pretending to be in a relationship/falling for each other as a result, cuddling for warmth-- so basically go wild with tropey stuff if you feel like it. Post-movie dating fic would be great, like, obviously they have feelings for each other but how is Margaret handling being a hardass professional editor and also a human being with emotions she lets other people see (even if the other people are just Andrew?)? Is Andrew an editor now? Does that make them rivals professionally? How's that working out (could be hot! could be hilarious! could be both!)?

Shinreigari GHOST HOUND 
Komori Tarou, Oogami Makoto

Request: I'm here for anything about these two and their fraught relationship! Another kidnap and rescue, if you like high drama, would be awesome. I'd love to get into interpersonal relationship drama, if they are openly struggling to be friends despite the difficulty between the branches of the family-- or more than friends if you're inclined to explore the ways they are broken-but-together. On a different note from teens struggling with their senses of self, I would be interested to see the future where they both try to fulfill their places in the family businesses- Makoto as the fortune teller and Taro making truly mind-altering sake, or having traded family trades. If you're into writing poetical things, it would be wonderful to see Taro help Makoto try to turn their hauntings into a song, or getting together with Makoto to make or use gadgets to catch supernatural sounds for sampling in Makoto's music. Nightmares, or being trapped together, or some outside force pushing them to work together through their feelings of connectedness and forced separation- the scarier and more vulnerable for them, the better! I' excited for gen fic as well as ship fic for these unhealthy cousins. I am a sucker for anything resembling a bully-to-protector redemption arc. I love how much tension and distance there is between Taro and Makoto at the beginning of the show, and the underlying current of affection and concern that they have for each other - a mutual desire to protect the other from harm (including the potential harm of dealing with each other, early on). I love them as awkward friends or distant relatives as much as I love them as bonded or brotherly, and anything about their difficult progress together will make me happy. I should probably note that when I say \"bully to protector\", I don't mean to imply that Makoto is necessarily always the bully or the protector in any of these situations, and I'd love a fic about his feelings (including those of resentment) with regards to Taro and their connections or shared experiences, for example.

Yes, Please: body horror, darkfic, established or developing relationships, angst, trauma and dissociation

Frozen Teardrop (Light Novels) 

Request: I know these light novels are much loathed by a lot of the fandom, but I really enjoyed some of the character building details and the glimpse of the Mars Century the characters were dreaming of in their After Colony days. I love Kathy, and her no-nonsense attitude despite the fact that she is a Gundam novel protagonist doomed to deal with a lot of nonsense from the new generation and old fogeys alike. I'd love to see more of her thoughts on the other nominated characters and how the legend of who they were was built up, not just by her mom in fond recollection, by the society their interventions created. Chang's long-term management in the Preventers sticks out as one of the few consistencies in the lives of the pilots postwar experiences-- sure enough, he gets the job done through persistence and has a lasting effect unlike any other. All of these poor fools at the end of the epilogue having to deal with Father Maxwell becoming President Maxwell would also make for a great adventure-- maybe involving Mars' new high speed railways? Maybe a smuggling case involving Instructor W's work as a disavowed-and-disowned castoff of the Winner corporation sees new suits or full-body/spinal column mech integration plans for the Zero System's next next next gen fall into dangerous hands, or former debtors are leaning on Maxwell for a sweet business deal? Kathy as interpersonal investigator of the wreckage of these friendships, or Chang's Girl Friday, or the spitting image of Sally not taking any of Maxwell's shit or W's sweetness would warm my little heart.

Yes Please: casefic, stories in the form of news or reports, on-the-job-training, office comedy, hard sci-fi setting treated as utterly mundane, Kathy matchmaking, character studies, found family.

Mihashi Ren, Haruna Motoki

Request: I've been re-reading lately and thinking fondly of Mihashi and Haruna having their pitching genius bonding session while Abe and Akimaru sort of sulked and watched the pitchers grope each other. My simple desires are for Mihashi to have a friend who appreciates his strength and stamina despite being definitively better and encouraging him to go pro, and for Haruna to have a kouhai or friend who isn't terrified of him or tired of his shit, who can give him a chance to shine as a teacher and motivator. I feel like their dynamic could take many roads to infuriatingly good friendship, or build a future dynamic between them as a pro starter and relief team, and want to read all the possibilities your heart (or theirs) might contain. I love that these baseball nuts have fun together, despite how different they seem. Do they come up with a scheme during Haruna's draft season? Could they be secret training buddies? I'd love to see Haruna preening at the chance to show off his knowledge, dedication and prowess, and Mihashi's diligence and hunger for pitching power and speed getting them both fired up.

Yes, Please: nonverbal communication, rivals-to-friends and friends-to-rivals, secret relationship tropes, buddy comedy, road trip or shopping trip hijinx, montage or vignettes of developing relationships, after hours at the batting cages, hero worship, body worship, bullying as bonding, story in the form of text logs/modern epistolary

神撃のバハムート | Shingeki no Bahamut | Rage of Bahamut (Anime) 
Nina Drango, Favaro Leone

Request: Thirsty Redheads: Apprentice and Mentor Edition! That is to say, I loved the episode focused on Nina and Favaro's brief training time together, and greatly enjoy their dynamic and the way she mirrors a lot of his traits from Genesis. Missing scenes from their time as \"Master\" and \"apprentice\", or scenes from the present-day of the canon of their adventurous hijinks fomenting civil unrest in the capitol would lend to the sort of swashbuckling action the show does so well. I'd be interested in a postcanon take on their feelings around Amira and Charioce, or Bahamut and Chris. Favaro meeting Nina's totally epic grandma and trading a tall tale for some secret power or object (or the company of the right beauty, knowing that guy) would make for a fun re-telling by Nina to the gang over drinks. Precious dragon girl and her sneakthief teacher/big brother/dirty uncle lying through their teeth badly and still managing to get away from some high class banquet with a whole roast pig and a bandolier of turkey legs sounds about perfect. If you want to go the sex-comedy route, Nina trying to get advice about her first time from this asshole Favaro would be great. EDITED TO ADD-- now that the series is over, I can also say that I loved the ending, so if you want to jump off of the canon into future adventures, I would love to see how they go!

Yes, Please: buddy comedy, slapstick, lying badly, lying brilliantly, unreliable narrators, tall tales or campfire stories, found family, unwise advice, cast cameos and background pairings (especially Rita/Kaisar, or Rita/Kaisar/Favaro)

Peter Darling - Austin Chant 

I love how this book plays with the idea of Neverland being real and unreal, and the concept of growing up and facing reality--how you need to do it eventually, but there are some things that you believe you can only achieve in your dreams, how you run away from the real world out of pain or fear. Also loved the characters, obviously! Peter/James and Peter/Ernest both strike me as very good ships, and Tink's loyalty to Peter as well as her background friendship with Hook are very interesting. A fic that plays with the reality/make believe and coming of age themes would be particularly interesting to me.

Nick Carraway (Great Gatsby - Fitzgerald), Jay Gatsby (Great Gatsby - Fitzgerald)

I definitely believe Nick is either gay or bi--in any case, not straight. Nick/Gatsby fic would be fun. I do think Nick certainly has a crush on him in canon. But I'd also be interested to see fics about them separate of their relationship if that's your thing, especially Nick, who feels both isolated from the world of New York and intrigued by it. Of course a lot of Nick's personality in The Great Gatsby is shown in relation to Gatsby and vice versa, so perhaps they do better together after all.
DNW: PWP. In this fandom I don't actually mind major character death since it's canon, but I'd still prefer to see Gatsby live if possible.

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

Look, I'm going to be honest with you here: I went to Dunkirk for Harry Styles. I mean, I would have seen it anyway, because I'm a WWII buff, but fundamentally, Harry Styles. I was not expecting to end up with a massive Jack Lowden crush along the way. But here we are.

I would love any kind of story dealing with the relationship between Collins and Farrier. I totally slash them, but if you don't, feel free to stick with a brotherly dynamic. I'd like something centered around the War (pre-, during, or immediately post), no present-day AUs. However, I'd be utterly tickled by a wartime AU where same-sex love was totally normal and accepted, maybe even honored in the military (where a wingman can be like a shieldmate). Not a necessity, but feel free to go that way if that tickles your fancy as well.

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* Something when they first meet when Collins joins the squadron before the war starts. Maybe they're a little prickly at first, being very different personalities and backgrounds, but they can't seem to stop dancing around each other. Eventually they realize they're both men for men and one of them decides to court the other amid the chaos of the oncoming war.
* Farrier escapes the enemy and makes his way back home, maybe in time to fight with Collins in the Battle of Britain, or maybe arriving just after and fearing what he'll find. 
* Either before Dunkirk or later in the war, one of them gets shot down and the other is sure that they didn't make it (but of course they did)
* A series of times they flew together, on patrol or in battle. 

DNW: no death, please! Assumed death for the sake of angst is just fine, as long as it has the comfort payoff. And please no pairing them with other people, whether or not you write them as lovers.

Dunkirk-specific likes: I adore dogfight scenes where you can feel the adrenaline rush. Out of all the various first names I've seen for Collins in fic, my favorite is Ainsley (no preference for Farrier's). I'd be happy to see any of the other Dunkirk characters around as secondary characters, as long as there's a logical reason for them to be there. For the record, I also adore Tommy/Alex as a pairing, so if for whatever reason the Collins/Farrier isn't floating your boat, I would also be perfectly happy with a Tommy/Alex story (not that the two of them have a great record with floating boats).

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 
Ralph Lanyon, Laurie Odell

When I got obsessed with Dunkirk, I remembered that one of my old favorite Mary Renault books was actually set right after Dunkirk. So I decided to re-read it and tumbled right back down the rabbit hole, harder than ever. I am completely obsessed and fascinated with Ralph and Laurie as individual characters and as a couple. 

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* An AU where Ralph doesn't start anything with Hazell. He and Laurie become closer while still at school and become lovers long before Dunkirk.
* Anything set soon after the end of the book as they try to get their relationship on solid ground amid the chaos of war.
* Something exploring Ralph's POV at the end of the book. How did he end up so close to suicide? What did he feel when he walked into his flat and saw Laurie there? The final words of the book imply that they were able to finally stop fighting all the things driving them and rest together - but how did that look, the rest of that night? (alternatively: Alec's POV as he figures out what's going on, sends Laurie to Ralph, and then waits to discover the outcome)
* Or Ralph's POV during the infamous party scene - how he felt when he first saw Laurie alive and well, all the pushes and pulls he must have felt during those hours, dealing with everything going on at the party, longing for Laurie but still so unsure of him, trying to get his own head together while also managing everyone else.

DNW: no death, no infidelity, no Andrew (unless it's a scene of him meeting the real Ralph, but please no lingering romantic feelings to/from Laurie). Beyond the level of the books, no feckless or submissive Laurie or domineering or condescending Ralph.

Charioteer-specific likes: I love Laurie and Ralph as equal partners, each bringing their own strengths to the relationship. I love Laurie learning to take care of Ralph as much as Ralph takes care of him, and Ralph learning to allow and enjoy it. I love Laurie learning how he wants to define himself as a queer man and figuring out how he fits into that world on his own terms. I really like Alec as a side character, and I'm fond of Sandy as well (if you include him, please don't treat him poorly! he's capable of growth, too!). I also wouldn't mind Bunny popping back into the scene, if you think of something interesting to do with him - particularly interacting with a Laurie more confident in himself and Ralph's love. I also love outsider POVs on their relationship.

Lethal Weapon (TV) 
Trish Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Roger Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Brooks Avery (Lethal Weapon (TV))

This is my little stealth fandom that no one else seems to love! I adore this show and all the characters and their relationships. The Riggs/Murtaugh relationship is the absolute perfect slashy bromance -- I'd love a story focusing on that relationship whether it's platonic bros or bickering lovers. Either way, though, Trish needs to be fully aware and involved, because I love her and her relationship with Roger. I guess what I really want is to see Riggs getting semi-reluctantly absorbed into the Murtaugh family. I also tagged Captain Avery here because he is so long-sufferingly awesome and I would be so happy if he were involved as a major character dealing with his brilliant asshole cops. 

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* Riggs and Murtaugh trying to cope with their first family Christmas, possibly including some criminal hijinx that keep pulling them away from the eggnog
* Murtaugh has a near-death experience (another heart attack, shot, whatever) and gets to talk to Miranda Riggs before he's brought back 
* One of them gets kidnapped and the other works with Captain Avery to rescue him in time.

DNW: no death (real death, assumed death for the sake of angst is A-okay!), no infidelity (polyamory in any configuration is also A-okay!)

LW-specific likes: show-level banter, all the side characters (but maybe less of Jordana Brewster as the Worst Psychologist Ever, unless it's for amusing therapy sessions which would be awesome), the awesomeness of the Murtaugh family, those moments when Murtaugh proves he's just as crazy as Riggs, outsider POVs on their relationship

I really love both characters. They're both broken in such complementary ways, and I enjoy seeing that contrast between them. I also really like when writers deal with how having a homosexual relationship in the 80s was very different from having one now. I'm up for anything with them, with a particular fondness for getting together/having a secret relationship and the fallout of that/what they do when they graduate.

Keith's muppet face. I enjoy the Try Guys because they're so nonstereotypicaly masculine and endlessly comfortable with the sheer number of times they've seen each other naked for the camera. I want so, so badly for the story of how Eugene and Keith hooked up during the filming of testing the legal blood alcohol limit, but am also up for anything else involving them. They both have such great senses of humor, and I'd like to see that translated. Or, alternatively, filming the apocalypse. Because what else are they going to do?

Liar! Uncover the Truth (Visual Novel) 
Main Character (Liar!), Katagiri Keima (Liar!), Mamiya Haruichi (Liar!)

I requested the MC along with two of my favorite guys, even if they're both liars.   Keima because his lover ending stands out as the only one where the guy works his ass off to fix his faults and become worthy of the MC's affections instead of just sorta hovering around pestering her until she decides they're too pathetic to not hear out, Haruichi because even if you don't purchase his complete route he's the only one who across all of his endings (except the bad end, which just feels out of character compared to the rest) is obviously really in love with the MC. Also, his lie is a pretty sexy one.  I'd like shippy fic with one of the guys or the other, but you don't need to have the the other show up!

I also really enjoy how the game makes it clear that the MC is not the greatest prize herself, while she's pretty and fun she's also terrible at being an adult and too judgmental (with the two guys here it's very obvious in Haruichi's route, where she's constantly having unkind thoughts about poor Ayumi even though the poor kid's obviously super on her side). The only thing I ask when it comes to picking a name for her is that you go with one that's Japanese.

Soooo, I totally went into this game expecting Joseph to be the guy I would totally hate only to end up on the \"Oh my god, give these poor guys a happy ending! He can dump my character while he works through things, that's fine, but that marriage needs to end!\" side.  So, yes, always more fix-it fic please! And, like I said, I would totally count it as being fix-it if the two guys don't end up together but their time together it just the push Joseph needs to get out of that marriage.

One thing I will say is that I prefer you not run with the word of god that Joseph was comfortably bi all along. He doesn't need to angst over being gay, but if he's not at least firmly in the closet to 99.9% of the world the lack of a good ending just feels even more annoying.

Ha, I totally didn't plan to request this again when I just got a wonderful story for the pairing in Press Start, but then I saw that *someone else* had nominated Ignatius and went \"Well, okay, this is clearly a sign.\"

You know, the only reason I ever got this ending was because I wanted to get the achievement for getting him to divorce then figured I might as well go for the match, because otherwise I would never be willing to toss Julianna in jail and not release her. So I was honestly surprised when I got it and it turned out to be one of my very favorites. I really like how we know from WoG that the reason he abstains at the vote of no confidence is because he's grateful to her for his position but thinks that she's completely mad for treating his sister the way she did, and it takes you literally making her the very best Elodie she can be to make him see her as someone he could love, and even then she really has to work for it to make him consider marrying someone so young showing that she must genuinely want to be with him to bother. And, honestly, it just makes me happy for the poor guy to finally have someone who really wants him.

I do ship future Sasha/Raz, but absolutely do not feel like you need to work that in if it squicks you.

I'd love some mission fic. You don't even need to go deeply into what the mission itself is, I'd just be really interested in seeing how the brain-diving we do in-game translates to using it against villains who are actively fighting them instead of people who area generally okay with them being in there. Future summers at camp would be fun too! I always see Raz as continuing to go even when he's too old for it, because he's still too young to be recognized as a real Psychonaut and they're the only ones who treat him like he is one anyway. Maybe he starts acting as a counselor himself?

There's something about the tone of this film that I absolutely love - how absurd it is and yet how Adele takes everything in stride so matter of factly. I love the two sisters and their relationship and how Adele portrays it and how it actually was and how she does love her sister. I love Adele and her penchant for ridiculoaus disguises. To be honest, I'd love to see anything set in this world but particular favourites of mine are the sisterly relationship, Adele going after what she wants with utter determination, and the blending of the historical time period with fantastical elements. Also, Patmosis and the mummies remain hilarious to me.

I would enjoy gen fic quite a bit, so no need to worry about pairing, but for info's sake, pairings I love: Luke/Jessica, Matt/Foggy, pairings I don't mind: Matt/Jess, Claire/Luke, Jess/Trish. Not a big fan of anything else, sorry!

Gerta (The Raven and the Reindeer), Janna (The Raven and the Reindeer), Mousebones (The Raven and the Reindeer)

Very simply i want to know What Happened After. A bit of Janna backstory would be lovely too. But what are the pitfalls and discoveries on the way to the HEA? Alternatively, what is the next ig adventure? Do they set off to fight an unfriendly giant, find more royalty to unseat, adopt a cat?

Frequency (2000) 
Frank Sullivan (Frequency (2000)), John Sullivan (Frequency (2000))

I've provided prompts, but feel free to deviate, and please, please, please, don't confuse number of prompts, their degree of detail, or apparent enthusiasm for having favorites that I want more than the others. Everything is here because it's something I want.  General likes and fandom details in the letter.

DO NOT WANTS
* A/B/O, soul-bonding, love potions, etc. (basically, no supernatural/mystical/magical relationship dynamic)

* Non-canon established relationships

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS: Two lines prompt three scenarios for me.
1. \"She just died? Your mother just died?\" \"No, Dad. It happened a long time ago for me.\"

After this exchange, Frank considers a future without Julia and what it would be like to raise John by himself.

Lop off the last half of that conversation, and give me a story where Julia really DID just die in the future and Frank has to talk a devastated John through it.

2. \"Time to die, soldier,\"
(Said on John's end, heard on Frank's)

Frank's forgotten a lot of things in his lifetime, but he's carried those four words in his head for 30 years. Show me Old Man Frank Sullivan, waiting for the day he knows is coming. The day the man who tried to kill his wife will try to kill his son.

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS:  I just want more. It can be case-fic. It can be fluffy. It can be gen or shipfic or just about anything in between. One idea I was kind of wrangling with was for Jack and Theresa to be getting married but their wedding day is made all the more chaotic by Dan's journeys as they all have to add covering for him to their duties. And maybe something about what Dan's doing in the past disrupts Jack and Theresa in the future and he has to fix it? Or maybe Dan's journeys to the past help Jack solve a case in the present (and get Dan a big story for the paper). Or Katie and Theresa talk about life with Vasser men or about life in general, IDK. Or Katie has to go out of town for a week and since Zack can't miss that much school and Dan's erratic time-traveling isn't good for single parenting, they stay with Jack and hijinks ensue. Just, more Journeyman for everyone and no breaking up of Katie/Dan.

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS: Prompt 1: Jarod finds himself in a cuddling group and ends up getting all the affection he missed out on at The Centre. Please stay fluffy and nonsexual.

Prompt 2 : Jarod is taking a break from cases while pretending to be a teacher at a boarding school when a death starts to look like more than an accident. Or maybe there really is no case there and he just uses his experience to be a good mentor to a bunch of kids.

CRACK PROMPT CROSSOVER ALERT: Jarod has another younger brother -- immediately put up for adoption to keep him safe from The Centre. His name: Phil Dunphy, and when Jarod  finds him, he gains the biggest modern family he's ever known. I'd be happy with this set any time from present day to pre-series for Modern Family and as fluff or more serious with Miss Parker, Sidney and Broots catching up to them and discovering Phil (and Haley, Alex or Luke if it's set late enough). Basically, I just really want Phil to be a long lost Jarod brother, and would be happy with pretty much any circumstance. My research has Jarod born around 1960 and Phil around 1969. Feel free to play around with time/ages if you want more current Modern Family but early-series Pretender. I don't necessarily need Jarod to be pushing 60 when he finds Phil. Also feel free to ignore the Pretender movies and, really, a lot of the late-series conspiracy stuff.

In general, I like fics that either emulate the style of the source material or that work to subvert that style in an interesting way. I love happy endings, first time stories, stories about friendship, adventure stories, introspective pieces, comedies and angst! You see, I really will be happy with whatever you write! I love AUs and crossovers, if you're struck by one of those (my LJ profile should give you a hint as to the fandoms I know - I'm not into many of the large fandoms of the last few years).

I'd love a story where either Michitaka or Kiyoi gets caught up in some trouble that only the other can help with - whether Michitaka needs help in being extricated from some vampire politics, or Kiyoi and the boys find they need extra help when new vampire hunters come to town, etc. (The other characters are lovely, but if you don't find they fit in your story, that's fine!)

Broadchurch 
Alec Hardy, Ellie Miller (Broadchurch)

Do I ever love this show! It's so heavy and atmospheric without being totally devoid of hope, and I'd be equally happy with a story that carries the canon's tone or with something softer. I have a hard time picturing David Tennant in any role other than \"gruff Scottish detective\" now; Hardy won me over as soon as I learned he took the fall for his ex-wife to save his daughter grief. I love the contrasts in Miller, too, and seeing her solve murders with a brilliant tenacity while she flaps along in a bright orange coat pushing a baby stroller is absolutely one of my favorite things about the show. 

I definitely ship Hardy/Miller, but gen about either one of them would be fantastic, too. What I like about them both are their relationships with their kids, their shared devotion to their job, and the confrontational and slightly off-kilter ways they have of interacting with the world.

I'm definitely a big fan of the cosmic exploration angle and don't mind at all if you'd like to go more conceptual with the story. I'm most familiar with the more modern incarnation of the team and prefer those characterizations, although I'm (slowly!) working my way through the earlier comics, too.

Or! Any headcanon you have about her backstory, where she came from and how she joined up, how her magic works; where she ends up post-movie, or shipfic of her and ... well, lots of people! Arthur? Maggie? Catia, in an AU where she lives (or can be retrieved from the syrens' magical waters)? (If you want to go by behind-the-scenes stuff and consider her Guinevere, that's fine by me! Or is she Merlin, reincarnated? A relation or alternate manifestation of the Lady of the Lake? Someone else entirely?)

Vicious - V. E. Schwab 
Victor Vale, Eli Cardale | Eli Ever

I really enjoyed this book, and I love how deeply dysfunctional the relationship between Victor and Eli is, and how obsessed they are with each other. A large part of what I enjoy about them is that despite how much they hate each other, they're clearly the most important person in each other's life (in a pretty messed up way, sure, but still).

I'd love to see some one-on-one time between the both of them. Maybe a canon divergent AU where Victor succeeds in capturing Eli by himself, and makes the most of the fact that no matter how much he hurts him, Eli just keeps healing himself. 

Or maybe Victor remains dead after the events at the end of the book and comes back as a ghost to haunt Eli (which considering Eli could conceivably live forever, could go on for quite a long time). Maybe he's really a ghost, maybe he's just a product of Eli's imagination. I could see it go either way. 

These are just a couple of ideas, but I'm open to anything, really, though I would really like their relationship to remain antagonistic.

The Lion in Winter (1968) 
Geoffrey Plantagenet (The Lion in Winter)

\"No one ever thinks of crowns and mentions Geoff, why is that?\" 

I love Geoffrey. I think he's easily the smartest of Eleanor and Henry's sons, and I'd love to see that explored in fic. 

Here are some ideas:

1. Young Geoffrey, growing up in the shadow of his impressive elder brothers and even more impressive parents, witnessing the progressive deterioration of his parents' marriage.
2. How did Geoffrey deal with the news of Eleanor's imprisonment?
3. Geoffrey plotting and scheming his way around the ambitions and indifference of his family.

Letter here:-

What if the first Mrs Rochester never really existed? Bertha Mason could be a projection of Jane's own feverish imagination, a cover for Jane's own acts of violent insanity. Echoes of the Turn of the Screw, or an all-out cross-over, would work here.
Could Helen Burns have survived the horrors of Lowood School? If Helen unexpectedly arrived at Thornfield (during or post-canon) how would this impact upon Jane/Rochester? Jane/Helen or Jane/Rochester/Helen would work for me.
Fic about Helen's illness and death, and Jane's response to the loss of her friend, as told from the POV of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent 
Daniel (Amnesia), Justine Florbelle

One idea that’s been occupying my brain for years is Daniel interacting with Justine. Going by the game’s timeline, it is very possible for these two to meet. One specific prompt I have is for an older Daniel, who’s escaped Brennenburg, to have met up with Justine in France, once he’s become a lead in his Archeology field. I’m very interested in seeing these two in a bad/wrong ship, with both of their grievous sins coming to a head. (Justine seems perfectly fine with what she’s done, while Daniel is wracked by guilt, enough for self-induced amnesia). I’d love to see them relate to one another, and see where their darkness goes. Considering the subject of this game, I am more open to concepts of torture or non-con, or just any general terribleness. You are also free to portray them as platonic just as well! Just for this request, I’d like fluff/happiness to be as minimal as possible – as this is a canon where I see very little of that.

Super optional request!:  I am also open to crossovers for other Frictional games. Both Penumbra and SOMA have very similar elements and protagonists, and either through weird magic or just general past/present explanations, I’d love to see a story where these canons intersect.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
Mipha (Legend of Zelda), Link (LoZ: Breath of the Wild), Urbosa (Legend of Zelda), Revali (Legend of Zelda)

Been a fan of Legend of Zelda for many years and this new addition didn’t disappoint. However, I really wanted to learn more about the characters, and so I’m hoping for some more in-depth backstory characters such as Mipha, especially in regards to her relationship with Link. It seems they grew up together, so how did that mesh with their different ways of life? Did Link live with the Zora? How did their relationship to each other change once he became Zelda’s knight? Can definitely be written as a ship, and am also intrigued with a smut-leaning if you want to go in that direction.

I would also love to see more into earlier beginnings with Revali, and Daruk, and Urbosa. Including Mipha, I’d like to see how all these great heroes of their peoples worked together, and if there was any general misunderstandings or difficulties, and how they overcame them. An exploration into their deaths is also something intriguing. Of course, you can just mix and match which characters can interact as well! (I could not fit in Daruk as a requested character, so feel free to skip him if you'd like). I’d also be ecstatic to see a bit more worldbuilding explored for this canon – it was amazing to see that in the game, and having more details to just see the world and history that connects with previous LoZ canons would be great to read and learn about.

American Gods (TV) 
Mr. Wednesday (American Gods (TV)), Essie MacGowan (American Gods (TV)), Mad Sweeney (American Gods (TV))

The show has done such a unique job of representing many of the god characters, both old and new, and some of their backstories as well. I’d love to see someone’s take on Mr. Wednesday, perhaps more from when he was first brought to America and his general perception of it, as well as his own initial interactions with other gods/deities, such as Easter or Mad Sweeney, and how he came to be how he is. Any expansions on mythology and the like, general talk about different pantheons and religions, and utilizing the god characters as perhaps as just a concept for something else – I am very open to various interpretations of the show and all the characters.

For something perhaps a bit more grounded, a look into Essie MacGowan and Mad Sweeney is also ideal. I wanted more interactions between them, and maybe something like that could be alluded to in their past together, or a more introspective look into Mad Sweeney’s connection to her. Can be romantic, platonic, or somewhere in between!

Humans (TV) 
Leo Elster, Mattie Hawkins, Hester (Humans)

I would love any exploration of Leo/Hester and/or Leo/Mattie. I love all three of those characters and find the relationship dynamics fascinating.Please note: there is no need to include all three of the characters in the fic. You can also include any other characters from the show.

Possible prompts:
--Explicit fic of Hester and Leo having sex. Any dynamic of coercion, exploration, pleasure or pain would be more than fine. I imagine Leo is sort of interested and willing but naive, and I can see Hester being either more sadistic or kinky than he could ever have realized, or oddly kinder to him when they’re having sex.
--Mattie thinking about Leo being with Hester (sexually or otherwise)
--Mattie and Leo talking (or kissing or whatever) after Hester is gone, or maybe even just while she’s away somewhere. It could be after the events of S2, and we can just assume Leo gets fixed and is back to (his) normal. ;)

--early on flirtation/first time kissing/late-night hotel-room high-jinks

Possible prompts:
--Any fic that would involve Ravi, Liv, and Lowell--could be just the three of them chatting in the morgue, they could be out somewhere case-related, could be something where Liv talks to one of them, then the other (about a cure, or sex, or a common brain they’re on, or whatever).
--I thought it would have been PERFECT if Lowell had been around to be on that frat-boy party brain with Liv in episode 2.02, “Zombie Bro.” I’d love a fic that just explores the stupid fun they would have had at that party.
--Liv eats one of those brains that makes her super horny, and Ravi calls Lowell to get him to “deal” with her.
--Ravi has been keeping Lowell’s body in a drawer at the morgue this whole time, waiting for the day he could figure out how to bring him back. He does, and Liv now has to figure out where he fits into her life. (Could be set whenever with whatever going on with her. I’m fine with Liv/Major or any other relationship being part of the fic.)

The Folk Keeper - Franny Billingsley 
Corinna Stonewall, Finian Hawthorne

I adore the world of this slim story. Like, I love, love, love how Billingsley uses festivals, feast days, um British/Irish/Scottish folklore and superstitions, and folk customs that mark the passage of the year to frame Corinna’s story. (I’m such a dork for studying festivals and folk customs anyway, so Billingsley drawing on these traditions to make a kinda 17th or 18th century-esque fantasy world is like catnip for me. Like, oh my gosh, the Midsummer bonfire in this story and the throwing of the peats! Ah!!) I also love how much potential there is to explore gender identity and expression in writing fic about Corinna. Corinna as Corin can be so wonderfully snippy, vengeful, and wary - and then she has these moments of wonder and fondness as she discovers her love for the ocean, sailing, and Finian - or delights in her hard won knowledge and abilities. At the end of the book, the focus is so much on whether she’s going to go to sea as a seal maiden or stay with Finian and Lady Alicia, whether she’s going to give up words and language or keep them, that her transformation from Corin with his folk bag to Corinna in layers of petticoats is less explored. Toward the end, she says, “It never ends, this business of being a lady,” and I am so curious about how that plays out in her future. I would be  interested in any kind of story that examines how Corinna reconciles her Corin-self and possible Corinna-self after the ending of the novel. If the idea is of any interest to you, dear writer, I would be over the moon for a genderqueer Corin/na (I mean, genderqueer in our modern terms :)) dressed like a young lord or fisherman, working on boats with Finian - and a Finian who tries to figure out his attraction to the Corinna he knew as Corin and the person Corinna’s becoming now. If gender themes don’t interest you, dear writer, I know I would be pleased as anything to read more about Corinna and Finian’s romance or their life and adventures at Marblehaugh Park after the events of the novel. Or if you are drawn to write into some other part of the storyline, that’d be cool too. This book is such a treasure; if you love it too, I know I’ll totally enjoy whatever you’re moved to write based on it. :)

Jack Wolff (Everything I Never Told You), Nath Lee (Everything I Never Told You)

Oh my goodness, Jack and Nath! Jack and Nath. How much do I love them, ahh. So, I wrote a story for this novel last Yuletide and had the pleasure of really delving into the 1970s Midwest setting and the characters, Jack in particular. The experience left me hungry to read more about them! I would love to see more fic for this ship, for this story; if you’ve matched me for this book, dear writer, I am just so excited to read your ideas, your characterizations, the themes you connect to in Everything I Never Told You. Here’s a bit about what draws me to the novel: the way the book deals with grief and how people move through it/around in it, the exploration of the racism Nath faces, the themes about alienation and the struggle for connection within families. I’m totally down to read about Jack and Nath getting together, making it work - how Nath realizes he has feelings for Jack - how Jack finally confesses his feelings for Nath, that sort of thing. It’d be rad to read a story set when they’re in college, where they visit each other in college and get together - or try to figure out how to keep a spark they discovered before they left home going in this new phase of their lives/amidst new geographies. I bet late 70s/early 80s Harvard would be super interesting. I’d also be really fascinated by a modern AU or probably any kind of fun AU. (I’m such a sucker for AUs. :D) Can't wait to read what you dream up! :)

The Book of Salt - Monique Truong 
Binh (The Book of Salt), Bao (The Book of Salt)

Ooh, dang, so if you’ve matched me for this book, dear writer, BLESS. I will sincerely be happy with whatever your heart draws you to explore here, I am pretty certain. Um, I love Binh - how wry, self-deprecating, yearning, and funny he is. I read this book years ago and then reread it this past year, and oh, I had forgotten how charming Binh is, even when his humor and outlook on life are also heartbreaking. I’m moved by his drinking, his cutting, and his incredible observations about class and the nature of working for others, doing something so intimate as preparing their food. And you know, of course, the book is so lyrical and devastating, with all Binh’s thoughts about belonging, home, exile, and the warmth of fleeting embraces and encounters. Oh my goodness, okay, in terms of prompts, if I had to pick one dynamic to focus on...the wish of my heart is for a deeper exploration of Binh's relationship with Bao. Like, I love the setting of the ship, the tiny room with its bunks that they share, the fact that they’re at sea, which is a world in and of itself, a world apart from the world. I love their relationship, which Binh reveals to us bit by bit - Bao’s tall tales, his advice about hiding oneself, the way they both hide themselves and also give themselves to each other. (And don’t even get me started about the revelation about their names, ahhh!) Would I be oh so down for some hot feelingsy smut from their time at sea together? Oh yes, yes I would. If you are a looking-forward sort of person who wants to write a happier ending for Binh where he meets Bao again, would I be down for that? Yes, yes. Binh’s brief relationship and continued fascination with the man on the bridge is also really interesting, and I’d be down to read a further exploration of that. I didn’t request him or Lattimore but just as the novel weaves together Binh’s experiences with each of them, I’d be down to read a story where Binh still thinks about or encounters any of these lovers. I just…I don’t know, I love him with Bao the most, and I’m most curious about how he and Bao lived together, what they found in each other - even how they might find each other again. But seriously, if you’ve matched me for this book, I’m just super excited to see what makes you passionate about it and what elements of it you’re moved to write about. :)

This movie was such a treat! I loved the music and sound themes woven throughout, the intricacy of the characters, and the heart racing pace.

But if that is not your speed, I'll also be totally happy with Buddy/Darling being sweet and sexy, or some Baby &amp; Buddy and/or Baby &amp; Darling bonding.

The Orville (TV) 
Ed Mercer, Alara Kitan

This show has been the biggest surprise of the year for me. I went in expecting Family Guy in Space, but instead was given sincere, fun old school Trek-like sci-fi. And I love the insecurities these two must have, despite their obvious strengths. Ed is captain of the Orville, but had a year where he totally went off the deep end and has zero experience helming a ship before. Alara is has more physical strength than anyone on the Orville, but she's also one of the youngest and least experienced on the crew.

I'm only requesting Alara and Ed, but feel free to throw in any of the crew. I love all of them! This canon is currently airing, and I have zero idea what to expect. Feel free to go with an idea that comes up based on future episodes!

Space: 1999 
Tony Verdeschi, Maya (Space: 1999)

This is my \"someday my fic will come\" request.  I've asked for it every Yuletide I've signed up for, and I haven't gotten it yet, but I still want it!

I love Tony and Maya. I love them separately as characters, and I love them together as a \"you say you're not in love but we know you really are\" couple. I'm not a big shipper, but this is the big exception -- I think they eventually married each other and lived happily ever after. So if you like to write shippy stories, go for it! (Please no explicit sex, though -- G or PG rating would be great.) On the other hand, I also think it took them a long time to get there, so a story that doesn't focus on them as a couple works, too -- I love genfic, and I'm primarily a gen writer myself. Some ideas: Tony and Maya's first meeting; Moonbase Alpha coming across something from Psychon civilization; or maybe a missing scene or a tag around one or more broadcast episodes? Really, just feel free to explore whatever you find interesting about these characters.

If you want some inspiration, see this shippy fanvid, which shows off all the wonderful '70s cheesiness of Maya's transformations to boot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8acdNWKk0b0

The Good Place (TV) 
Real Eleanor Shellstrop | Vicki

I love this show for how innovative it is, and how it is constantly surprising me with where it goes.   I also adore all the characters, but it's Vicky that I particularly want to read about.   She's a diva demon!  What was her life like in The Bad Place?   Did she feel that she got the respect she deserved there?  (I'm guessing no . . . )  How did Michael talk her into joining his scheme?   Has she ever been to Earth, and if so, what did she do there?   

I will be keeping up with canon, so don't worry about spoilers.  Also, don't worry if something crazy happens over the next few months that completely josses your fic.   (I mean, imagine if you'd started writing about Real Eleanor last season?)  I'd prefer it if you can keep the same tone as the canon; while passing mentions of physical torture are fine, please don't dwell on the details, or get too dark.   Crack!fic is welcome if your muse wants to go there.  Feel free to bring in other characters if you like as long as the focus remains on Vicky.  (P.S. -- whoever created this AO3 tag spelled her name \"Vicki,\" but I think it's officially spelled \"Vicky.\"  But I don't have a strong preference on the spelling, so you can choose.)

Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (1969) 
Marty Hopkirk

This show is a nostalgic favorite of mine.  I asked for Marty because to me Marty is what makes this show -- how he's a ghost but forgets sometimes, how he still has this great relationship with Jeff, how he's nervous and neurotic (especially about other ghosts), and how he's actually surprisingly smart and a good detective. Feel free to write about just him, or bring in Jeff and/or Jeannie.  I'd love some genfic here, in the vein of an unbroadcast story, but if you really like shipping then some Marty/Jeannie would be nice -- however I do see Marty as faithful to his widow, so please don't pair him with anyone else. If you want some ideas to start you off, how about: Marty on Halloween; Marty and Jeff have a fight about who's the better detective; or Jeff has to somehow rescue Marty (for a change).

I'm not looking for crossovers, having been burned on too many Stargate fics that lug in my beloved character just for a joke about duct tape. Not that I have anything against jokes about duct tape! Quite the contrary.

(Although if you are that inexplicable person who agrees with me that the MacGyver characters would map amazingly onto John Le Carre's Karla trilogy, do feel free to write that.)

Dislike:

Feel free to include hanky-panky if that floats your boat, but honestly, I’m just not that interested in the finer details of plumbing. Fade to black is my preferred style.

Things I’d like to see:

Mac, of course. And I'd prefer at least one other person from the show. There’s this idea that MacGyver’s a heroic loner, and I’ve never agreed with that; even in episodes without the other regulars, he’s always friendly and looking for someone to bond with.

That’s it. I’d hate to dissuade any possible MacGyver fanfiction on the grounds of being too specific.

Sort the songs into proper chronological order, tell the bits of narrative that come in between, and bob’s your uncle!

19th Century CE Danish Literature RPF 
Hans Christian Andersen (19th Century CE Danish Literature RPF)

MY AWKWARD LOVE, Andersen. He's a desperate wretched mess. I love him. I'll flail for nine straight hours about my feelings for him if anyone's willing to listen, but I'll spare you most of it here. Short version: I wish he'd lived in a kinder time that allowed him to be happier, but I'm glad he had at least a few little chances at happiness even though they didn't last. Please write me anything you've got in you to write for him, I will love it. Anything about the autobiographical nature of a lot of his stories. Anything about his dirty diary full of black crosses and his difficult feelings regarding sex. Anything you want.

ODAO extra characters I wanted to nominate but couldn't figure out how to corral into a single sensible fandom name, if any of these relationships appeal:

Harald Scharff: handsome principal ballet dancer with the Royal Danish Theatre. From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Scharff\">his Wikipedia page</a>:

&nbsp;

  <i>In his diary entry for 2 January 1862, Andersen noted that Scharff \"bounded up to me; threw himself round my neck and kissed me!\" In other entries for January 1862, he described Scharff as \"deeply devoted… very intimate… ardent and loving\". In February, the poet observed that Scharff was \"intimate and communicative\" and in March he noted \"a visit from Scharff... exchanged with him all the little secrets of the heart; I long for him daily.\" Later in March he wrote, \"Scharff very loving... I gave him my picture.\" Scharff gave a silver toothbrush engraved with his name and the date to Andersen on his 57th birthday. In the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered a full-blown love affair that brought Andersen \"joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness.\" He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary for March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his \"erotic period\".</i>

&nbsp;

Big age difference, affectionate lovers, and a handsome ballet dancer. It is everything I love. Andersen's story <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman_(fairy_tale)\">The Snowman</a> is supposedly about his pining for Scharff.

Jenny Lind: opera singer Andersen became infatuated with and proposed to. From Wikipedia:

&nbsp;

  <i>One of his stories, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightingale_(fairy_tale)\">The Nightingale</a>\", was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\". Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: \"farewell ...

Charles Dickens: Andersen was a big fan of Dickens (after their first meeting he wrote in his diary \"I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most\") and they became friends, but then OOPS disaster a decade later when Dickens invited Andersen to stay at his home for a short while and Andersen just kind of missed/ignored all the hints that he should leave for five endless weeks. When he finally went home, Dickens totally ghosted him and poor old Andersen couldn't understand why his letters weren't being answered any more. <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2014/10/01/dirtbag-hans-christian-andersen-2\">This is my favourite account of that outstayed welcome</a>, but it would be great to see something slightly less flippant. Bonus points for showing Dickens getting really aggravated by it all, because I don't like Dickens :P

DNW: Andersen-bashing of any kind. I know he was often peculiar and annoying and didn't really have a brilliant understanding of when people were done with him getting in their way, but that's really not what I'd like to read about unless it's done with a bit of compassion. (Subjective, I know - anon commenting is allowed on my DW if you've got any questions.)

И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский | Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Ballets Russes RPF), Серге́й Па́влович Дя́гилев | Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev (Ballets Russes RPF), Ва́цлав Фоми́ч Нижи́нский | Vaslav Nijinsky (Ballets Russes RPF)

I don't even know where to begin. I would love to read ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING about any of these guys in whatever combination and setting you want.

Something about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/10061574/The-Rite-of-Spring-1913-Why-did-it-provoke-a-riot.html\">the Paris riot</a>? <i>The conductor of the premiere, Pierre Monteux, was told by one of his double-bass players that \"many a gentleman's shiny top hat or soft fedora was ignominiously pulled down by an opponent over his eyes and ears, and canes were brandished like menacing implements of combat all over the theatre\"</i> is just the best and most beautiful report of a riot imaginable. This whole thing is a bit ridiculous and a lot fascinating and weirdly thrilling. Why don't we get riots over ballet and classical music any more? (Note: I know the stories about that night are all exaggerated to hell, but I don't care - go as ott or as realistic as you like. Legend and truth are both as good as each other sometimes.)

Or something more focused on the music and dance with Stravinsky and/or Nijinsky, and the sort of symbiosis of creator/performer needed to make all these glorious things possible. Or the physical difficulties of ballet... I would happily read a 1000 word intricately detailed description of a single leap or turn if that's what you wanted to write. Or something about the changing state of politics and society and fashions at the time they were all working. Diaghilev's background, like his love of music and how he wasn't good enough to make a career of it - how much lingering frustration was there about all that? How did it affect the work he ended up doing later in the theatre, or his relationship with brilliant Stravinsky? Diaghilev and Nijinsky were lovers, how did that come about? They didn't stay happy, but were they happy for a while? Or was their relationship purely physical?

DNW: focus on Nijinsky's deteriorating mental health, if you're writing about him. Of course don't avoid the topic completely if you want to include it, just please don't have that as the main focus and please nothing about his time in asylums. (Recommend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/831382.The_Diary_of_Vaslav_Nijinsky\">The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky</a>, but it's incredibly upsetting and difficult to read.)

Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF 
Elsie Wright (Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF), Frances Griffiths (Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF)

I don't know why I've never thought of Cottingley Fairies fic before but w o w it's lodged in my head and there's no shifting it now! I've loved this story my entire life. I would love to see anything at all about Elsie and Frances learning about photography, their games, what made them pretend it was all real, how they felt when it all took off and ran away with itself - were they scared about being found out? Just elated that they had such a wonderful secret? Lots of things all at once? Early photography and film is a HUGE passion of mine and I feel a bit silly and reverant about it all, I don't like the tendency to get a bit ha-ha about people being taken in by something that seems so sweetly ridiculous now (even though yes there's absolutely something glorious about a couple of little girls fooling some of the best minds of the era for so long). I'm fascinated by this weird liminal time of people still figuring out this relatively new technology and what to feel about it all. I'm sure I would have been taken in as well. I WANT TO BELIEVE. Anyway - fairy hoax, children's games, young girls fooling smart old men, this sense of inexplicable magic coming to life on glass plates, secrets, I am here for any of it. I didn't add Arthur Conan Doyle to my requests because I'm mostly interested in the girls' stories, but absolutely do include him if you like.

Another angle - what if the pictures actually weren't a hoax? Elsie and Frances find real live fairies at the bottom of their garden and take their pictures... what then? Are they nice Disney type fairies who just want to play? Or are they the kind of fairies who demand payment for anything you take from them? Fairy stories always scared the hell out of me way more than ghosts and monsters so it would be great to read some kind of fairytale-horror take on all of this, especially because the pictures are so incredibly lovely. Turn the whole thing upside down.

Kingsman (Movies) RPF 

I was going to narrow this down to just Mark/Colin, but I've been having so much fun with the Golden Circle press tour interviews and I'm kind of in love with all of them. Some ideas below, but feel free to mix and match anyone from the tagset if you prefer.

Potential pairings, &amp; and / both welcome:

* Mark/Colin is the big one with the most history to mine, but really any combination of Colin &amp; Mark &amp; Taron is GOLD (especially with Mark's comments about Harry, Merlin &amp; Eggsy being a family). Mark and Colin working together so often. That thing Mark said about seeing Colin on stage in Another Country and how it made him want to act. Some kind of conversation between reading the script and shooting about whether Harry/Merlin is a real thing, or teasing about why the hell Colin decided to play Harry with such ridiculous bedroom eyes all the damn time. Colin and Mark and the crossover between mentors and friends to Taron. Taron's mum fancying Mark and Colin getting fake-pissy about it. Colin trying on Elton John's costume and the others taking blackmail photos. Anything from friendship to the most explicit filth, please and thank you.
* Taron/Channing and the sex toys prank war, what was that all about? Was anyone else in on it or a victim of it? I love Channing's excitement about all of this and how open he is about being a huge fanboy of the first film. A big lovefest of \"I LOVE KINGSMAN\" - \"OK BUT I LOVE HAIL CAESAR SO MUCH\" - \"YEAH BUT YOU'RE ELTON JOHN NOW\" - \"I KNOW BUT YOU WERE SO GOOD IN FOXCATCHER AND THE EAGLE IS AMAZING AND I MADE COLIN WATCH STEP UP AND HE LOVED IT\" - \"WOW OK THANKS\" mutual fanboying would be beautiful.
* Colin/Channing for absolutely no reason other than the idea of it makes me very happy. Ships have sailed on much less.
* Sophie/Sofia mmmaybe getting salty together about the big Boys' Club/sausage fest these sets must have been (I genuinely love these films, but let's be real)
* Pedro/Halle because they were a total delight in every interview together and hearts came streaming out of my eyes.
* Taron/Colin/Pedro since Taron keeps insisting on talking about that jealousy photo in every single interview.

Or mix it up! I have no real strict (friend)ship affiliation, so if you want to throw your favourites together and see what happens I'll honestly love anything at all. I will be surfing this goodwill wave for years yet, I adore this entire bunch and just really enjoy seeing people's takes on them.

(DNW: wife and girlfriend bashing if there's romance/smut, please just go with happy polyamory.)

Mongol Empire RPF 
Khutulun (Mongol Empire RPF)

I only have one real prompt, and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/wrestler-princess\">this article in Lapham's Quarterly</a> explains it better than I can:

\"With her success in battle and in sports, Khutulun refused to marry unless a man could first defeat her in wrestling. Many men came forward to try, but none succeeded. Her parents became anxious for her to marry. According to Marco Polo, a particularly desirable bachelor prince presented himself around 1280. Most opponents wagered ten horses, or at the most a hundred, to compete against her. This unnamed bachelor wagered a thousand horses, and Khutulun's parents pleaded with her to take a fall and let him win.

An excited crowd gathered for the match. In the desire to please her parents Khutulun agreed to let the prince win. In the rush of competitive excitement as she stepped forward to face her rival, however, her filial resolve to please her parents melted. She grabbed her opponent by the arms, and found him to be more formidable than her usual challengers. He struggled against her, and they pushed this way and that, but she could not submit and allow herself to be thrown. The match continued for an agonizing long time with neither able to dominate. Finally, in a great surge of energy Khutlun threw him to the ground. She not only defeated but humiliated him, and he disappeared, leaving behind the additional thousand horses for her herd but having shattered her parents' hopes of marrying her to a worthy suitor.\"

I just really really want to hear more about this strong brilliant defiant warrior princess and the billion horses she won from all the humiliated suitors she crushed in wrestling matches. This is the greatest thing. I'd love to read more about her in war and her place in her family as well, any kind of story you want because there's not a great deal of information out there and she's endlessly fascinating - but \"horse hoarding wrestling champ\" is absolutely my favourite part.

Pre-Raphaelite Models RPF 
Effie Gray (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Elizabeth Siddal (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Jane Morris (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Marie Spartali Stillman (Pre-Raphaelite RPF)

I remember being so fascinated when I was little by how I could recognise the same faces over and over in different paintings, and it grew into a bit of an obsession with artists' models, particularly the women in so much of the Pre-Raphaelite art. When I started reading up on them it all shifted from the initial \"Alexa is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life omg\" to wanting to know everything about them and their wishes and achievements and everything else, rather than only knowing them from the way their lives slotted into the guys'. They're famous worldwide nearly to the point of being mythical (Lizzie's hair growing after death to fill her coffin!) but it's shallow, it's almost entirely because of their beauty. There must be millions of people who could recognise their faces but don't know their names. There's so much more to explore. I would honestly love to read anything about any of them so if you've got a particular favourite and something you want to say about her then please do, but some possible starting off points:

* Marie Spartali Stillman and Lizzie Siddal as artists. The whole act of creation and the drive behind it. Lizzie's much less idealised self-portraits vs other people's portraits of her.
* How completely Jane reinvented herself as soon as she had the means.
* Effie's determination and courage during the mess of her marriage annulment. Her maternal sort of relationship with Sophy.
* I seriously cannot overstate how obsessed I am with long hair. I would be absolutely ok with just a 1000 word description of someone washing or brushing this thigh-length mass of beautiful endless curls. SWOON.
* The strange dichotomy of being a dressmaker or charwoman or whatever but seeing your face in these gloriously beautiful celebrated paintings. How seeing that changes your perspective on everyday life, if it does at all.
* Artist modelling being only half a step up from prostitution. Does that make anyone's decision to do it more difficult, or does it change anything for them outside of the studio? Some of them married famous artists and/or came from higher class families, but Alexa, Fanny C, and Fanny E were all working class women, and Fanny E was Jamaican. How different was it for them vs Marie or the Grays?

* Or go totally off in some other AU direction if that's your thing and include the whole group. Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies this up, or put them in the middle of the Martians attack from The War of the Worlds, or make them meet Dracula. Shove them all together in a house and see what happens. Would they be friends? Or something about the characters from the paintings, instead of the women themselves. Anything!

DNW: a primary focus on Rossetti/Millais/etc with the women added in around the edges, I really want the women to be the centre of it in whatever way that is (but absolutely include anyone you like around them). And mentions are fine, but please not a whole thing solely about Sophy's anorexia.

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 
Ralph Lanyon, Laurie Odell

Things I tend to like: introspective character studies and backstories, complex and intense relationships, hurt/comfort, humor and clever dialogue (when appropriate), historical detail, characters undergoing some sort of emotional journey or transformation throughout the story, characters grappling with their feelings or with difficult situations, quiet expressions of intimacy or vulnerability. 

Things I'd prefer not to read: rape, crack/intentional OOC, major character deaths (unless they happened in canon), AUs (with the exception of canon-divergence/\"what if\" scenarios). 

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I would love a post-canon wartime story about these characters. I am interested in seeing how Ralph and Laurie's relationship progresses throughout the war and how they navigate challenges of wartime and being part of gay society, and how their attitudes, worldviews, and prejudices may evolve as well. Ralph particularly is such an incredibly compelling character to me, with all his innumerable facets and flaws, and anything that dives into his psyche or reveals something about his character or his past would also be wonderful to read. Feel free to incorporate additional characters, especially Alec or any of the Bridstow crowd.

My only hardline requests are 1) please no depressing endings (though moderate amounts of angst with a happy/hopeful ending is fine) and 2) don't break up Ralph and Laurie, or make either of them unfaithful to each other. I admit that I am a deeply hopeless romantic/optimist when it comes to these characters - not that I expect everything to be sunshine and roses for them, but I do want them to find some lasting degree of happiness and stability together, even if there might be some intermittent angst and conflict in their lives. 

Possible ideas:
- Ralph fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic. How has his self-image changed since being commissioned again and starting a relationship with Laurie? Or Ralph getting imprisoned in a POW camp and escaping somehow.
- Ralph and Laurie exchanging letters throughout the war (and couching their feelings in coded language).
- Laurie finding out something significant about Ralph's past - his childhood, family, previous relationships, whatever he did after school instead of going \"straight to Southampton\" (sex work tends to be a common theory, though ymmv of course), etc. Or Ralph is confronted by someone from his past, and he and Laurie have to deal with the consequences.
- This one I'll throw in for its comedic (and/or dramatic) potential: Ralph and Laurie running into Charles Fosticue (Laurie's ex-boyfriend from Oxford) at a party. (Possible opportunity for bitchy!Laurie and proprietary!Ralph?) Or any story about Ralph and Laurie brushing up against the rest of the Bridstow queer scene, and how its members perceive them as individuals and as a couple. (I've always wanted to know the gossips' reactions to Ralph throwing Bunny over for Laurie, and what are the \"entre nous\" rumors circulating about Ralph?)

Secret History - Donna Tartt 
Francis Abernathy, Henry Winter, Camilla Macaulay, Charles Macaulay

Things I tend to like: introspective character studies and backstories, complex and intense relationships, hurt/comfort, humor and clever dialogue (when appropriate), historical detail, characters undergoing some sort of emotional journey or transformation throughout the story, characters grappling with their feelings or with difficult situations, quiet expressions of intimacy or vulnerability. 

Things I'd prefer not to read: rape, crack/intentional OOC, major character deaths (unless they happened in canon), AUs (with the exception of canon-divergence/\"what if\" scenarios). 

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I'd like any story that explores the dynamics between these characters (horribly dysfunctional and codependent that they are). You can either include all of these characters or just focus on two or three if you wish. Of the four Francis is my favorite, so alternatively I'd take a character piece about him or his relationships. In terms of romantic pairings I tend to be interested in Francis/Charles, Francis/Henry, Henry/Camilla, or of course the quadrangle of Henry/Camilla/Charles/Francis, but I'd be fine with a gen/friendship story as well. I'd prefer not to have a story centered specifically around romantic Charles/Camilla, though I'm not asking you to ignore the incestuous aspect of their relationship (just not to focus completely on it).

My other main request is not to romanticize these characters overmuch (unlike Richard!) - I've always viewed them as fascinating, vulnerable but deeply selfish people who are probably not capable of having any sort of functional or healthy relationships, and yet are still somehow horridly attached to each other. For this fandom I am perfectly okay with angst, violence, darker interpretations, or unhappy/bittersweet endings, as befitting the tone of the novel (or lighter stories with an undercurrent of darkness that take place before everything utterly goes to shit). 

Possible ideas:
- What actually happened during the bacchanal. The novel leaves the somewhat mystical elements up to interpretation (did they really see Dionysus?), and of course there's Henry's infamous line about there being a \"certain carnal element to the proceedings.\"
- An AU where the four of them successfully manage to flee the country, but their lives and relationships still deteriorate, albeit in different ways.
- Conversely, an AU where the murders are discovered (perhaps Julian turns them in?), and the fallout that ensues.
- A post-canon story with Francis, Charles, and Camilla meeting up years later, their lives by now greatly diverged, but unresolved feelings still linger.
- A pre-canon slice of life story, or a \"missing moment\" within the book.

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I don't have really any specifications for this one story-wise - this was such an utterly fun, clever book that so deftly handles racial and gender politics of the period, and I would happily read just about any story about the further magical adventures of these characters. I loved the Prunella/Zacharias romance in the book but I'd be content with a gen story about either character as well. 

Possible ideas:
- Prunella's career as Sorceress - either her nascent career, or several years onward.
- Zacharias continuing to pursue social reform efforts and Fighting The Establishment.
- Zacharias searches for his parents, and/or Prunella learns more about her mother.
- Prunella and Zacharias's wedding - or the wedding night.
- A crossover with the Jane Austen novel of your choice (perhaps taking place when Prunella is out trying to land a suitor and enter society?).

The Evil Within (Video Game) 
Sebastian Castellanos

I love all the chars and themes in TEW, from the gory and dark and angsty to more mundane day-to-day interactions of the characters pre or post game. Whether it's supernatural horror stuff or cop &amp; detective stuff, this game really has a lot of themes I love.
I like a lot of ships in this game, bonus points if Seb is always begrudgingly putting up with someone else's overtures.

My favorite ship is Sebastian/Tatiana, especially with Tatiana being pushy and forward to Sebastian trying to \"help\" and him being really awkward. If there is Joseph/Sebastian or Juli/Sebastian, I would prefer it one-sided AT Seb, with their feelings not being reciprocated or situations falling into non-con territory. Pining is great! Anything with Ruvik treating Seb as an object or toy in either a sexual or non context is wonderful. Hassling by the monsters is great (Keeper, Sadist). Or any number of chars thrown together with Seb, I'm not so picky. I love the upgrade chair and all that it entails. I also do enjoy Seb in his canon ship with his wife Myra, though I would prefer a story involving her to also include angst or detail about their falling out or the potential lies between them.

I love stuff with fighting and action, blood and angst. I also like ridiculous scenarios or funny or interesting character interactions that don't appear in canon. I also love detective work or mysterious stuff, day-to-day of the KCPD or even the monsters.

The sequel will release after the close of signups, and I have no idea what will be included in it. It is entirely fine to ignore the second game and its canon entirely, and focus on the first game. Or, if there are things in the second game that inspire or entertain, as long as they fall within my general preferences that's totally fine with me!
Possible ideas:
- Seb fighting for his life in STEM and against monsters to good or bad end
- Post-game, Seb unsure of his sanity or if the events of TEW occurred, falling into destructive habits
- Pre-game detective adventures with Seb and any of the KCPD characters
- A new case or adventure for Sebastian as KCPD or after being fired to embark upon or investigate

Despite my best efforts, Shuu ended up my favorite, and I especially love the brutally dark ideas in his story. Considering it's all in canon: dark fic, gore, and character death are all fine. Delving into Shuu's sexual proclivities with an obsessive or dark bent is also totally fine, but not necessary.

Possible ideas:

- Shuu doing experiments in current time while thinking about interactions with Ryuuji (whether fluffy or dark)

- Shuu experimenting on or obsessing over Ryouta

- Shuu's experiences interacting with Hiyoko in the original endings, ultimately leading to her decapitation

- Shuu/Hiyoko's head in jar go on an adventure?

-Shuu interacting with any other cast members in a way that makes them uncomfortable or creeped

-A typical day in the life of Shuu?

Six of Crows Series - Leigh Bardugo 
Jesper Fahey, Wylan Van Eck

\"i love six of crows and the crooked kingdom, but i wasn’t super satisfied with some aspects of his character development, particularly in the crooked kingdoms. (note: this prompt contains spoilers for the crooked kingdom.) in particular, i wasn’t happy with the fact that his gambling addiction – a very real problem faced by millions of people – was given a supernatural explanation. i also wasn’t happy with how the solution in a crooked kingdom to his gambling addiction was “well wylan controls his money”. i’d love to see fic that really dealt with those aspects of his character. 

however, i understand that gambling addiction is a very serious issue and that a writer for a variety of reasons might not feel comfortable writing about those series. if this is the case – and as a writer you don’t want to pick a different fandom – i’ve also included some lighter, extra prompts. 

prompts: 

* modern AU: what would jesper look like in a modern universe, where he doesn’t have his grisha powers and addiction is understood as a disease? i’d love a fic that was set with him in rehab. he could already be in a relationship with wylan or meet wylan as part of his road to recovery. bonus points for if jesper’s parents play a large role in the narrative.
*  post-canon fic: in the end of six of crows, his situation with wylan is described as wylan gives him “some extra money to manage” and that he has started to invest money instead of gambling. this seems like it might be constraining for jesper, who is used to living alone and (mis)managing his own money. how does he respond to having so much money? how does investing compare to gambling for him? 

i understand that for any number of reasons prompts that touch on gambling and gambling addiction might not make a good prompt for yuletide. other lighter prompts: 

* jesper describes wylan as a prince who has found himself in the wrong story. i’d love a fairytale AU where wylan is a prince and jesper is a handsome thief / knight in shining armor / any other trope of your choosing.
* if you want something more porn-y, i really like the idea of jesper and wylan playing The Princess and the Barbarian. your choice for who is the princess and who is the barbarian (and they could switch!) 

&nbsp;

want: as much as i love wylan i'd love something that was more jesper-centric since i feel like his perspective on things got sortta short-changed at the end of the book; i'd love to see more of jesper's dad and his mom (if in an AU) 

prefer no: woobification of either jesper or wylan

Agatha Wellbelove

I'd really like a fic from Agatha's perspective set after the events of the book. How is she adjusting to life in California? How is she adjusting to life without magic? Something introspective and character-driven would be great. 

would like: anything that deals with her relationship with her family; any exploration of Agatha's sexuality (or lackthereof) - all headcanons for sexuality / romantic interests for Agatha are great 

prefer no: mentions of baz or simon are fine but i don't want thoughts of them to dominate the narrative

Oglaf (Webcomic) 
Greir (Oglaf), Navaan (Oglaf)

I really loved the interaction these two had when they needed to team up against the Fun God and how their contrasting styles somehow managed to combine to get results, and I would love to see more of that. Maybe the lesbian pirates steal something Greir was hired to guard and only Navaan can help her get it back, possibly with undercover-as-a-couple shenanigans that turn into something real. Or maybe Navaan is the one who steals the thing from Greir just because she wants to see what Greir will do to get it back. Or maybe Navaan needs Greir's help to escape villagers who are angry about the results of her fake doctor business. Or maybe instead of the usual fuck-or-die trope, Greir finds herself stuck in a have-fun-or-die situation and only Navaan has a chance of getting her to crack a smile. Or just give me lots of chasing and fighting and sexual tension that gets resolved with acrobatic kissing and inappropriate use of fake death pellets. Or Greir could introduce Navaan to the Snow Queen for some reason that made sense at the time but now seems like it may have been a really bad idea because Navaan has broken out her fruit viking seduction costume and there are frozen bananas everywhere. Or whatever else you can think of.

Feel free to include whatever other canon characters you want for supporting roles in the story or make up OCs. In terms of ships, I'd be equally happy with either gen or Greir/Navaan. Greir/Navaan/Snow Queen would be good too but is in no way expected or required.

Beat the Devil (1953) 
Gwendolen Chelm, Maria Dannreuther

These two have such an interesting relationship. They kind of start out scamming each other in their separate ways, and then in short order both want to steal each other's husbands, yet there never seems to be any enmity between them, and they might even be some sort of actual friends by the end of the movie. I would love to see any kind of missing scenes from the movie where it is just the two of them together, either wandering around town entertaining themselves while waiting for the ship to be ready, or when they think Dan is dead, or on the ship, or after they've been \"shipwrecked\" and taken into custody, or whenever. Gwendolen is prone to compulsive lying/making up stories, so what kind of stories does she make up about herself and Maria when they're alone? Or, what happens after the end of the movie? What happens after Harry sends for Gwendolen to join him in Africa? Does she go join him? Does Maria go join him? Do Gewndolen and Maria work out some kind of spouse swapping deal? Do they drag their husbands into some kind of poly relationship? Do they ditch the men and run off together as either friends or lovers? Dan and Harry have both been mistakenly thought to be dead, so do Gewndolen and/or Maria ever end up being mistaken for dead at some point in the future, either accidentally or on purpose?

Feel free to include whatever other canon characters you want or make up OCs for supporting roles in the story. Gen, femslash, or any het or poly combinations involving Gwendolen, Maria, Dan and/or Harry are equally fine.

Night at the Museum (Movies) 
Tilly (Night at the Museum)

I love Tilly and would love to see anything about what she was doing during the time-skip at the end of the movie or further into the future. How does she handle going from a boring job where she sits in a little booth all night to a job where she's dealing with magic and wonder and chaotic all night parties, all while officially she's still supposed to be sitting in that little booth all night? Is there any part of the museum that she especially loves or hates when it comes to life? What kind of fun or trouble does she have during the exhibits' world tour at the end of Secret of the Tomb? Does she keep in touch with Larry to get advice and/or complain about the latest magical shenanigans she has had to clean up after? Does Tilly ever talk Ahkmenrah and/or Lancelot into letting her have swords and teaching her how to use them? I ship Laaa/Tilly and would love to see a post-canon story about how they handled a relationship involving a language barrier and a species barrier. Bonus points for body-positivity and Laaa thinking that Tilly looks like a fertility goddess. Does Tilly ever get to celebrate any holidays with the exhibits, either in London, in New York, or anywhere else along the tour? Would the Tablet's powers do anything to a living person who was dressed up as somebody/something else, such as a person in a Halloween costume or dressed as Santa Claus or whatever, and how would Tilly deal with the results?

Feel free to include whatever other major or minor canon characters you want, whether they're in the tag set or not, because they're all entertaining, or make up OCs to fill supporting roles. As I said above, I ship Tilly/Laaa. Any ships between whatever supporting characters you decide to include are fine too as long as they aren't the main focus of the story.

Blood Drive (TV) 
Julian Slink, Grace d'Argento

Some of my favorite moments in canon are the interactions between Grace and Slink, especially times like the interrogation in \"The Fucking Dead\" and their whole time together in the bar in \"Fistful of Blood\" when Slink can't just brain-bomb shock Grace into submission, because they're both so driven to get what they want and are ready to break out the violence with little provocation, and there's no telling what they might do to each other or any bystanders. I love how they're just so opposed to each other both for legitimate and for very petty reasons and how, despite everything Slink has done, Grace isn't afraid of him and isn't even impressed.

Did they interact at all in the year between when Grace agreed to join the Blood Drive and when the main race takes place? Were there qualifying races Grace had to drive in before the main event? Did Slink just show up to annoy her from time to time to make sure his \"hand-picked battle bitch\" would be ready to put on a good show when the time came? I would also love to see missing scenes from any point in canon, maybe from the two hour time-skip between the beginning of their \"twenty questions for twenty punches\" game and Slink telling Grace that her life reads like a depressing country song, or Grace having to put up with Slink as a road trip companion between episodes 10+11 or 12+13. Or insert an extra leg of the race where they had to face another instance of random sci-fi/horror tropes like giant mutant insects, ghosts or other supernatural creatures, time loops, time travel, dealing with (un)natural disasters, or whatever else you can think of. I'd also love to see something post-canon where they both somehow survive, because of course they would have if the show had gotten a second season. If they met up again after destroying Heart Tower, how would their goals have shifted? Would they try even harder to kill each other because they don't have any reason to hold back anymore, or would they have enough built up grudging respect for each other to team up again to go rescue Arthur, or would their reactions be something else entirely?

Feel free to include whatever other major or minor canon characters you want, whether they're in the tag set or not, because they're all entertaining, or make up OCs to fill supporting roles. I'd prefer Grace and Slink's relationship remain gen, with no sex/romance. For potential background ships, I like Slink/Rasher, Grace/Arthur, Grace/Carolina, Grace/Domi, Aki/Christopher, Arthur/Christopher, and Domi/Cliff.

[Please could you avoid (please apply this list to all my requests - thanks!) mpreg, BDSM, A/B/O, soulmate AUs (and any variation along the identifying-marks line), any sort of non-canon supernatural AU, bodyswap, and animal cruelty, suffering, or endangerment of any kind. I'm fully up for explicit sex, but I'd rather not receive a PWP - I like a bit of dialogue and rambling stream-of-consciousness. As you'll see from my individual requests, I tend to prefer canon-era fics or ones which more or less fit into the existing universe, rather than modern-day AUs or other transpositions.] 

I'd really appreciate you sticking to canon-era for this fandom. I'd love to read more about their first meeting and how their working/personal relationship develops, or more about their reunion if you choose to give them one (character death okay in this fandom, as long as it's heavy on the angst, because I love to suffer). How do they get to know each other again post-war? Do they grow old together? I'd prefer their relationship to be romantic rather than platonic, even if they don't get round to consummating it or acknowledging it to each other. 

In this fandom, I particularly like: British stiff-upper-lipness/emotional constipation, the constant threat of mortality throwing ~feelings into sharp relief, coping with a noticeable age difference and with the gulf in their ranks, making the most of moments of peace, Tom Hardy-esque grunting, lots of rich historical detail, having to keep their relationship secret. I also love it when there's a dog of some description for Farrier to be affectionate towards.

Just one small personal preference in terms of style in this fandom: please avoid writing in Scots dialect when writing Collins' voice - I find it a bit distracting. Thank you!

Pride (2014) 
Cliff (Pride)

I'd love to read more about Cliff's quiet exploration of his sexuality after attending Pride - doesn't need to be about finding a relationship necessarily; it could just be about finding like-minded people and the grief of finding them so late in life, and so far away. Alternatively, you could explore the trajectory of his life in the Dulais valley before the events of the movie - the death of his brother, his career in the pits, the pain of never quite fitting in, and the contrast between the shy bookish man and the screaming, passionate striker. The more Welsh-ness the better! Any and all other characters very welcome (especially Dai, Hefina, and Gethin!) but I'd love for the main focus to be Cliff.

Colditz (1972) 
Horst Mohn, Simon Carter

I'd really like to read a post-war fic in this fandom, which explores the aftermath of captivity, or of having been crowded together, jailers and prisoners cheek-by-jowl, for so long. Do the prisoners struggle with a sense of guilt at having been \"out of it\"? Do the jailers reevaluate their perspective or feel any remorse? 

I'd love to read a post-war encounter between Mohn and Carter which explores the strange dynamic between them. I don't mind whether you make Mohn's obsession with Simon sexual or not, but I'd rather it not be reciprocated if so. Or you could write a Simon post-war gen story: I'd love to read more about his reintegration into Cathy's family, and whether the tensions that were there before the war remain. And how does he deal with his lingering disability?

In the Flesh (TV) 
Rick Macy, Kieren Walker

I'd love to see any scenes in Rick and Kieren's friendship/relationship before canon - I'd rather not receive a story set after the Rising or containing any canon divergence AUs where Rick survives.

Things I'd like: teenage boys being both horny and emotionally constipated, abortive attempts to talk about feelings, lots of details about growing up in a small Lancashire town, dealing with parental surveillance and disapproval, Rick's internalised homophobia and struggle to reconcile his laddish reputation with his relationship with Kieren, discussion of plans for the future. Although I'd be fine with sexual intimacy, I'd like non-touching or almost-touching (and the accompanying yearning and sexual frustration) even more.

Mercy Street (TV) 
Emma Green, Henry Hopkins

My greatest wish in this fandom is a post-war fic about their marriage which deals with Emma's ostracisation from her family, and her bumpy integration into whatever northern community you decide Henry's from. How does she deal with being a lowly chaplain's wife? How does she deal with the jealousy of northern girls who believe she's stolen Henry? How does she win the community over to the idea of having a southern belle in their midst? Or you could go in another direction - perhaps they move west to establish a church in a pioneer community, or they stay in the South doing Freedmen's Bureau-type work with emancipated people. As long as they are together and learning to be happy and in love. 

I'd love to see the importance and depth of Henry's faith to every part of his life (and maybe how the war has tested that faith), and to see him still dealing with the fallout of the murder he committed, and blaming any difficulties his new family encounters on himself. I'd also love to see him coming out of his shell a little, and Emma teaching him how to enjoy life a bit more with her natural vivacity. I also absolutely love awkward fumbling wedding-night encounters, please and thank you.

Taboo (TV 2017) 
James Delaney, Michael Godfrey

I'd most like to read some Godfrey-centric fic in this fandom. Anything about his life at the seminary and the development of his hopeless/helpless love for James, about how the molly-house offers him a contingent sort of liberation (even a chance to explore what we would now call gender dysphoria?), about his conflicted feelings towards the EIC, about his life aboard the ship as he and the gang set sail for the Azores. 

Alternatively, I would also love to read a growing closeness between James and Godfrey - my personal headcanon is that James is straight, so I'd love a story where James falls for a Godfrey who's embraced his identity as a woman. I've used male pronouns throughout this request but please feel free to play around with that if you do end up exploring Godfrey's gender identity. 

I love: the contrast between James' arrogant chill and Godfrey's state of constant panic, James calling Godfrey \"Godders\", reminders of their shared adolescence, explorations of the fluidity and constructedness of gender, Godfrey's hero-worship of James, lots of detail about the feeling and materiality of clothing, and about the muck and grime of London or life aboard ship.

Chalion Saga - Lois McMaster Bujold 
Penric kin Jurald, Desdemona (Chalion)

Okay so. Pen. And Desdemona. &lt;3____________&lt;3 It is really, really striking to me how much their story in Penric and the Demon is structured as a romance, and I would really, really love to read a further exploration of that. If you'd rather keep things non-explicit, I'd be delighted by more exploration of things Pen does to give gifts to Desdemona--and what it's like when Desdemona wants to do nice things for Pen in return.

If you're open to the sexy options, oh my god, SO MANY POSSIBILITIES?! Inevitably, there's a first time when Pen jerks off knowing he has Desdemona watching--does that become a gift of pleasure he gives her? Does she have advice for him on how to make it better? Does Desdemona coach him through his first time with a woman? Does he try having sex with a guy who Desdemona likes the looks of? And so on, and on, and on. I would love ANYTHING in that line, omfg.

Punic Wars RPF 
Hannibal Barca (Punic Wars RPF)

Hannibal is THE historical bae for me. He was such a fascinating (and tragic) figure, and yet we know so little about him besides his military exploits. What we do know about him as a person is intriguing—he was a nerd who wrote books in Greek, spoke multiple languages, allegedly went around in multiple wigs/disguises among his own army, could be both ruthlessly pragmatic and yet deeply honourable and respectful to his enemies, and on top of everything was apparently the snarkiest person ever (from the few lines of reported dialogue in Livy).

I would love a fic that explores these lesser-known aspects of Hannibal's character. Bonus points if you manage to make it light-hearted and humorous, since his life was, you know, already so depressing. (That being said, there is a truly frustrating dearth of Hannibal in fic or Internet fandom in general, so just know that anything you write will be water in the desert to me.)

My main ship for this fandom is Hannibal x Scipio Africanus, in both the romantic and brotp sense (my other main ship is Hannibal x Happiness and Peace and Not Being Hounded to Death By Romans). I just can't get enough of how they seemed to genuinely like and respect each other, and how Scipio tried so hard to prevent his fellow Romans from ruining Hannibal after the war. If you choose to explore this relationship, I'd love to see what they thought of each other when they first met, and the slow development of mutual respect and admiration (and attraction, if you go that way) between them. Epistolary! Having to keep in touch post-Zama for boring political reasons and then finding that they genuinely do enjoy their correspondence! AU where they're on the same side/have to work together for some reason! AU where they fake their deaths and live happily ever after!

Hannibal's family was obviously hugely important to him, and I'd equally love to read something that explores his relationships with his father and brothers (and mysterious unnamed sisters). Did he really swear his infamous childhood blood oath? There's a story that his father died sacrificing himself to save Hannibal's life--how did that go down, and how does Hannibal feel about that? Also, kidfic! Tiny Hannibal playing with his even tinier brothers, and/or teaching them how to Be Badass and Fight Rome!

Actually, I'd be really interested in anything set before or after the war; there's just so little out there about Hannibal's childhood in Carthage/Spain, or his postwar exile as a footsore Odysseus wandering the Mediterranean, dodging Romans and flirting with Scipio and throwing snakes at enemy ships. Just. GIVE ME ALL THE HANNIBAL, I'LL EAT IT UP (WHILE WEEPING PROBABLY).

The Last of the Wine - Mary Renault 
Alkibiades (Last of the Wine)

Alkibiades ranks very near the top of my Favourite Historical Assholes list, and as a character in Last of the Wine he combines all the tropes I love to read about most in fiction: the brilliant, silvertongued charmer with all that dash, flamboyance, too few scruples, and maybe—just maybe—some genuine good intentions buried deep, deep down inside. I honestly never get sick of contemplating his various contradictions and complexities (or just straight up giggling at his various youthful escapades, because really).

Tbh, my main ship for this fandom is Alkibiades x the entire city of Athens. That line in Aristophanes (\"They pine for him, they hate him, dismiss him, and want him back\") is the most delicious sort of Pain ever and I'd love a fic that brings this out somehow (maybe via Alexias' somewhat fanboyish eyes?).

His relationships with Sokrates and Myron are also incredibly fascinating to me, and if you want to include either or both of those characters, I would love anything exploring their dynamics in more detail. What did Sokrates think of his trashfire hellion pupil, really? What did Myron see in him? Did Alkibiades ever feel guilt about not quite living up to their ideals, and did this influence his actions at all?

If you feel up to writing Alkibiades' own POV, what about an introspective character study or monologue set near the end of his life where he reflects on all he's done? What does he make of the entire mess in Sicily? Did he or did he not vandalise the hermai? Does he pine for Athens as much as it pines for him? He comes off as this dashing hurricane, this larger-than-life hero in the book, and I would love if you humanised him a little more.

Or, you know, something lulzy and light-hearted about any of his youthful exploits or scandals. (I am... endlessly amused about how there is an entire genre of Renaissance paintings of Sokrates dragging him out of various brothels.)

On a semi-unrelated note, Alkibiades' speech in the Symposium might be my favourite thing ever.

Howl Series - Diana Wynne Jones 
Howl Pendragon (Howl Series - DWJ)

Howl might be my favourite Drama Baby in all of fiction. I love his contradictions: how he can come off like a self-absorbed whiny pisspot at first, but when you get to know him better you find out he's also well-intentioned and caring and brave in a cowardly way and Trying To Save The Day despite being an all-round mess.

A pre-canon fic set in Wales would be amazing. What was Howl like in university? We know from DWJ that he majored in philosophy—why? Did he ever finish writing his dissertation on spells? When did he first know he was a wizard? How, exactly, did he find the door to Ingary? Was he telling the truth when he said he never met Suliman in Wales?

Howl's early years in Ingary are also really interesting to me. Like, it can't have been easy setting up a life in an entirely new world where he had no money and didn't know anyone. How did he get by? Why on earth did he catch Calcifer? Did he have to use Sophie's cayenne pepper trick a lot when he was first \"starting out in a small way\"? How did he meet Mrs. Pentstemmon? How many aunts brained him with their frying pans for seducing their niblings?

Or something that fills in the gaps in HMC. Sophie is a really unreliable narrator at the best of times, which is one of the most intriguing and frustrating things about the book, because there's so much we just don't know. What was Howl doing behind the scenes to try and save Suliman and Justin? Where did he really go when he was supposedly out courting? What were his first impressions of Sophie (besides DEATH BY CLEANING, SAVE US ALL)? When did he fall in love with her?

(My main Howl ship is Howl x Wizard Suliman, and I would literally liquefy if you included some juicy interactions with Ben, but you don't have to.)

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

Some possible prompts (slash, gen, and 'queer gen' all welcome):

- Right on the heels of the Dunkirk evacuation comes the Battle of Britain. What is that like for Collins? How does he cope with the strain of flying so often, with so little sleep and so many losses and such high stakes, so soon after he's lost Farrier and Fortis Leader? What are his relationships with the rest of the pilots in his squadron? How does the Collins of late 1940 differ from the Collins of, say, late 1939?

- Farrier's experience as a prisoner of war. Where does he end up, and what does he do there? (Perhaps he's eventually sent to Colditz?) Is he one of the very few who escapes and makes it back to England, or does he remain imprisoned until the end of the war in Europe? What does he do afterwards -- does he try to rejoin a fighter squadron, or has he had enough of flying? What would it be like for him to meet Collins after his repatriation?

- Collins as one of Archibald McIndoe's Guinea Pigs, like Richard Hillary or Geoffrey Page. How would Collins contend with being disabled and/or disfigured; with spending the rest of his war undergoing a difficult series of operations and convalescences; with not being able to fly again? How would he navigate a post-VE reunion with Farrier under those circumstances? 

General DNWs: Homophobia as a central focus of the fic. AUs that take the characters out of the canon setting or significantly change the characters (e.g. genderswap, ageswap, etc).

Canon-specific DNWs: Collins and Farrier written as explicitly heterosexual or as in sexual/romantic relationships with women.

Edward Edward - Lolah Burford 
James Noel Holland, Edward Clare

Some possible prompts:

- The first time I read Edward, Edward, the ending threw me for a loop: after all that, after being subjected to Noel's moods and desires for so long that he's learned to mold himself in opposition or in submission to them, Edward walks away? I have the sense that that wasn't really the end for either of them. So: what if they resumed their relationship, in some form or another? Would it be Noel who sought out Edward, or vice versa? How would they and their dynamic have changed in the interval? 

- One of the episodes that has haunted me most is Noel's seduction of Marion Alleyn after having shown him Edward in the priest hole. What was that like from Noel's perspective? Perhaps he was attempting to satiate himself by having someone close to Edward without actually having Edward? Perhaps he did it simply out of a desire to ruin Edward's friendship as thoroughly as possible? Did he enjoy Edward's response, or did it leave him curiously unsatisfied?

- Despite (or perhaps because of) what he suffers, Edward maintains an extraordinary sense of morality. What if he didn't? If, as the years passed, Noel realized that Edward was becoming more and more like him? Would there come a moment when Edward and Noel found their roles reversed, with Edward as the one who sets the terms of their relationship, who makes Noel his subject? How would Noel react to having his power over Edward wrested away and turned back on him?

General DNWs: Homophobia as a central focus of the fic. AUs that take the characters out of the canon setting or significantly change the characters (e.g. genderswap, ageswap, etc).

Canon-specific DNWs: Sexual activity between Noel and Edward that takes place earlier than it did in canon.

Does he ever meet W.H.R. Rivers outside of Craiglockhart? Perhaps he becomes closer to Robert Graves? How does he remember Sassoon and their relationship? What was their last meeting like, what were the last letters they wrote to each other? 

- Both Sassoon and Owen survive the war. How does their relationship evolve? Do they go off into the countryside and become pig farmers together? Or does Owen become one puzzle-piece of Sassoon's complex and unfortunate love life (would he have to compete with Stephen Tennant)? How do their literary careers compare?

- Sassoon and Owen carry out a secret relationship at Craiglockhart. Who is the one to initiate it? What is the dynamic like between the repressed Sassoon and the slightly more experienced, franker Owen? How does one go about a relationship in 'Dottyville'? Is it really all that secret (there's Rivers to get past, for one)? Do they make any plans for 'after the war ends', or is the relationship predicated on the likelihood of one or both of them being killed?

I’d love a Smiley-focused story. He is my kind of hero-- reserved, clever, elegant, sensitive, perceptive. Someone who doesn’t always attract a lot of attention, but quietly observes until he knows when to strike. I really enjoyed Gary Oldman’s portrayal of him in this movie. His reservation and inscrutability makes those moments when he is vulnerable--catching Ann with Haydon at the Christmas party, or trying to negotiate with Karla--al the more powerful. Some ideas:

•	A Smiley/Control pairing, or more background on their personal or professional relationship
•	Another long, revelatory afternoon with Connie Sachs, discussing their memories and doubts about the Circus.
•	More examples of Smiley being a crafty spy or mentoring prodigal spies similar to Ricky Tarr
•	Cat and mouse games between Smiley and objects of his espionage or his political rivals

Go deep into the sense of suspicion and unease, the sexual repression, the dread. Run with whatever strikes you, but here are some ideas anyhow:

•	What did Flora or Miles experience when they were alone with the ghosts of Miss Jessel or Quint?
•	What is Mrs. Grose’s inner life like as she tries to repress Miss Jessel and Quint’s deaths and the weird happenings that follow? What did she see of Quint and Miss Jessel’s troublesome behavior?
•	What goes through Miss Giddens mind as she tries to process Miles’ flirtatious overtures?
•	Miles might ultimately be “free” of Quint, but is Flora ever really free of Ms. Jessel? 

I acknowledge that in the movie, sexual desires and energies are channeled through the children. That said, I’d prefer not to see them in explicit sexual situations (though I’m okay with such situations for the adult characters). If you’re going to explore these themes with the children, please keep things at the level of the film: kisses and creepy conversation.

There's nothing I don't love about this movie, but Dee, Yuchi and their rivalry turned friendship - that's my very favourite part. Anything that showcases this aspect of the movie would make me happy. Maybe a casefic, or a vignette set early on, when they are still figuring each other out? Or, idk, they have a chat about their pasts, or attend an awkward party, or have to scramble to avoid the Empress' displeasure. If you want to make it romantic, I'm so there for it, but friendship fic would be great, too.

14th Century CE RPF 
Henry IV of England (14th Century CE RPF), Vytautas of Lithuania (14th Century CE RPF)

So, Vytautas and Henry did actually meet in real life during Henry's visit to Prussia in 1390. I find it pretty interesting, because one could find several parallels between their lives - both were first cousins and childhood friends to their respective monarchs, both were eventually driven to rebellion (in fact, Vytautas was already on his second attempt in 1390), and both wound up ruling their countries in the end. Yet there were also plenty of differences, and that fascinates me. How well would they have understood one another, if at all? What would they agree or disagree on? Henry thought his sojourn to Prussia was a crusade - I can't imagine Vytautas not taking a cynical view of that, especially since Lithuania had already accepted Christianity in 1386. I love clashing/multiple viewpoints, conflicting values and cultures, grey areas and moral dilemmas. Basically anything about this meeting would delight me!

Worldweavers - Alma Alexander 

I'd love something about the education system, from a child starting their first Ars Magica classes to the creation of the Wandless Academy.  I'm a math teacher, and the mention of mathemagic, spell-solving of equations, and fractionators had me wishing I could see more of those.  Or write something about magic run amok, like feral libraries, or magic as used in crimes and criminal justice, etc.  Or explore some of the other types of magic (the ones mentioned in the list of all the things they tried in order to find Thea's magic).  Or maybe something with society setup, like the Federal Bureau of Magic, or how it's integrated into the everyday lives of people (note the bit in the first book about people not using cars much due to portals, slipways, transfigurations . . .), even as regards to having magic allergies (the medical profession would be interesting!)  Use whatever you know well.  I'm not into sports (the only possible exception is Olympic gymnastics or ice skating which I watched back in the '90s, mainly) or fashion, but I'll find just about any other industry fascinating; I like complex systems and how they work (hence my fascination with air traffic control and airports in general).  The world of Worldweavers feels familiar but there are so many interesting changes!

If you find yourself inspired by Thea, I'd love something set after Dawn of Magic, where she settles into her full power, finishes at Amford, etc.  Does she create anything really special in her life?  Like the Elemental houses, for instance.  Something that no one else could do.

I'd love anything from their friendship during the rest of the summer after the events in the film, or at school the following year; they're local celebrities now, but they're not going to let that get to their heads.  What's popularity compared to a friendship you can count on?  I'm good with turning it into a romantic friendship, too.  I just love the bond these two have!  I can see them talking about their dads, about what they'll do when they're grown up, going on more adventures at Bear Mountain…  Feel free to AU things too, if you like the idea of them running away for whatever reason, or if Jody had actually killed Ray, or if Ray did worse things besides beat up Lynette.  (I'm quite OK with some dark themes here as long as the girls end up together and have each other.)  Or what if Beth didn't crash the boat and Jody was living in Bear Mountain by herself?  (whether Ray lived or not)  So many ways to focus on these two girls, and I would have so much love for whatever you write. :D

Demonata Series - Darren Shan 
Bec (Demonata), Grubbs Grady, Kernel Fleck, Lord Loss

As a starting note: I know I requested all four characters here, and while I’d be thrilled with a fic that has the four of them together I’d be equally thrilled to see a fic that focuses on any of them.

The Demonata is one of my favourite book series ever, and probably where my penchant for getting into tiny book fandoms started. It's a really dark story at several parts, whenever the Demonata pop up to be specific, but also contains really compelling characters and plots that keep me interested even when the grimness would otherwise drive me away. It's definitely a horror, but also contains some really interesting fantasy elements and a fascinating approach to magic. It also seems to have a really cast iron tone/moral of hope even on the darkest day, which has always appealed to me. Anything that appreciates the darkness of the setting, while also focusing on hope spots, would be great!

And, uh, this may be a slightly disjointed paragraph as I talk about why I love all the characters here! First of all I love all of the characters in the Kah-Gash, I adore Bec’s smartness and Kernel’s diplomacy against all odds and the way Grubbs just keeps diving over that moral line. I also love Lord Loss, how he is so much the chessmaster and just revels in it. I love how all of the Kah Gash interact with each other, how they truly come to rely on each other but still have numerous conflicting opinions at the end of the series. And I especially love how Lord Loss interacts with all the members of the Kah Gash, how they start off as enemies but end up – at least in the case of Kernel and Bec – definite allies and something close to friends.

I just love everything about these books. They're high drama romance novels involving vampires, which should be something that attracts severe side eye, but they're just really enjoyable! Great worldbuilding, absolutely fantastic characters and so much room for porny interpretations. I'd definitely recommend them to anybody who likes vampires and villains.

I really love the interplay between these two, especially in the bits where Claudius is being kept prisoner. I love the darkness within Dawn, and the way that Claudius mirrors that. I love how they both have such complex lives, and quite obviously find a mirror of those lives in each other. Anything exploring the darkness between them and how they react to finding that in each other would be wonderful!

La Peste | The Plague - Albert Camus 
Bernard Rieux, Jean Tarrou

I first read this book only this year, and LOVED it. It's definitely my favourite bit of fiction about a plague! I love the writing style, how beautifully it conveys the quiet desolation of the Plague. I love the choices it presents, and how it examines and treats thosd choices. And I especially love how dark it gets, and yet how it still manages to maintain this essential sense of battle optimism.

My favourite two characters in it are probably these two. Neither of them present themselves as heroes, both actively shirk the term, but both really are. They're both very brave, both very smart and I love how they seem to find some sort of companionship in each other. I'd love to see more of their relationship, from canon style interactions to something more.

Blake & Avery Series - M. J. Carter

This is absolutely one of my favourite series, and if you’ve read it I’m sure you know why. Interesting plots, wonderful diversity, Historical accuracy AND a relationship between the two main characters so endearing that I had to keep putting my copy of the book down to clutch my face with glee. Truly, a dangerous combination.

As you can probably guess, what I want most in this fandom is fic exploring the relationship between Blake and Avery even further. I loved their dynamic in the book, and I really want to see more of it. Especially in a romantic sense. I feel that there’s a hell of a lot of potential for a really interesting romantic relationship there, and I’d absolutely love to see somebody explore that!

One thing I will say, though, is that adultery is one of my major squicks and so I’d prefer it if you worked around Helen. She can either be friends with Avery or just not appearing, but I’d prefer it if they weren’t actually married if you choose to write a romantic dynamic.

Hap and Leonard (TV) 
Hap Collins (Hap and Leonard (TV)), Leonard Pine (Hap and Leonard (TV))

I love Hap and Leonard’s matter-of-fact bond, where they’re totally paired up no matter who else is in their lives or beds. And they know each other so very well. But I also love how not all their cards are on the table—when they get especially protective (which they so often do), they might try to keep that on the down low (e.g. Hap privately warning Chester, or Leonard privately warning Trudy). I love the flaws that come inextricably with their strengths, and how they may fall down three times but help each other back up four.

I’d love some Hap/Leonard slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it), where they do allow that intimate dimension into their existing marriage. Is it difficult for Leonard to permit that last bit of vulnerability with someone who already knows him as well as Hap? (As opposed to for instance Raoul, who knows him sexually but is kept at more of an emotional distance?) What is it like for Hap, to be allowed in to that last private ground? Or to have that level of connection actually reciprocated, instead of his tradition of longing after the unattainable?

If you don’t want that intimate aspect involved, fair enough—optional details are optional!--but I’d ask that it be at least as intense a bond as in canon, which would make it the warmest of warm gen and the romanciest of bromances.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help: some kind of a small case or mini mystery, if you feel case-storyish? They get stuck together somewhere—in the woods? On a boat? On a vacation that gets complicated? They’re working together on some kind of task, like rebuilding an old house or school or church? Do any of their previous experiences together (as kids or when grown) come back to haunt them?

Jack Aubrey (M&C 2003), Stephen Maturin (M&C 2003)

Jack and Stephen are the movie's core and throughline, the most important emotional duet. They're so comfortable together, so content with each other and their life, and yet there are still important questions they end up facing--for instance, about what each would sacrifice for the other. It feels like no matter how bonded they are and how well they know each other, there's always something more for them to discover, to overcome, and to willingly give.

I'd love some Jack/Stephen slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) that finds one of these new discoveries, that extends their bond even further than they thought they were allowed to go.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Another adventure or battle? Or the reverse, a very quiet time, an intermission of peace and comfort in between their dangerous missions? Stephen having to go a-spying, and how Jack might react or help? Some time spent ashore, especially far from home? They get captured?

Rejseholdet | Unit One 
Allan Fischer, Thomas La Cour

I love these guys AND I want to knock their heads together. They are so full of \"NOW. KISS.\" moments, where they're buzzing with desperate energy, staring at each other, seeming to long for SOMETHING--but trapped in themselves and unable to take that step.

Even though there are no partners in Rejseholdet, Fischer and La Cour seem to have forcibly partnered themselves up. And even after the longest workday, they'll be asking each other out for dinner or drinks. Not to mention that we know they holiday together! It's like they can't keep away and they can't stop trying to get closer, even when it's awkward or full of meaningful silences. And when the unit itself is disbanded, their antidote is to grab each other and lunge into a total Me And Him Against The World situation.

I'd love some Fischer/La Cour slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) where they get to feed this undeniable hunger for each other at last and feel thoroughly connected.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

A missing scene from an episode, or an episode aftermath? Something about La Cour's powers and Fischer's supportive belief in him? (What if his powers go wrong somehow? Or if they become instrumental in saving his and/or Fischer’s life? And/or Fischer ends up believing in them more than La Cour does?) A rescue, either physical or emotional? Another case, or the aftermath of one that went well or very badly indeed? Another vacation together? Another undercover mission, this time with La Cour undercover, or even both of them? Post-series reunion?

I like the rest of the team (especially Ingrid and IP, and Boysen too), so feel free to include them if you want.

Shetland (TV) 
Jimmy Perez, Duncan Hunter

Jimmy is protective, calm, steadfast, gentle but driven—he’s such a shepherd to his flock, or if not the shepherd then certainly the sheepdog. He seems like such an idealist, even after all the things he’s seen in his job. Contrariwise, Duncan is more of a cynic, more about the grin and the quick deal, looking out for number one--though when it comes to Jimmy, he is a loving and supportive friend, and that supposed selfishness goes out the window. Circumstances brought them together to parent Cassie, in the least-stereotypical, least-macho ways imaginable, and that relationship seems to have left them open and vulnerable to each other, with deep potential reservoirs of trust and tenderness despite the strains and conflicts of daily life.

I'd love some Jimmy/Duncan slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) that lets them reveal this tenderness more openly to each other, where the closeness they have found is allowed to exist and expand even without the parenting aspect.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Jimmy’s empty-nest syndrome? Cassie’s growing up and moving on, and he could really use some help coping. Jimmy needing Duncan’s help with a case? What about Duncan, the slippery businessman, having to face his own possible fears of openness and idealism? (Don’t they say there’s no cynic like a disappointed idealist?) Hurt/comfort, with Jimmy hurt in some way while digging up clues and Duncan needing to come to his rescue? Or vice-versa?

The competence, the risk-taking, the newly-developing knowledge of and need for each other—I'd love to see that go further.

I'd love some Henry/Johnny slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) where they get to extend their new connection beyond the grift, finding new challenges and comforts in each other.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Henry and Johnny stuck without the con framework to rely on--how might they get to know each other, without work to give them the excuse? Or what if they had to blend in on a totally different social level, either the highest class, or the lowest? 

Another con, big or small, or they play parts to help out someone else's con? Maybe even a con that goes wrong or fails entirely? But totally don't feel like you have to whip up a con if you’d rather not. I'm sure a lot of their life together happens between jobs, whether it's prepping for something, escaping from danger (from the law or the underworld), Johnny learning a new skill, or Henry learning a little something himself.

If it becomes relevant, I ask that the good guys’ cons be against \"deserving\" targets—fitting the Robin Hoodish tone of the movie, where you go after the well-heeled and greedy, using their own greed to trap them.

I love the rest of the grifters (especially Kid Twist), so feel free to include any of them if you want.

Happy or at least hopeful ending please!

The Goblin Emperor - Katherine Addison 
Csethiro Ceredin, Csevet Aisava, Maia Drazhar

I would adore anything with any combination of these characters - if you want to write just two of them, please feel free! Or something just about Csethiro on her own because she is awesome and I want to know so much more about her. Her childhood, how she learned to fight, her relationships with the other women about the court. I am happy with shipping any of them or all three of them, or friend-shipping them. 

General prompts to be ignored at will: I love Maia's constant deliberate effort to be a good person, and a good ruler; with Csevet's determined control of everything he can manage to manage for Maia, for Csethiro's honesty and her will to fight people (especially when she wishes she could for Maia!) - though as she never gets a chance to in the book, I would love to see her actually get the chance to use her sword! I would love any story about how she and Csevet get along, particularly after the wedding - they will both be a large part of Maia's life, do they end up working together to manage Maia's diary - or Maia himself, to make sure he takes care of himself? I would love the fluff-fic equivalent of Maia just being wrapped up in a fluffy blanket and looked after for a day (and having a chance to meditate!), or Csevet being forced to take the day off (he's working as hard as Maia, but at least he doesn't have to be emperor!) and Csethiro trying to work out how she can help rule would be glorious. 

General likes: I happily read gen/het/slash/femmeslash/poly. Things I adore more than others include worldbuilding, partnerships - especially the development of them - fealty/loyalty, things which feel epic - not in length so much as the sense that there is a whole world about this story which you can glimpse in the offhand details, stories and mythologies within the world of the fiction, characters - especially women - getting to fight and to be awesome and strong in a variety of ways, swords, gender-confusion and gender-play, sensory depictions of the way magic feels, murder mysteries, AUs, and the kinds of crossovers and fusions which really shouldn't work and yet make far too much sense. I also like to see competent people doing things well, and enjoying themselves.

Do not wants: dubcon/noncon, main character death, public humiliation/embarrassment, age play/infantalism, scat, watersports. If anyone is having sex I would like them to be both mentally and physically grown-up.

Uprooted - Naomi Novik 
Agnieszka (Uprooted), The Dragon | Sarkan, Kasia (Uprooted)

As with 'the goblin emperor' I would adore anything with any combination of these characters - if you want to write just two of them, please feel free! I ship any combination, and friend-ship all combinations. 

General prompts to be ignored at will: I love Kasia and Agnieszka's connection and their history and I'd love to see more of it - maybe Kasia trying to teach Agnieszka some of the skills she was being taught and it going terribly, brilliantly wrong? Agnieszka trying to help Kasia adjust to her new strength and abilities? I adore Agnieszka's stubborn-headed determination and the way she feels her way through her magic, her utter confusion at the complications of the court. In contrast, I love Kasia's calmness and her steadfastness, I'd love something with her and Sarkan getting to know each other better, either during or after canon, maybe bonding over wondering how Agnieszka can be such an impossible nonsense with her mess and her magic and her ability to just find a way to /get things done/ somehow. I love Sarkan's confusion over Agnieska's magic making no sense and his growing unwitting trust in her to somehow do something about any problem, whether he wants to trust in her or not. I also love his care for details and beauty, and how he must love beautiful magic done well - and how that clashes with the utter mess Agnieszka's magic seems and the mess she makes of all his plans and expectations. I'd love it if he could share some of that love of neatness and beautiful things with Kasia, while Agnieszka is mildly and affectionately confused by both of them and can't keep tidy if you pay her (no matter how you pay her).

Magic Knight Rayearth 

I love all the nominated characters! I also love every other character in the whole series. If there is a Rayearth character you want to write about which wasn't one of the four picked, please feel free to branch out! Especially as I nominated a strange handful of characters this year - Zazu, Tarta, and Caldina are characters I would love to have more fic about and Clef's my favourite so I'm always happy with anything with him, but I honestly just want MORE for this fandom. (It's the one I come back to again and again and again and I've had some lovely fic for it from Yuletide before and I would love a little more from the bottom of my heart.) 

I'm happy with whatever variation of canon you want to work with, including a mix, I'm familiar with and very fond of all of them.

My only specific caveat for Rayearth is that I'm not into shipping Presea/Clef or Ascot/Umi (though if you're willing to add Clef in and make it Ascot/Umi/Clef I am perfectly happy!)

Ships I do happily sail off with include - Umi/Clef, Zazu/Ascot, Caldina/LaFarga, Umi/Tarta, Caldina/Tatra, Presea/Hikaru, the knights together in any combination, and practically anything else. 

Some prompt-type things to be ignored at will: I love the tensions between the different characters with their various loyalties in canon - to each other, to their worlds, to what they think they should do. I love the world with its mix of fantasy and scifi tropes. Clef is my favourite character in anything, because of his loyalty, and the dilemma it puts him in and how he battles with the line between loyalty to the people he loves and the land. I'd like him to have a chance to be happy and also actually get some sleep after the events of canon! I'd also love anything about his backstory, how he came to be Guru, learning magic etc. 

I think Zazu is glorious in his enthusiasm for everything but especially giant robots - does he ever get to pilot one? What is it like being a ship's engineer so young - I'd love interactions between him and the rest of the ship's crew. I'd also love to see anything with him getting to know Cephiro and what he makes of the magic. 

Caldina's interesting morality and her honesty about her goals are wonderful. I'd love to know more about her life before Cephiro, or how she and LaFarga became a thing, or what she does once Cephiro is settled - does she get a job? Teach Cephirans to dance? Learn Cephiran magic? 

Tarta's bluntness and her temper probably manage to get her into all kinds of awkward situations, with or without her sister there to pull her out again - I'd love to see something about her when she was younger, or something where she's trying to learn to deal with politics and finds her own way of negotiating them. (Or shippy fic with her and Umi!)

Genfic or implied Hank/Sheila. Nothing much more explicit than the cartoon ever got (so, the two of them admitting that they have feelings for each other and wondering where they go from here is fine. One of the two being hurt or captured and the other facing up to having feelings is great. No PWP). If you're giving me gen, I don't like unhappy endings but angst ending on a hopeful note or the ever-popular \"Oh no! We missed our chance to get home again! It's okay... there'll be other chances\" is fine. You can give me time in the Realm, time before the Realm, time after the Realm.

you can take this in any direction you like, and expand upon this as much or as little as you like; are there interactions and thoughts before this that lead up to any sort of culmination?

Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte | Please Save My Earth 
Ogura Jinpachi | Gyokuran, Nishikiyori Issei | Enju

I like reincarnation stories and this one is epic. Anime or manga, I'm not fussy. I would prefer slash between Jinpachi and Issei or gen. Canon het can be included, though I would like Jinpachi and Issei to end up together. It can be future-fic or past timeline fic or current timeline (before the manga epilogue) with Jinpachi and Issei as teenagers. Explore their relationship and how their memories of their past lives affect them today. Or maybe a fic on how they've gotten over the past and living their current lives to the fullest. I would prefer a happy ending but an ambiguous ending is fine as well for this fandom. I would like to avoid a sad or tragic story though as their past lives canon is sad enough.

Kawachi Daikichi, Kaga Rin

I have few exceptions where I actually like het and this is one of them. I also love the canon het pairing which isn't the popular choice amongst those who read this series. I would love to read het or gen for this fandom. 

Gen fic when Rin was younger would be great. Explore some of the other holidays or just how Daikichi and Rin interact with the others. Maybe something with Rin's friends. 

Het fic when Rin is older would also be lovely. Maybe something set between the time Rin confesses and Daikichi returns her feelings. How does Daikichi's family handle the news that he's marrying Rin? Or something from Daikichi's POV, how does he fall in love with Rin? Or something post-canon. Maybe Rin and Daikichi as parents.

On the gen side, you can explore Megumi's relationship with her friends, especially her best friend. Or what about some other adventures and/or other fights? Or maybe something set post-canon with Genzo and Megumi ending up together. If slash is more your thing though, what if Megumi was really born a boy and turns back into a boy?

刀剣乱舞 | Touken Ranbu 
Mutsunokami Yoshiyuki (刀剣乱舞 | Touken Ranbu)

Gen would mostly be preferable since I don't really romantically ship Mutsu with any of the other swords, but I do have a soft spot for Mutsu/Male Saniwa or everybody having a sorta unrequited crush for Mutsu (because he deserves all the love) if you're more slash-inclined.

For prompts, I would honestly just be happy with Mutsu interacting with any swords tbh, be it angsty or fluffy or both, since he's one of the few swords that's not really in any group like the Awataguchi swords or the Shinsengumi swords and the like.

An exploration of his love for technology and generally 'new' things would also be very welcome.

Optional detail that I would appreciate but isn't required would be Mutsu being the starter sword of the saniwa, since he was my starter too lol.

But yyeesss. Give me more Mutsu/Ryouma interaction. Maybe the saniwa keeps sending the 2nd unit to Ryouma-centric events and while Mutsu tries and tries to distance himself away, him and Ryouma just keep meeting lol. Ryouma then ending up recognizing Mutsu every time he saves him.

Or maybe canon-divergence where Mutsu and Ryouma did <s>elope</s> run away into the sunset and cruise around the world. Tbh I can't ever see Mutsu doing it, but if you think you can make it convincing, go for it!

I'd love it more if it were set in it's original timeline, the one where they're in 7th grade in 1986-1987. I don't care which one it is of the original babysitters. But in honor of Ann m. Martin finally coming out a few years ago, let's let one of her characters have a coming out story.

Orphan Island - Laurel Snyder 
Jinny (Orphan Island), Deen (Orphan Island)

I desperately need to know what the outside world is like. I would enjoy an explanation of the island if that compels you, but just seeing Jinny out in the world would fascinate me. Is it our world? Where in our world does she end up? Does she find Deen?

Weetzie Bat Series - Francesca Lia Block 
Weetzie Bat, My Secret Agent Lover Man

Princess Bride (1987) 
Inigo Montoya, Fezzik (Princess Bride)

While I'm not the biggest fluff lover, I am totally fine if this one leans a little fluffy. Sometimes the amount Inigo and Fezzik care about one another makes me want to cry. It is to the movie's credit that it gave us what I feel are two beautiful romances. I would love to see this one become explicitly a romance. A post-canon thing would be great, since the ending mostly focuses on Westley and Buttercup and I want to know what Inigo and Fezzik's story holds. Pre-canon, their stories before Buttercup encounters them in the woods, could also be fun. We get a bit of their backstories, but there is probably room to play. The two of them having any sort of adventure together in the spirit of the story would also be a delight I have read the book, so if you have, feel free to incorporate aspects or details from that. If you haven't or do not feel like it, also totally fine. Smut is welcome if that is a direction you'd like to go!

Rocky Horror Picture Show 
Columbia (RHPS), Magenta (RHPS)

I think the moment that most captures my interest in Columbia and Magenta is during \"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\" when they are lounging in Columbia's room and Columbia is painting Magenta's toenails for her and they are watching Janet with Rocky and egging Janet on. I want to know more about their relationship! I know Columbia had Eddie and Magenta had Riff-Raff, but with how debauched their lives seem to be, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little more to their relationship. I would be happy to see any backstory or exploration of their relationship, including conflict between them (Magenta wants to return to Transylvania, Columbia seems dissatisfied after Eddie is gone; they seem to have very different desires and I can see them clashing). If you want to go a smutty direction, I can imagine the two of them getting worked up over seeing Janet and Rocky together and going at it together. First times are always fun to, either the first time they met when Columbia joined Frank, or their first time hooking up.

We Know the Devil (Visual Novel) 
Jupiter (We Know the Devil), Neptune (We Know the Devil), Venus (We Know the Devil)

I would love to see a post-canon for these three. The ending (all of them, but especially the True Ending) is so beautiful and open that I would be into seeing what comes next: what is this new world like and what do these girls, in their new angelic/monstrous bodies, do in it? A scene taking place in the course of the game that you wished had happened, or a pre-canon story of the week at camp leading up to their night in the woods would also be rad. Feel free to get weird, if you want to do something in the grand and poetic and emotional style of the game, or do something with a bunch monstrous girls in a world ruled by the Devil or what it means to all be in love in that situation.

Black Widow (Comics) 
Natasha Romanov (Black Widow Comics)

In Nathan Edmondson's recent run on Black Widow, Natasha grudgingly adopted a black cat named Liho (an old-fashioned Russian word for \"evil\" or \"bad luck\" or \"the devil\"). I'd like to see a story exploring that side of her character--the reluctantly vulnerable side of her that takes care of small vulnerable creatures while still being tough as nails in her own way. If you're not familiar with that particular run, it doesn't have to be about Liho in particular, of course! But I do love cats.

I'm a Bucky/Natasha fan, but I have no problems with the story just being about Natasha, or about her relationships with other characters.

Final Fantasy IV 
Rydia (Final Fantasy IV), Edward \"Edge\" Geraldine

Final Fantasy IV is a pretty bare-bones game as plot and characterization goes, considering its era--but I've always been curious how the relationship between spoiled prince Edge and mysterious troubled summoner Rydia would have developed if it had been expanded beyond jokes and hints.

I don't necessarily want to see them hook up and have babies ever after, but I'd like to see some exploration of the brief dynamic between them in canon where he flirts and she brushes him off awkwardly but shows some kind of interest at the end.

I still haven't played the After Years, so I'd prefer not to get too deep into that.

Gairad (The Course of Honour)

I would be happy to read just about anything in this fandom, honestly--I like the worldbuilding, I love the main characters, and I love the decent heart of the story. But I especially thought it would be fun to learn more about Gairad since she's from a different part of the universe, with a different perspective from any of the main characters. Backstory, or her perspective on canon events, or post-canon stories, would all be fun; I'm interested in her relationship with Jainan but would also be happy to read about her with other people or alone.

I'm submitting almost exactly the same request as I did last year, except this year I also got the protagonist nominated to increase the chances that someone would take a crack at this fandom. Mostly I just love this book a lot and want to spend some more time with this universe. I'm not expecting anybody to write in as much cosmology as Stephenson does (not by a long shot!) but if you'd like to write about the people who are thinking about it, and the way the life of the mind is conducted in this world, I'd enjoy that very much.

Dykes to Watch Out For 
Giant Lesbian Potato Genetically Engineered By Monsanto

For additional likes please see my letter. 

I do not want stories containing: dub-con, non-con, mpreg, A/B/O, incest, underage, homophobia, transphobia, self-harm or suicide.

I don't want fic based on specific past or current real-world environmental disasters, nor their impacts on living people. AUs, Green Aesops and analogies, cosmic or otherwise, are fine, as are more general themes about anthropogenic environmental degradation.

I’d rather not receive PWP, RPF, or holiday-themed stories.

I'd prefer Monsanto were not portrayed in a positive light. 

***

Ah, Dykes to Watch Out For, the slice-of-life-always-politically-relevant-lesbian-soap-opera of our hearts. I'll be honest with you, barring one day getting the television adaptation we deserve, I'm pretty happy with how canon (semi-)ended. I think we left most of the characters in pretty good places. No, I'm here for something over-the-top, cracky, and absurd, based on a one-page (p. 225 of 'The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For', in fact) dig at Monsanto. What I would love, truly, is for you to run completely wild with this, take the fact that this is Mo's dream out of the equation, join hands and imagine with me that publicly traded American multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation (thanks Wikpedia for that sentence), Monsanto, did, in fact, genetically engineer a giant lesbian potato. And, Yulegoat, I have but one question for you:

Who is she?

The potato in question can be the one in Mo's dream or, really, any generic Giant Lesbian Potato Genetically Engineered by Monsanto. 

Dystopias, utopias, neither-better-nor-worse-alternate-universe-opias, it's all good here. If you work a joke about 'eating your vegetables' in there I can guarantee at least one person (me) will laugh.

If you're going to include other DTWOF characters, my favorites are Lois, Clarice, Ginger, Sparrow, Sydney, Thea and Janis.

***

This whole film is basically a big love letter to A) math (!) and science (!), and B) humans helping other humans out, which I love. I also loved Rich Purnell. He's kind of a mess! He's a steely-eyed missile man! This is the kind of film where most of the cast gets to be a hero, but I was especially pleased when Rich played his part in saving the day. His scenes were funny without feeling like you're laughing at him; his initial mishaps are relatable, and you really want to know if he solves that problem! If you're going to include other characters, I'd be most interested in seeing Bruce Ng, Mark Watney, Vincent Kapoor, or Mindy Park. If you're writing shipfic I'd prefer Rich/Bruce or Rich/Mark. I'm pretty much down for whatever wacky science fiction premise you want to toss in the ring here, so long as there's a healthy dose of saving the day with mathematics. 

Prompts:

When we meet Rich, he's behind on his work, trips, then spits coffee through a bin. His supervisor, presumably, seems used to this. Prior to the Ares III mission, what's Rich's life like? How did he come to work at NASA? 

The scene at the end, where he and Bruce exchange a look across the room, watching the next mission launch, seems unusual, like Rich doesn't often participate in things like that. Does he now? Are he and Bruce friends? 

Does he get a lot of attention now? How does he deal with it? Does he meet Mark Watney? 

If it were Rich, not Mark, stuck on Mars, how would he react? How would he get back to Earth? What would he say, upon being told the whole world was reading his written responses?

I've requested any and I mean it: go wild, whoever you want to write about is fine by me. Unless it’s Saul/Charlie you’re writing, I’d prefer f/f if it’s shipfic and I'm pretty much down for whoever you want to include there. I'd really enjoy Ghost Bird/The Biologist, Grace/The Psychologist, Grace/her wife, and Anyone/Area X itself, but don't feel limited by that.

Prompts: 

Ghost Bird and Grace, post-canon, back on the other side. What if everything is different? Has it changed for the better, or worse?

More of the Biologist's field work before her recruitment. Perhaps the Psychologist tags along as part of the screening process. If it's a coastal place, how does the Psychologist feel about it? 

What happened to Whitby? I'd love something that tracked his progress from a fresh-faced recruit to the science division pre-canon to his eventual fate in Area X.

What was Saul's life like before moving to the lighthouse? Did he have other brushes with the strange and unexplained? Is there any possibility of freedom?

I’d love more interaction between the Psychologist and Whitby, or the Psychologist and Grace, pre-canon.

The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society - Mary Ann Shaffer & Annie Barrows 
Sidney Stark, Juliet Ashton (Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society)

I would love to read just about anything chronicling the lifelong friendship of these two, be it pre-novel, post-novel, or heck, both! How did Juliet's girlhood friendship with Sophie evolve to include Sophie's much older brother? Around when and how did Juliet and Sidney properly become friends in their own right? What did Sidney think of his little sister's friend Juliet initially, and how did his feelings about her change? What about that incident when she apparently broke his leg, and he was \"a vile patient\"? Did they ever, a bit wine-buzzed perhaps, debate the pros and cons of her becoming his beard? How did he encourage her as a writer? How has their relationship changed now that he's her long-suffering (but happily so) friend/editor?

If you want to include other characters, how have Sidney and Juliet interacted over the years with each other's other friends, acquaintances, and romantic partners? Juliet's letter concerning Sidney's disappearance to tend to Piers could be read as implying a past relationship between the two. If so, what was that like? Did Juliet tease Sidney incessantly over his having found a man? Was she secretly rooting for them, and sad when it ended? (How did it end...or did it even really end?) Did Juliet ever have her own bond with Piers as a fellow writer, independent of his relationship with Sidney? As for Sidney's feelings about Juliet's boyfriends...we know he (rightly) disliked Mark, and seems (again, rightly) approving of Dawsey. Does he cultivate his own friendship with Dawsey (or vice versa) now that the latter is engaged to Juliet? Does he give a speech for Juliet at her wedding? Does he spend her reception trying to duck Isola's hare-brained but well-intentioned attempts to hook him up with Booker, because they are both homosexual? Is Juliet, now happily settled with Dawsey and Kit, not-so-subtly trying to convince Sidney to move to Guernsey one day as well? Has she enlisted Isola to help her out with this? Tell me anything and everything!

The Avengers (TV) 
John Steed (The Avengers (TV)), Emma Peel (The Avengers (TV))

First off...I ship it. I will always ship it. I'm not much of an OTP kind of person, but Steed and Emma are about as close as I get. They are the pairing of my heart and soul. However, that being said...I do not, and will never, ship it in a \"conventional romance\" kind of way. No wedding bells and baby carriages for these two; they're going to be having unbelievable adventures defending Britain from its campiest foes until they're old and grey. (In my headcanon, they don't even move in together until they *are* old and grey.) For this reason, I would far rather read gen with maybe a few canon-like innuendos thrown in than anything super-sappy, so if you don't ship it, no worries. You are 100% safe, and I will love anything you write.

As far as prompts are concerned: outlandish casefic is always great! Intimate private moments between cases are always great! Fix-it fic for \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" is always great! (It's just a blip on the radar, an unfortunate misunderstanding, a ship that's sailed, etc. The Tara series in general is but a footnote... though Tara herself is awesome and deserves to go on as the hero of her own story, so please don't take that as character-bashing!) Fic where Cathy turns up again and immediately bonds with Emma, and Steed has to contend with the two of them united, would be great! (Bonus points for exploring Steed's transformation from the much harder-edged character Cathy knew into the true gentleman who falls for Emma.) Fic about their still-action-packed twilight years would be great! (And if you like crossovers at all, maybe around 2008-ish said action-packed twilight years could cause them to cross paths with Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman.) Fic about their earlier lives, leading up to the moment they finally meet, would be great! Anything involving Emma kicking arse, and Steed truly finding this a joy to behold when he isn't busy also kicking arse, would be great!

I also to some degree ship both/either of them with Chidi and to some degree none of them with anybody...but this year, I really want either Eleanor/Tahani or gen focused on Eleanor and Tahani (with pretty much anyone else welcome to appear as a supporting character, as I do love everyone). Show me the two of them getting their friendship back on track now that Michael's given up the constant rebooting, and maybe Eleanor rediscovering that she might legit be into Tahani! I'd really love anything from pure comedy to smut to something much deeper and more thoughtful (not that these are mutually exclusive). In every iteration, Eleanor knows right away she was meant for the Bad Place, while Tahani easily believes she belongs in the Good Place and takes it much harder when she finds out she doesn't...maybe explore Tahani dealing with that revelation, and Eleanor helping her through it? Or hey, what about that one iteration where they were soulmates? Was that the one time Tahani made it to Mindy's house in the Medium Place? Does Jason have any totally accidental wisdom to help push them together? Really, please go wild...heaven knows canon has!

Arrested Development 
George Oscar \"Gob\" Bluth, Tony Wonder

So, we are definitely (FINALLY) getting new AD again in 2018, so I would definitely love some Gob/Tony to help get me pumped for it! These two idiots were the best part of Season 4 IMHO, and I would love to see them somehow break out of the roofie circle and actually find the happiness they do not even begin to deserve, because terrible people developing genuine feelings for each other while still being absolutely terrible (to each other, to themselves, and to others around them) is among my favorite things. I think it would be particularly hilarious if all the drama around Lucille 2's apparent murder and the accidental FakeBlock scam and Lindsay's political campaign is playing out around them and has all the other Bluths in frantic damage control mode, but Gob hardly even what's going on (unless/until it involves them, because Sally almost certainly would throw Tony under the bus to save her own skin), because he's so preoccupied by his own confusing feelings. And/or just trapped in his own roofie circle. (Heh, if you like crossovers, maybe said circle finally ends with Gob and Tony both overdosing and/or getting murdered as a result of the others' scheming and ending up as \"soulmates\" in \"The Good Place.\") Basically, go wild. Bring the funny, and I'm on board.

Hot Fuzz (2007) 
Danny Butterman, Nicholas Angel

Yeah, so...I love this movie, and I love Nicholas and Danny, and yes, I ship it. I absolutely 100% ship it, but I'll happily read gen if you don't! I'd be up for anything post-movie, from casefic to hurt/comfort to slow-build romantic shipfic to pure comedy where the other cops just say \"piss it\" and shove them together, because while Danny would probably be clear-headed about the fact that he's fallen in love with Nicholas, Nicholas is canonically *terrible* at feelings and would likely worry about everything -- whether Danny returned his feelings, whether it would ruin their friendship, whether he'd just be destined to screw everything up again like he did with Janine, whether he'd be taking advantage, not to mention the ethical implications now that he's technically Danny's boss, etc. (Re: \"gay revelation\" angst, some amount of it is fine, but if you do go this route, I'd prefer it be more along the lines of \"figuring oneself out\" rather than any really dark internalized homophobia. Nicholas at least strikes me as highly unlikely to think it's *wrong*, but also a bit repressed and maybe some measure of grey-area asexual, such that he's just never given it much thought.)

...or you could just skip all that and go with an established relationship, whatever floats your boat. ;) Either way, bonus points for Doris showing up to make at least one horrific but very, very accurate double entendre.

As far as plot ideas, if you want to write something more than just shipfic or you'd prefer to write gen...I love actual plot, so have at it! If you have your own idea already, do that! I look forward to it. If you prefer prompts, though...maybe they've been called into assist with strange goings-on in another mad small town? (If you're at all into crossovers, maybe old and grey Steed and Mrs Peel have taken up temporary residence there to conduct their own investigation?) Or maybe Nicholas is called back to the Met to help with something there, and brings Danny along? Anything!

Pushing Daisies 
Ned (Pushing Daisies), Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles, Lily Charles, Vivian Charles

Now that Lily and Vivian finally have Chuck back in their lives...what's next? Seriously, what's next? \"I'm alive\" makes for a lovely ending to the series, but c'mon, there's going to be a next. And sure, I'm perfectly convinced it all works out in the end, but it *is* going to take some working out. Are Lily and Vivian furious with Ned? Does he properly explain his powers to them? What about the *huge* loose end involving Charles Charles still being alive? Does Lily, in turn, have some bombshell information for Vivian and Charlotte about just what kind of slimeballs Charles and Dwight Dixon really were? Is Ned's father somehow the least evil of the three? (I mean, seriously. It would take a hell of a lot of backstory to make the case that his abandonment of Ned and later of Maurice and Ralston was somehow in any way necessary and he's not a bad guy at all -- though if you think you can make that case, go for it! -- so he probably is, at least, not a great guy, but given his rescue of Ned and Olive, is he maybe not as bad as they think? And would Lily know that and be able to tell Ned? Hell, would she want to tell him, given that she's probably pissed as hell that he kept the secret of her daughter being alive again?) If you want to bring in Olive, does she somehow help them solve their issues (and does *she* finally get let into the loop herself, as she so richly deserves)? Feel free to keep this as light or as serious in tone as you want, and to bring in any other characters you want!

Dark Tower - Stephen King 
Susannah Dean (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Susan Delgado (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Roland Deschain (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Eddie Dean (Dark Tower - Stephen King)

Please see letter for even more details.

This is a \"please write about some assortment of these characters\" request, not a \"you must write about all of them\" request. Though if you want to write an AU that involves all four of them, that would be awesome.

I would love ka-tet fic; I didn't request Jake and Oy only due to the character limit but I love them too so feel free to include them. I'd also be happy with a pre-Jake story with just Roland, Eddie, and Susannah. Or a story with just Roland and Susan. Etc. I really like how the characters relate to each other, so I would prefer a story with more than one of them... unless you want to just write about Susan. I would be completely happy with that. I like Susan a lot and there's a lot of story possibilities that would make more sense with just her.

If you want to write about Susan, I'd love to see what might have happened to her if she'd survived, with or without Roland. What would have gone differently if she'd become a part of his Alain-Cuthbert-Jamie ka-tet? Would she and Roland have ended up questing for the Tower, and maybe caught in the endlessly repeating cycle together, growing ever-older, more knowledgeable, and wearier? If she survived but Roland died, would she have inherited his guns and his quest? Would she have gone questing with their child, maybe a daughter, mirroring him with Jake?

Or, to be less epic, I loved the world and the character relationships, so I would also be totally happy with a day-in-the-life that shows more of Mid-World and more of the characters. Or a day-in-the-life beyond the doors. I loved every minute of Roland reacting to our world. We saw how he felt about Pepsi--imagine him at an ice cream parlor.

DNW: Rape, really gross descriptions, Jake/anyone. Please don't do anything worse than happens to the characters in canon; note that this gives you plenty of leeway. ;)

The Stand - Stephen King 

Please see letter for even more details - I have prompts for all the characters.

I love this book for its haunting vision of travel across an empty America, its small community on the edge of destruction, and its characters. 

So, characters: seriously, any of them, in any combination. Also, feel free to bring in anyone in canon not in the tagset. I initially meant to just request the characters I'd nominated, but when I saw the others in the tagset I kept changing my mind about which four to request, and I finally decided not to decide. Please decide for me. ;)

I love the leads and the minor characters, and I would be happy with a day in the life or an untold adventure or some sort of canon AU. What if Nick had been just in time to prevent the bomb instead of just too late? What if different characters ended up in Boulder or in Vegas? I really liked how it wasn't a clear split between good and evil, with apparently basically decent people like Angie Hirschfeld ending up in Vegas and some real jerks in Boulder. What made people choose as they did? What if choice or chance led them another way? What if some of the people who meant to flee Vegas, like Jenny Engstrom, did so earlier and escaped or met up with the travelers on the road?

DNW: Graphic gross descriptions. On-page rape. I don't like Dayna's rape backstory in the extended edition; please don't reference it. Flagg's general rapeyness with Nadine is fine, and if you do an AU where Nadine survives her encounter with him, referencing it is fine too. Basically don't add additional rape to what's already in canon, and you're fine.

While scary, bittersweet, melancholy, or even hearbreaking moments (or a general mood) are fine - it's obviously not a fluffy canon - please don't do anything worse to the characters than happens in canon. (Except for Flagg. Torture him all you like. ;) ) If there's hurt, I'd like comfort too. If there's tragedy, I'd also like some hope.

Ki and Vandien Quartet - Megan Lindholm 
Vandien (Ki and Vandien Quartet), Ki (Ki and Vandien Quartet)

Please see letter for more details.

I love the strange creatures of the world, and how they seem more like science fiction aliens than fantasy beings. But most of all, I love Ki and Vandien and their relationship, and how it’s solidly built on friendship and camaraderie.

I would like a story about Ki and Vandien. Feel free to set it at any time in their relationship, from right after they first get back together in Harpy’s Flight, to after the end of Luck of the Wheels. There’s a number of important points in their relationship that happen off-page, like when they first have sex, when they first get serious, etc, that would be fun to explore. Or you could pick up on any of the dropped story threads: do they ever meet Janie again? Or the Harpies? Or the Brurjans? (I love the Brurjans.) Does Ki ever learn more about the mysterious aspects of her past? Does she ever meet Vandien’s horrible family and give them hell? 

DNW: Canon character or pet animal death. (Deaths of monster animals or hunting for food is fine.) If someone dies in canon, referencing it's fine, but please don't kill any canon characters who don't die in canon. Depressing endings. (Bittersweet is fine.) Sexual violence.

Earthsea - Ursula K. Le Guin 
Vetch (Earthsea), Penthe (Earthsea), Yarrow (Earthsea)

Please see letter for more details - I have prompts for all the characters. 

The first two books of this series are two of my favorite fantasies of all time. I like the others to varying degrees, but those are my favorites. The characters I requested are meant as a \"I would be happy with any of them\" prompt, NOT as a \"you must include them all\" prompt. I love all the nominated characters (well, to read about; I don't love Kossil as a person) so feel free to include any of the ones I didn't request. I very nearly requested \"any,\" but upon reflection I decided to go for my favorite characters who have very little fic about them. 

DNW: Character or animal death. Depressing endings. Sexual violence, child abuse, domestic violence, anything along those lines. Sex more explicit than canon (i.e., it can clearly be taking place but we don't know exactly what's going where when.)

Tale of the Five Series - Diane Duane 

Please see letter for more details - I have prompts for all the characters. 

I love the sense of wonder mixed with mundane detail, with the doors leading to other worlds where if you reach your hand through you can feel the heat of the air, the innkeeper who turns out to be the Goddess, telepathy that can be wondrous or just annoying, the tenderness and love the characters feel for each other, the sweet sensuality, the defiant optimism in a world that is centrally constructed around the acknowledgment of death, and the beauty and harshness of the flame that everyone wants and that kills you young. 

I love all these characters and would be happy with an ensemble story or with any pair (or pairing) of them, or a solo story. I also love the characters who were not nominated, so if you want to bring in Freelorn or Sunspark, say, that's totally fine.

DNW: Canon character or animal death. (Deaths of monster animals like the nightmare are fine.) If someone dies in canon, referencing it's fine, but please don't kill any canon characters who don't die in canon. Depressing endings. Bittersweet is fine, and I love the specific type of bittersweet in this canon, of self-sacrifice and heroic last stands and willingly giving one's life to a doomed but righteous cause. I am fine with an OC heroically sacrificing their life. Referencing the canon rape backstory is fine but please don't add additional rape to what's already in canon.

Aldnoah.Zero (Anime & Manga) 
Slaine Troyard, Klancain (Aldnoah.Zero)

I love this canon's dramatic plots in action, so if you are interested in writing gen and/or worldbuilding, I couldn't help thinking that the series ended with a brilliant set-up for the scandal to be uncovered in the far future, and for the specter of Terrorist Slaine Troyard who ought to have been executed be revealed somehow. What sort of legacies have been left by Asseylum's decisions? Could the people involved find common ground? Even if Slaine and Klancain have shared interests, can they support her effectively? And of course, how will the people who knew and didn't know cope with the consequences of the truth?

If you're interested in writing character-focused content or (my little heart can hope) shipfic, I'd love for curiosity to get the better of Klancain when it comes to Slaine (as a person and as a part of Asseylum). Since they traded barbs about Count Cruhteo's influence, Klancain having met Slaine near to his worst self, I would love something involving Klancain's curiosity about the wreck of a human being that Slaine is and what exactly is in him that Asseylum can't bear to lose him even though his (wretched) survival is the sort of secret that could topple empires. How could someone so smart make so many wrong choices? Casual intrigue leads to interpersonal drama and deepening entanglements! Learning about his empress through her dearest and most troubled choices in crisis could be in a series of vignettes.
Jealousy and possessiveness and power dynamics?! I'm curious to see what shape the tension between them takes.

If you want to just take these two and their weird connections and do a fantasy reimagining, I might cry tears of joy.

Flip Flappers (Anime) 
Cocona (Flip Flappers), Yayaka (Flip Flappers)

Yayaka's storyline broke my heart in this show, I love her and her ferocious ambition and her concern for Cocona. I'd love anything that explores their friendship or their corner of the YaPiCo love triangle-- during the past when Yayaka established herself as Cocona's friend or in the moments when those feelings became real. Yayaka's struggle to accept herself and her feelings over the course of the show felt to me very much like struggling with compulsory heterosexuality and the way teens sometimes wrestle with untangling platonic and romantic loves. How does their experience of each other and their friendship blossom once deceit is out of the way?

The two of them exploring Pure Illusion together, or dealing with the doors/gates into the emotional landscapes of others and reality shifts their actions within them cause could also make for a very interesting story-- What sort of previous experience with those gates did Yayaka have to warn Cocona not to mess with them? What repercussions are there for meddling in and with them over time?

selector infected WIXOSS 
Kurebayashi Kazuki, Kurebayashi Yuzuki

Warning: This is a request for canonical twincest.

So, I keep thinking about Kazuki's feelings being ambiguous and the implication that wishes have to have the selector's own direct action to come true or create the \"win conditions\" of the game. There's Yuzuki's inference that the dreams have to be possible to come true, a very tidy way for her to resolve any guilt about changing her brother's feelings for her with magic-- though it could also be that her desire to be with him publicly and openly changes the world they'll grow into rather than their feelings. If you want to go down a dark path, Kazuki's experience of feeling his worldview change and being unable to return to the state he knows he was in before would make for an awesome horror story. 

That said, I also love Yuzuki and want her to be happy, even if that (to her) means sibling incest happily ever after, with the loving support of her friends. Their first time or struggling to keep under wraps to the rest of the world, any engagement with the rest of their family, or making their time together count and the lengths they go to in order to be and stay together would be fun and interesting, too. I just couldn't believe they got as close to a happy end as this canon seems to offer just about anyone, despite the odds.

機動戦士ガンダム 鉄血のオルフェンズ | Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans 
Yamagi Gilmerton, Kudelia Aina Bernstein, Atra Mixta, Chad Chadan

Heartwrenching and/or uplifting post-canon or timeskip content for some of my precious surviving cast is the gist of what I am going for, with a heavy dose of found family. They deserve to get to be happy and feel safe and loved! It is my deepest hope that this crop of characters have beautiful romantic moments of joy AND MAYBE SOME ANGST OR SURVIVORS GUILT ABOUT THAT because they're all so keenly aware of the absences in their lives going forward. I would love to see the four of them working a healthier, happier future and encouraging one another to move forward. If you want to aim for a plot that doesn't center romance and recovery, practical concerns about building their new identities and their integration into their post-canon lives would be super satisfying for me. 

On the shipping fronts, regarding Atra and Kudelia, I would so love something about their OBVIOUS MARRIAGE DURING THE TIMESKIP or fretful preparation for Akatsuki's birth or far-future sitting together in rockers looking out at the farm! The Tekkadan-Admoss Foundation crew dealing with Kudelia's work pulling her away from the family and sweet reunions would be wonderful. I want to see them take on adulthood together in this world they made. 

If you are more interested in their bond growing while they are working with Tekkadan, I would really enjoy their time in space together, and Atra's firm resolve to build loving connections and the rejection of rivalry in their dynamic. Atra grounding Kudelia with loving openness, and Kudelia sharing her hopes and plans so that the two of them can see it through together. They are so precious to each other from the start, I really enjoy the way their bond evolves along friendship and respect to loving comfort. Laying in each other's arms talking about hope, inspiring each other to be the version of themselves their kids will need...They can save the world. Chad noticing Yamagi and slowly examining his own feelings as they push ever-forward...The foundations being laid for the future we're shown could be just a few moments of meaningful interactions. I was so delighted to see Chad blushing and getting teased about wanting to take out Yamagi after the timeskip, I would love something set during those ~5 years showing the path Chad and Yamagi took growing closer and maybe finding the beginning of a relationship, or something post-canon focusing on what they seem to be reaching for in each other even after the many tragedies of their lives. I love the idea of Chad's gentle warmth reaching Yamagi across his grief and Yamagi's sharpness leaving Chad feeling like he is totally readable/obvious while they both struggle through their feelings.

I JUST WANT THEM TO FIND HAPPINESS TOGETHER SOMEDAY ;0; Finally admitting how they feel over a drink or three? Awkward deliberate courtship or accidental realization that they are already kind of dating? I will be so happy for these two to curl up together in a corner of engine maintenance or administration and just be close and happy, after everything. I love domesticity for them if you feel like showing one crystallized moment of connection-- like Chad with his hair wrapped for night-time and Yamagi still grease-smudged from system work sharing hot tea with rum in the small hours when the rest are sleeping, or helping with the kids at Dante's or on the farm.

Tenkuu no Escaflowne | The Vision of Escaflowne 
Dilandau Albatou, Celena Schezar, Jajuka (Escaflowne)

Protective Lion Boyfriend!!!! Dilandau so desperately needed positive connections, the impact of discovering Jajuka in the series and their backstory was a hugely intense part of the canon for me. I just love the brief, intense glimpses of their time together and I NEED MORE OF THAT. I would love anything exploring their relationship, especially if it folds in Dilandau's trauma around his identity and what his position demands of him. Moments of comfort, moments of distress or dismay, and the sense that there is a force beyond all of their power pushing and pulling people and events-- the atmosphere of clinging to one another or losing everything and the devotional desperation Jajuka has to preserve even an ounce of safety for Dilandau buried somewhere within themselves is amazing. Formative bonds and love and co-dependence are all candy I will devour. If you feel like exploring Jajuka's mixed feelings about what he can do for Dilandau and Celena and what he IS doing and whether or not it is really helpful I will be delighted, having failed to find Jajuka stuff before. How has he helped Celena and Dilandau to coexist within one another, or can they?

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Hiraga Josef Kou, Roberto Nicholas

- Casefics, casefics, all the casefics, all the deliciously weird casefics with all the life-and-death situations you can think of. Cave-ins! Blizzards! Death traps rooms! Ambushes and kidnappings! Cuddling for warmth! Protecting each other! More snakebites and weird amazing hallucinations! Evil cultists! Helpful application of sulphuric acid!
- Alternately, I have this craving for the strange domesticity of their Vatican life; maybe Roberto and Hiraga moving together and navigating the shores of their life together? Dinners and shopping and taking care and this easy, benign understanding they have for each other (honestly, I was dead and gone on the canon from their very scene together, where Hiraga admits to playing his game for the whole night in hopes that it would somehow help his little brother, and Roberto just going with it without missing a beat - and then, well, going to clean and iron for Hiraga, as one does).
- For some reason I'd really love an old-fashioned sickfic for this fandom. Fever, pain, tender care, gentle blanket-tucking... It just feels like it would really suit. (Somehow I feel it combines well with the previous option)
- I'm sure this wasn't the last time Julia had tried to convert them both to his case, and the events in the finale will most definitely come back to haunt them. So, how?
- Somebody once described Roberto's feelings for Hiraga as 'pining while already being in committed relationship,' and just. Yes. Hiraga is at once so obviously full of love, and so oblivious of it, that there are endless possibilities for angst here, and I want all of them.
- ...on unrelated note, I feel like this is the canon where I can actually mention, in Yuletide, that I have a crucifixion kink a mile wide. So, I have a crucifixion fic a mile wide, and Roberto is an ideal candidate.
- Bonus option: If you like to serious-ify a cracky canon, go for it! The show uses a very anime kind of Catholicism, mostly aesthetics and trappings, but I'm fascinated with how injecting a bit of the real deal will change things (or not): the actual everyday application of faith, you know? For example, we know from the novels that Hiraga is a true believer but Roberto mostly treats his position as a job that gives him access to old books; I wonder if the canon events changed it, for both of them.
- A completely non-obligatory bonus ridiculous crossover option on the chance you're into VME and Wynnona Earp at once: how would Roberto and Hiraga deal with the case that includes actual magic and demons from Hell?

If you like Lauren, I'm of the opinion that Lauren makes everything better (and makes for an ideal outsider's POV). 

Fandom-specific DNW caveat:
- For me, the allure of this relationship, given that both of them are priests, is that they are completely devoted to each other, but they're also at peace with being celibate. I'd prefer to see the same setup in fic - so, no sex between them, and also no angst about having to be celibate.

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades. I love hurt/comfort mostly within the context of a relationship (not necessarily romantic - filial ties, friendship, brothers-in-arms comradeship, whichever fits), as an opening for one character to be hurt and for the other to be outraged/terrified/comforting on their behalf.
- Found families, tight friendships, us-against-the-world, people finding and keeping each other, providing kindness and warmth against the dark.
- Hope and kindness, Clair universes, stories where the entropy tries its hardest but doesn't win.
- Loyalty in all forms! From ritualized (oaths, kneeling, ring-kissing, knights and bodyguards and henchmen and so on) to more casual ways, like standing up for your friends.
- Self-sacrifice (metaphorical and quite literal) and martyrdom (ditto).
- Non-mundane, tropey AUs - space opera! high fantasy! historical! pirates!
- Outsider POVs.

General DNWs:
- Character death.
- Infidelity and partner betrayal of any kind.
- Hurt without comfort.
- A/B/O universes and mpreg.

琅琊榜 | Nirvana in Fire (TV) 
Lin Shu | Mei Changsu | Su Zhe

I've left other character fields blank because I think he interacts gloriously with just about anybody. There will be some specific characters mentioned in the prompts below, but if you like the prompt and think it would work better with a different person, ignore the character suggestion altogether!
Same with shipping: I think MCS is very much a little black dress of this fandom, so if you have a specific ship in mind (Jingyan, Nihuang, Lin Chen, Meng Zhi, Jingrui, hell, even Liyang, anybody else) - go for it! I literally love everybody in this bar. 

So:
- In general, MCS goaded so far beyond his (emotional or physical) endurance that he has to actually admit he needs help and accept it.
- MCS surviving the end of the story and being forced to live with himself (for however long it is): a long, slow recovery, the life after revenge and death he never thought he could have, dealing with all these bits and pieces of himself and other people he thought he would never have to deal with.
- MCS and his household - fretting over him, doing his bidding, dealing with the fallout of his schemes, passing judgement on his favored and disfavored people, preparing for holidays and so on. I loved his interactions with Li Gang and Zhen Ping and Fei Liu so, so much.
- MCS and Jiangzhuo Alliance - his rise to power, his politics, the way he made it flourish; mostly because I fell in love with him from the very first scene when he floated out in this ridiculous self-steering boat with his flute and three warships full of soldiers just about died in terror. You know? COMPETENCE PORN.
- Some kind of scenario where people of the capital come to MCS during his stay there for a solution for their problems because the rumors travel quickly that he can solve them, and he does, a-la Sherlock Holmes, just to keep his hands busy (and maybe gather favors).
- This might be a bit of an overkill for a canon like NiF, but literally any kind of h/c, casefic scenario you can think about? Bring it on. Like huddling for warmth (was there ever a character made more perfectly for the huddling for warmth trope than MCS?), or caved-in, or a kidnapping, or recovering from the wounds, or being caught in an ambush, or being imprisoned in a dungeon (AGAIN), or being interrogated (AGAIN AGAIN), or what have you.
- People forcing MCS to admit that they quite literally love him (or came to love him) as Mei Changsu, as this new persona, and kind of guiding him towards loving himself as Mei Changsu too. Or at least forgiving himself, for surviving. 

And so on, and so on, this is only a tiny sliver I can think of; honestly, give me anything, please, because there are only so many times I can rewatch those fifty-four episodes.

And some fandom specific DNW caveats:
- The setting and the setup are a huge part of the enjoyment for me, so this is the fandom where I'd prefer not to read AUs or canon divergence stories (until it's the finale or post-finale canon divergence), soulbonding AUs and such.
- Stories set before the present storyline (in short, I'm interested in MCS-LS but not Lin Shu only as Lin Shu). 

The same things that worked for me in the show would work for me in fics: hurt/comfort, sarcasm, dramatic irony, plot twists, complicated relationships, friendship and loyalty, people being really reverent with their mothers, determination and self-sacrifice, the way everybody fusses over MCS-LS, the warmth of the household interludes, the whiplash between epic and mundane. 

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades.

Pyre (Video Game) 
Hedwyn (Pyre), Jodariel (Pyre), The Moon-Touched Girl (Pyre), Rukey Greentail

I was blown away by how gorgeous and how kind this game was, melancholy but not hopeless, and how hard it leaned on found family tropes, and how fast and how hopelessly I was invested in the fates of all the new Nightwings, together and apart, but especially the core crew, the ones you begin with. So I'd love to read something about them in whatever permutation of events, finding their way to each other. 

(Feel free to include each and every other character, if you're so inclined, ditto the Reader; mine was of a female/disabled/scholar persuasion). 

Some ideas!
- All of them upside, building a new life together alongside with Volfred's revolution.
- Some went up and some stayed down: missing each other, or writing letters to each other, or literally moving heaven and earth to meet again because they can't not.
- Moon-Touched Girl upside, the accidental Prophet of the Scribes, and the way the rest of them keep her safe and grounded.
- Sort of an orphanage pre-canon AU where Jodariel takes care of all of them, not just Hedwyn?
- All of them left below, after the end, making the Downside into something to fit in rather than a place of exile;
- Just general... caretaking, trauma recovery scenarios, in whatever combination: sharing pasts, teaching each other to love and live, providing shelter in the storm.
- Weird adventures on the road when it's just four or them (plus or minus the Reader), before the big games begin - Howler ambushes and tales around the campfire and exhaustion of the travel and kind of horrible but still beautiful sights, and the stars.
- Space opera, of the rickety-ship-stern-captain-hapless-stowaway persuasion?
- Some kind of procedural with a tough detective Jodariel and her original and accidental wards?

Mostly I'm just very, very, ridiculously invested in the ties between the four of them, forever, always.

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it.

For me those movies were all about her rise and downfall, and I want a story, any story about her - I've left the other character slots open to give you the most flexible timeline choice, so please feel free to include whoever you want, I love (or love to hate) all of them. Some possible prompts:

- Her backstory, rise to power, political maneuvering that went into her taking over the palace, et cetera. Did she have friends, did she have lovers, how did she make her alliances, did she want to be the one to hold the country together or did she do it out of duty?
- Sivagami and her serving ladies (femslash or gen are both good!).
- Her relationship with Amarendra's mother prior to the lady's death; was there more to her adopting Amarendra as her own beloved son than what we're shown?
- More on her relationship with Amarendra before everything went to shit, because the beginning of the second movie, with the interrupted ritual and them him caring for her when she was sick brought me so, so much joy.
- Sivagami and Kattappa, oaths and loyalty and trust and overwhelming love they shared for Baahubali the senior, and the way it all fell apart (or maybe didn't).
- ...Some fix-its please? The most heartwrenching thing in the whole movie for me was that they didn't have a chance to reconcile before Amarendra died. A story where things didn't go wrong, an afterlife reunion, some redemption?
- And in the fixit AU vein, Sivagami and Devasena overcoming the initial clusterfuck of their acquaintance and working together, in whatever capacity? Mentor and pupil, or friends, or even respectful enemies, but with more - sense of each other.
- Or Sivagami who lived and raised Baahubali in the village below in full knowledge of his inheritance?
- Or just AUs, because I could see her being a terrifying loving mother and grandmother BAMF in literally whatever universe and position she chose to occupy. Ruthless politician Sivagami, pirate queen Sivagami, High Priestess Sivagami, just, ahh. 

...and more, and more, and more. If you're into unusual formats, maybe her letters (I'm sure she's a very, hm, direct correspondent), or some later legends concerning her, or an epic song about her rule, et cetera. Just - more of her please. 

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades. I love hurt/comfort mostly within the context of a relationship (not necessarily romantic - filial ties, friendship, brothers-in-arms comradeship, whichever fits), as an opening for one character to be hurt and for the other to be outraged/terrified/comforting on their behalf.
- Found families, tight friendships, us-against-the-world, people finding and keeping each other, providing kindness and warmth against the dark.
- Hope and kindness, Clair universes, stories where the entropy tries its hardest but doesn't win.
- Loyalty in all forms! From ritualized (oaths, kneeling, ring-kissing, knights and bodyguards and henchmen and so on) to more casual ways, like standing up for your friends.
- Self-sacrifice (metaphorical and quite literal) and martyrdom (ditto).
- Non-mundane, tropey AUs - space opera! high fantasy! historical! pirates!
- Outsider POVs.

General DNWs:
- Character death.
- Infidelity and partner betrayal of any kind.
- Hurt without comfort.
- A/B/O universes and mpreg.
- Grimdark stories and unhappy endings.
- PWPs.

All Seeing Eye - Rob Thurman 
Jackson Lee Eye, Hector Allgood

OK, the first thing I should say about this canon is that I really enjoy all of the other nominated characters (Abigail \"Abby\" (All Seeing Eye), Meleah Guerrera), as well, and if you want any of them to make appearances, I’m more than good with that. ^_^ So why request this particular set of characters?

One of the most compelling parts of the book to me is the enemies-to-friends(-to-lovers? ^_~) thing going on between Jackson and Hector. I absolutely love the entire arc of their developing friendship from angry and antagonistic to deep-seated trust and practical co-dependency. Anything that looks at that friendship (or romance, if you want to look at it that way!) through that lens is something I’d really enjoy.

More specific prompts available in my DYA letter.

DNWs (do not wants):
1) I prefer to keep other kinds of AUs (i.e. coffeehouse AUs, high school AUs, etc.) to my larger fandom explorations. For exchanges, I prefer to stay closer to actual canon.
2) I have a huge fealty/loyalty kink, and discussions of infidelity/cheating/going behind someone's back/etc., make me highly uncomfortable. So, if you could avoid that kind of thing, I'd appreciate it.
3) I have a huge embarrassment/public humiliation squick, so if you could avoid that, I'd be grateful.
4) I’m a veterinarian and an animal lover and any talk of animal abuse or animal death makes me really upset. So, if there are any animals in your stories, I’d appreciate it if none of them were hurt or killed, and that they are all treated with care and respect. Thanks!
5) The following kinks: Age play/infantalism, scat, watersports, a/b/o dynamics/omegaverse. Basically, if I haven't listed it as something I'd like for a particular story, please just don't include it. Thanks!

Either way, though, I just really, really love him and would love to see more of him. ^_^ I also have no objection to the other characters in the tagset (Daemon Sadi, Jaenelle Angelline, Karla (Black Jewels), Saetan SaDiablo, Surreal SaDiablo) making appearances in the story.

Dark Is Rising Sequence - Susan Cooper 
Bran Davies (Dark Is Rising), Will Stanton

I don’t remember exactly when I first read these books, but they’ve been perennial favorites for some time. I’ve been meaning to request them for Yuletide for years and keep managing to forget. NOT THIS YEAR. Anyway, what I love about them is that old-time myth and legend feel and how connected they feel to autumn and winter for me. I honestly can’t even put it into words. Suffice to say, I love them, and every time I come back to them, they still manage to feel fresh and new, like I remember the overall shape of them but the details blur between readings. As such, I haver fewer plot-related prompts to offer, as I’m still in the middle of my current reread, but if there’s something specifically plot-related you want to explore, I’m totally down for that, too.

I’ll also be up front about this: I ship Bran and Will a LOT. It’s that deep, almost mystical connection between the two of them that exists from the moment they meet that utterly captivates me. However, if you’re more into exploring that on a platonic/gen level, I’m down for that, too. ^_^ As mentioned in the general likes/dislikes section, I also have a HUGE fealty/loyalty kink, and Will and Bran definitely have a healthy helping of that going on. It may look different because this is modern day, but it’s clear in many of their interactions that Will kind of… belongs to Bran, very much in a king/vassal kind of way. He has all this power at his beck and call, and you just get the feeling that nothing would make him happier than to lay that all at Bran’s feet for whatever he needs. Very “command me and I’m yours,” and I LOVE that dynamic. Not so sure I’d be into that playing out in a sexual way, though, if you want to take this in a shippy direction. I like them on more equal footing when it comes to relationship explorations.

Ephemera Series - Anne Bishop 
Danyal (Ephemera), Lee (Ephemera)

It occurs to me that I have re-read a lot of Anne Bishop this year and it really shows in my sign-ups. O_o;;; ANYWAY. For some reason, with each passing re-read, I fall further and further in love with these two characters. I am always a sucker for the self-sacrificing types who may angst quietly to themselves but would never even dream of not helping the people who need them. And both of these characters fit into that archetype, though Lee a bit more so than Danyal. More importantly, though, I absolutely love how they manage to get each other past that and form a truly supportive and thriving partnership where both can live fully up to their strengths and potential. And, for the record, I love their canon friendship, but I’d also love to see them romantically shipped, so whichever way you want to go there is fine by me!

Tir Alainn Trilogy - Anne Bishop 
Morag (Tir Alainn Trilogy), Ashk (Tir Alainn Trilogy), Padrick (Tir Alainn Trilogy)

…I mentioned I was doing a lot of Anne Bishop re-reading this year, yes? Third and last time she appears in the requests. ^_^ SO. I love these three. I just really, really do. I love Ashk and Morag’s friendship, how well they understand each other, how, in each other, they’ve finally found someone else who can match their strength, who wouldn’t be afraid of them just because of who they are. I love Padrick and Ashk’s relationship, how Padrick not only accepts, but revels, in Ashk’s strength but still looks for opportunities to pamper her and show her a little softness, how he loves the Green Lady and respects and follows the Hunter and everything in between. And I love Padrick and Morag’s friendship, how he treats her to that same tough love and kindness that he does Ashk, how he revels in the fact that he gets to stand by her side and see that she’s taken care of, not just because Ashk would want it, but because, in his own way, he loves her, too. I love how he sees so easily that Morag has been starved for simple things like friendship and affection from all but her sister and is eager to coddle her and take of her, but is equally easy with stepping aside and accepting her lead, how he just lets her be who she is, like Ashk. I just love the entire dynamic between these three. ^___________^

The White Mists of Power - Kristine Kathryn Rusch 
Abington Byron Adric, Seymour (The White Mists of Power - Kristine Kathryn Rusch)

I loved this book so much as a kid, so much so that I think it influenced a lot of the tropes (…and kinks) I now love as an adult. There was something about it that just stuck with me, and I ended up revisiting it so many times over the course of my life that it’s become a comfort book for me. And one of the most compelling parts of the story to me is the relationship between Byron and Seymour. Byron, the charming bard and sometime rogue, who’s being hunted down for pissing off the wrong powerful lord once too often, but is determined to make a secure future for himself and for the people he comes to care about, too (like Seymour), and Seymour, the forever fearful amateur wizard, hunted by the same offended lord as Byron, his greatest crime being to be born the son of a great and powerful wizard… and not live up to his legacy. He wants nothing more than to hide away from everyone and everything and be a disappointment in peace, and yet somehow he and Byron make for the most unlikely of friends, a decision to help Byron being the thing that forces Seymour back into the land of the living, whether he wants it or not. That friendship, rocky though it often is, drives the entire story and I love everything about it.

Oxford Time Travel Universe - Connie Willis 
Kivrin Engle

Years after her brush with the Black Death Kivrin makes another journey through time. 

Yuletide friend, I always wondered what happened to Kivrin after her sojourn in the fourteenth century. Is she too traumatized to continue as a field historian? Does she stick to teaching in her own present day? Leave academia? Change disciplines? Keep on traveling to dangerous times, because she's sort of a badass? I’d kind of like to see her pushed to time travel again, maybe with some of the other beloved time traveling historians (Verity and Ned? I haven’t read Blackout/All Clear, so don’t know the others as well, but knock yourself out, include more characters if you wish). Also, I remember a statement in To Say Nothing of the Dog to the effect of “all history is a 10 for blacks” so they don’t time travel…which, no. Surely black historians also want to travel in time, even if it isn’t so easy for them to blend inconspicuously into the population of say, medieval England. I would be extra excited if Kivrin were to have a time traveling companion who pushes that boundary.

Brennu-Njáls saga | Njal's Saga 
Hallgerðr Hǫskuldsdóttir | Hallgerðr langbrók

I'd like to read more about Hallgerd than the saga(s) provide us. She is such a fascinating figure - and it is very clear the author of the Njals saga thinks so, too! He could have easily made her an evil bitch, yet chooses not to do so. I think there is a lot of points you could elaborate on. 

For example, what about her childhood? - I'm especially interested in her relationship with her mother and her brother Olaf Pai. (Was there a sibling rivalry - or did she maybe like him very much?) And where does her mysterious name \"longbrok\" come from?
Second, what about Thjostolf, her foster-father (that very much gives the impression of a would-be- or ex-lover, which today seems ...ahem... kinky)? Everyone in the saga seems to dislike him, only Hallgerd again and again excuses him (until he slays the husband she loves). Why?

And what makes her relationship to Glum seemingly the most healthy and loving relationship in her lifetime? What about little Thorgerd who loses her father? What does she think about her mother? (Heck, what does she think about her own strange bethrothal and marriage??? Thorgerd would be an absolutely fascinating person to write about. Feel absolutely free to write about Thorgerd!)
And Gunnar? Did Hallgerd ever truly love Gunnar - and if yes, why and when did she cease to do so? What did he see in her - not if all of his friends didn't warn him to not marry Hallgerd! 

You may absolutely write about all of the people in the tags (or anyone that merits a name in the saga) - yet I'm least interested in Bergthora.

Charité (TV) 
Schwester Therese

Da es derzeit keine englische Fassung gibt, ist es wohl okay, auf Deutsch zu schreiben. Mein größter Wunsch wäre auf jeden Fall: Mach's für die arme Schwester Therese wieder gut!!! Wenigstens ein bisschen!!! Ihre Story wurde ja so versaut, da weiß ich gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll. (Mehr dazu im Yuletide letter.)
Sie hat es sowas von verdient, zu Weihnachten ein bisschen Freude und Trost abzukriegen!
Ich glaube, es würde sich für eine Story vielleicht ganz gut eignen, einen Heiligabend in der Charité zu erzählen, was die verschiedenen Figuren da so erleben und wie sie feiern, auch wenn sie arbeiten müssen (oder es freiwillig tun). Es sollte trotz allem wenigstens ein bisschen schön für alle Figuren sein. Selbstverständlich kannst du gerne auch alle anderen Charas vorkommen lassen, speziell Ida und Oberin Martha bieten sich ja sehr an.

Kudrun 
Gerlint (Kudrun)

I really like the dynamics between the women of this epic. Especially Gerlint - Kudrun - Ortrun.
Gerlint  could have been shown so easily as simply the evil queen, but isn't. The author calls her \"she-wolf\" and tells of her cruel deeds and plans on Kudrun, yet in the same instance, shows her as competent queen, dutiful wife and loving mother who may have deserved death, but not like this and not what happened to her body. I love the complexity in this!
The relationship between Gerlint and Kudrun seems to have something of a hate-love, with not so little sexual undertones in the scene, where Gerlint plans to whip Kudurn by herself, with no one around. If you want to elaborate on this impression, I'm absoluteley fine with femslash.

And think of Ortrun, who seems to be the nicest person who ever lived! Caught between two stools, with her duty and love for her mother and brother - and on the other hand side her loyality and friendship (or is there even more?) for Kudrun. Comparing her to the other two women, she seems the weak one - but is she? She was the only one who dared to protest Kudrun's ill treatment - even if only by crying in public. 

And how did Hartmuot perceive all this? He seems a knight in shining armour, a good man through and through - and yet he did not gain the one he loved. 

Feel free to use as many people from the epic as you like. My favourite, though, would be Gerlint.

John Wick (Movies) 
John Wick (John Wick)

These prompts are far less involved than requests 2&amp;3 but please don't think I like it less, I just have less FEELINGS about this movie that need expositing and instead would love to see your take on anything! You really can't go wrong!

WORLDBUILD: I will love just about anything that examines the world John Wick lives in: the coins, the clothes, the guns, the bars, how does it all *work*? When does it break down? How does it get fixed? 

A few potential prompts:

John and his contacts! Who does he know, from where? I love the *respect* everyone has for him and what he was/is again.

John's (sex) life before his wife! (Porn optional) / John's INTRODUCTION to the life as a hitman.

John picking out his final inventory for his One Last Job with his wife watching on, *knowing* he will succeed.

John and his cars: I mean, it's clear he knows his wheels inside and out.

Who trained John? What was their relationship like? He had to learn the 'rules' somewhere.

Bonus points for anything involving folks having that turnpin reaction of 'Oh. John. I'l... leave you be\" due to his reputation. They're some of my favourite parts of the movie.

The Goblin Emperor - Katherine Addison 
Maia Drazhar, Cala Athmaza, Deret Beshelar, Kiru Athmaza

I received a wonderful Goblin Emperor fic last year but this is the story full of feelings I would love to roll in forever, so I have requested again!

Points I'd Love Expanded On:

Maia and the fallout from his childhood:
We get a few tiny slivers of reactions from the cast when they learn about Maia's history and abuse. I would love to see how the Nohechari discuss it among themselves, how it changes how they interact with Maia and those around Maia. How they translate that into Maia's coping mechanisms for safety, and how little he worries about his own physical self.

Maia and his Meditation/His Nohechari's Presence:
Cala and Deret both are surprised that Maia thinks they would judge him for his need to meditate. Why? They clearly judge and inform him prior to this. I'd love the pair of them realizing how on guard Maia is around them, that their actions have had this effect, and that it isn't a benefit to anyone - least of all Maia.

Maia And His Health/Food/Identity:  The novel constantly repeats subtle nods at Maia's health: he skips his meals or eats little, has no appetite, has awful headaches, refuses to look at himself in the mirror, and others comment and ask if he's well. I feel he's disassociating from himself as a way to handle how little he recognizes who he has become. How that could be remedied or resolved? I'd prefer this to focus on it being a result of stress and fixing the issue, not as Maia with an eating disorder.

Maia and his kidnapping: When Maia's questioned, after being kidnapped, he admits plainly that he'd have signed his abdication knowing that it would mean his death. He's upset about this, but also resigned. I would love a look into how little Maia values his own life beyond the power he represents, and how that affects his staff.

World Build Bonus points: The practice of Nohecharei have been an institution for centuries and are always provided by a set group: There's no way that nothing was written, over the years, about best care and practice of guarding your Emperor against harm both inside and out. What rules are they trying to follow, or break? Or is there really no guideline at all?

Tangled: The Series (Cartoon) 
Cassandra (Disney: Tangled), Rapunzel (Disney: Tangled the Series)

This is one of those series I want to love SO MUCH but I struggle with how often it goes halfway with its ideas. What I really want, more than anything else, is some serious conversations between Rapunzel and Cassandra - conversations they really need to be having!

((This is getting a canon review tomorrow so these statements may get adjusted))

Cassandra forces Rapunzel to lie for her - and threatens her if she doesn't. This isn't the act of a friend, this is an act of abuse. And Cassandra is not a bad person! I'd really love Cassandra - who is far more world aware than Rapunzel is, educated and self sufficient - I'd love her to realize how much she takes advantage of Rapunzel and how messed up Rapunzel is from being abused and gaslit by Gothel for her whole life?

I'd likewise love to see Rapunzel take a stand against her father, because what the HECK series?? Rapunzel has gone from one tower to another, and I know the series tries to frame it as 'not good' but when Rapunzel's mother's suggestion is 'just hide your exploits from your father' and Rapunzel never once points out the similarities of her parents AND Gothel, I'm disappointed.
I've dealt with abuse my whole life and really identify with Rapunzel, I suppose, but the show makes her dumb as a brick sometimes and I'd love to see her brilliance - she's a genius engineer and amazing artist - actually shine. I'd love to see her gain a backbone and be able to make boundaries for herself.

I'd love to get more of Duncan after the end of Mankind Divided, how he moves forward. He is such an ass at the beginning, and is still pretty much one at the end, but his world has clearly grown with repeated exposure to Jensen, and there's clearly more to him than we get through Jensen. And that's where, if you're amenable, I'd love love a story about two of them after the end of that game. A debrief, a drink after the war, that kind of thing. Anyway, the world obviously isn't fixed after the events of the game, but it seems like a good time to reassess, re-position, rethink things.

Nixie is one of those repeating characters I'd love to see all grown up. Maybe as she's headed to college, and knows just what she wants to do. Or as a full-on professional. For some reason, I feel she would go into law. As a lawyer, I mean, maybe because her dad was a lawyer and him trying to do the right thing is what started everything off. Probably also because I'm stuck on the idea of Roarke's young cousin Sean being the one who grows up to be a cop, and they've stayed in touch through Eve and Roarke's holiday gatherings, and end up on the same case with Eve a baffled background character. I have no idea. I just love Nixie's determination and grit and sense of right and wrong, and would love to see that in action.

Arabella Baylor, Catalina Baylor, Kyle Sherwood (Hidden Legacy), Leon (Hidden Legacy)

I'm okay with only some of the characters being present in the story (I think one with all four would be tricky!). I'm curious about the aftermath, but any story would please me.

Specific things I wonder about, in case any of them intrigue or interest you: Does Leon get talked out of the dark-horse idea? By who, and in favor of what? What is Catalina going to do now that her power is known? Arabella? (Honestly, for Arabella, the other thing that could be fun is getting in the Arbiters' heads during the testing! Well, or Catalina, but really, Arabella.) For Kyle...what's it like being Kyle or, alternately, what happens when Rynda is told that about his magic? They DO tell her, right?

The Lions of Al-Rassan - Guy Gavriel Kay 
Jehane bet Ishak, Miranda Belmonte, Ammar ibn Khairan, Rodrigo Belmonte

This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I'm sure I'll love anything you write! That said, I've always been interested in the canon gaps. For example, what else happened during the year Ammar and Rodrigo served in Ragosa? What was the Belmontes' marriage like before they had children? How did Jehane and Ammar adjust to Sorenica?

I am also interested in points at which the story might have turned and gone in a different direction. Such alternate paths are probably equally likely to end in tragedy, alas, but new and different flavors of bittersweet are worth sampling. *wry*

I like all ship types and am open to any combination of Jehane, Ammar, Rodrigo, and Miranda. My only caveat is that I dislike cheating, so any ship involving Rodrigo or Miranda with someone besides each other requires them to give permission beforehand. But I would prefer that you focus at least as much on plot, character development, and world-building as on any potential sex and/or romance.

The Saga of the Skolian Empire - Catherine Asaro 
Rocalisa Qox-Skolia

This request is both very specific and very open-ended. Here is the specific part: Lisi leaves Prism as a young adult (use whatever plot justification works best for you), and encounters the giant tangle of post-Radiance War interstellar politics and its ramifications for her family. Here is the open-ended part: literally everything else.

I admit that I would love you forever if you can get Lisi to meet any of her relatives either in person or via the psiberweb (which is why I nominated Jai, Kelric, and Dehya), but that is not strictly necessary. Other things that would be received with great joy but which are not requirements include some kind of action/adventure plot and/or a romance. If that romance happened to be lesbian and/or poly, I would be even more thrilled -- canon is sadly short on lesbians, though we did get Althor being both bi and poly -- but again, that is a bonus rather than a demand.

If that prompt is really not working for you, here are some other ideas for Lisi-centric stories. Tell me about her growing up on Prism, or about returning to Prism to rebuild. Tell me about her years living on Earth with Seth: did she make friends; did she have a cute teenage romance; how hard was it to keep all the necessary secrets; did she adopt any pieces of Earth culture like Jai adopted Catholicism; etc. Just, tell me something about Lisi!

For this prompt, a focus on romance is obviously fine, though I would appreciate if you also put equal emphasis on at least one of the following: family, secrets, or action/adventure.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Karen Page (Daredevil Comics), Milla Donovan (Daredevil Comics), Rebecca Blake (Daredevil Comics), Elektra Natchios (Daredevil comics)

I admit upfront this is a peculiar character combination, and I hereby absolve you of having to write all four characters if you can't think of a way to fit them into the same story. But I would really like to see at least two of them, and see them interacting in a way that involves their professional lives rather than their romantic histories with Matt.

In other words, I want some kind of case!fic wherein Karen and/or Milla and/or Becky and/or Elektra get to exercise their various professional skillsets to resolve a problem. The scale can be as large or small as you like. You can pick whatever time period works best for your plot. Matt (and other characters) can be involved or not, as you please, though I would like the women to be at least as instrumental to the eventual resolution as he is. And if you can think of ways to work in any of the other women who have touched Matt's life over the years (whether lovers, friends, or enemies), that would be extra specially cool. :)

I genuinely don't care what you do with ships in this fic -- ship any of them, ship all of them, ship none of them, whatever! -- but romance should really not be the focus here, please.

The Dispossessed - Ursula K. Le Guin 

This is also one of my all-time favorite books, and I am sure I will love any story you write for it. I am not at all fussy! I like the characters, the utopianism and related politics and philosophy, the crazy alien physics, the world-building for both Urras and Anarres, etc. I am also totally up for fic about \"The Day Before the Revolution\" and the rest of Laia Odo's life, if that strikes your fancy.

If you want plot hooks, I am fascinated by the way marriage (or the lack thereof) plays out in Anarresti society, and what that means for Shevek and Takver. Relatedly, family also seems to be a slippery concept and I'm sure that could lead to an interesting story centered around Sadik and her parents (or grandmother, perhaps?), or about the friend-groups Shevek and Takver construct around themselves. I am intrigued by the hints of Odo's own relationship with Taviri, and their joint activism. I enjoy the throwaway mentions of Urrasti legends and would love to see them turned into proper mythology. I am curious about the chaos in Benbili that was going on while Shevek was on Urras, and/or the reaction to his journey back on Anarres. I'd love to hear about Ambassador Keng's reaction to Urras both pre- and post-Shevek. Etcetera, etcetera -- there are infinite options!

I like all ship types, but I would prefer that you focus at least as much on plot, character development, and worldbuilding as on any potential sex and/or romance. Also, please do not have Shevek or Takver cheat on each other, though if you want to do something in a consensual poly direction, that's totally fine.

Shahr-e Sūkhté (Burnt City) RPF 
Tall Woman with Artificial Eye (Shahr-e Sūkhté)

So this is the second year in a row I learned about an archaeological site in the tagset and went instantly from zero knowledge to desperately wanting fic. I requested Tall Woman with Artificial Eyeball, but if you would rather write about a different era in the city's life, I'd also be fine with that.

The Innsmouth Legacy - Ruthanna Emrys 

If there’s a particular story you want to tell in this world, knock yourself out. I’m not   very well-versed in Lovecraft, but if there’s a Lovecraftian idea you’d like to see the characters deal with, I’m here for that. 

For all characters in this fandom, I’m less interested in backstory than in stories set after Winter Tide (or possibly during—I would like to see some of Charlie and Ron’s missing scenes). I’d love to see a future fic for Aphra dealing with the scope of her future—something set in the present day, or a hundred years from now, or a hundred thousand. But I’d also love a story about how she negotiates her relationships with Caleb, Charley, Neko, and Audrey over the next few months or years, or a story about Professor Trumbull settling back into her old life.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 

I would like post-trilogy fic about any of the nominated characters who are still alive at the end (for any value of alive). I’m especially interested in the small-scale community-building of the Castrimas in their new home, but take the story wherever you want to—this fandom has scope, and I would also happily read about the coming civilizations that Essun and Hoa will witness.

Ella Enchanted - Gail Carson Levine 
Prince Charmont (Ella Enchanted Book), Mandy (Ella Enchanted Book), Ella of Frell (Ella Enchanted Book), Areida (Ella Enchanted Book)

Ella Enchanted was one of my literary heroines growing up, hence the username! Some ideas for a fic: 

-post-epilogue, featuring Char and Ella's adventures around the world.
-modern au retelling of the story (Featuring university and college culture)
-post-epilogue, purely romantic story, maybe going into the wedding and their children, and daily life at court (more fairy drama, perhaps?)
_zombie au? scifi au? I'm a sucker for a good au.

With this fandom, the only restriction I'd say I'd like there to be is explicit sex. I'm ok with some kisses and petting, but as it's a childhood favorite, I'd feel weird reading about Char and Ella kink-negotiating, or having a threesome with Areida.

-a continuation of the fight scene where Elizabeth learns of Darcy's meddling with Jane and Bingley (perhaps more clothes are cut off in the fray?)
-a story set immediately after the wedding, and the uprising of zombies running toward them. what's next? do darcy and elizabeth ever get their wedding night?
-elizabeth and darcy training together. going off to war together. being zombie kicking badasses together.
-modern au perhaps? a retelling or continuation of the story in the modern age. 

I am totally ok with some explicit sex with this fandom. Just no zombies in the bedroom, please. :)

Stardew Valley (Video Game) 
Shane (Stardew Valley), Abigail (Stardew Valley), Penny (Stardew Valley), Leah (Stardew Valley)

This game is just the best ever, isn't it? Now, to clarify, the four characters I chose are the ones I most like in the game, but I don't need all of them to be in the fic. Frankly,the whole cast is welcome in the fic, so if you think someone would be best suited in the fic, go for it! I just ask that at least one of my chosen characters is the focus of the fic.

Prompts for this fandom are harder for me to think of. Perhaps something a few days before the new farmer joins the town. Pelican Town is such a little town; how do they feel about this new person invading? Or maybe a background fic of their life before the farmer came to town. Leah's story with her ex, how Shane's drinking habit really got started (and his love for chickens), why Abigail started eating rocks...

I'm not looking for a romantic or explicit sex story here. A general, quirky, mostly light-hearted fic would be fine. No darker subjects than what the game already gives. (I know Shane contemplates suicide in the game, but I really, really prefer that suicide or suicidal thoughts are NOT in the fic at all.) This is my happy, relaxing game, and I'd like the fic to be of a similar genre.

League of Legends RPF 

A bit of a warning, this is the fandom that I warned about (please read DYA for context), and it’s definitely my current addiction. If you are someone who is also interested in this fandom but have certain pairings/players you prefer, please know that I would actually love absolutely anything you could possibly throw at me. If you would like to know my preferences, I am partial to faker/bengi, pray/gorilla, and kuro/gorilla(/smeb), but I am a fervent multishipper and will happily read stories about any pairing or player. 

I'm also a huge fan of AUs (as stated above), so if you're not interested in trying to learn all the intricacies of the esports scene, that's fine with me! (If, by chance, you somehow know about League’s esports scene, I would be totally fine if you included other people from any teams, I am extremely flexible)

If you'd like more specific prompts, here are some (a ton):

1) faker &amp; deft actually went to the same high school, so an AU where they didn't go pro? Would they still have met and how would that have gone? Can be gen or shippy. (Can also include bang, because he also went to that high school and is actually one of deft's childhood friends.)

2) faker can be a huge troll in soloq (eg: alistar support for cpt jack), give me some crack or maybe a five times fic where he trolls people in game or irl

3) smeb is notoriously over-the-top no homo, but he’s really into cuddling kuro. Give me some good old fashioned gay panic?

4) pray &amp; gorilla are the undisputed parents of longzhu, and I adore the longzhu family dynamic, so anything to do with that would be ace. pray is the dad who pretends to not care but is the nicer one that cheers up his younger teammates while gorilla is the mom that cares too much and nags a ton. They have apparently perfected the carrot &amp; stick dynamic, and gorilla has deemed “prilla” to mean “duo for life.” If that’s not true love, I don’t know what is??

5) Give me anything ex-rox (smeb, peanut, kuro, pray, gorilla) and I will love you forever. Give me AU where they stayed together, give me a completely different AU (HP/superhero/whatever), give me random anecdotes from their time playing together, because they’re a family T____T

6) I have a soft spot for smeb/score, especially for their stupid shenanigans on KT. stories of them bullying deft or pawn as the crazy duo, how they bonded, anything goes

7) I love bengi, I love faker, and I really miss having them on the same team together (they were together for four years!!) Maybe something with 2016 all stars shenanigans (including smeb, pray, cpt jack, and madlife if you’d like) or an AU where bengi doesn’t leave (please <strike>don’t</strike> break my heart) or... retirement AU.

Faking It (TV 2014) 
Amy Raudenfeld

I just want Amy to be happy. Legitimately, that's all I ever wanted in this show, and even when the last few episodes were obviously rushed, it ended with a happy Amy and that's all I need.

I'm fine with any pairing for Amy (preferably f/f, but I'll take anything), just show me a happy future for her. I actually do like Amy/Sabrina, so if you're worried about it, don't be! If you don't want to write anything shippy, gen is also amazing in my book.

Some more specific prompts:

1) College AU, moving away from Hester and how does that change things?

2) I've always liked Amy &amp; Shane's dynamic, so anything about their friendship would be awesome. Shane cheering her up after Sabrina, going people-watching, silly hijinks to get to the bottom of Booper, the world is your oyster~

3) Future fic, where is everyone fifteen years from now? (Does Lauren fulfill everything in her fifteen year plan? What’s Amy up to/is she happy, in a relationship, ??)

4) How does Amy deal with the fact that Karma/Felix is probably going to become a thing? Two of her crushes getting together, lemme see that reaction

Honestly, anything dealing with Robo’s deadpan humor is excellent in my book, and yeah, I like Robo/Youzan, even with how incredibly little we have to work with because of how very little they’ve interacted so far :D;; 

Specific prompts:

1) Five times Robo was oblivious, and one time he figured out what someone was implying

2) Robo trying to understand proper human behavior/overanalyzing the way people act around each other/him, etc.

3) All tropes and AUs are accepted here, I know there isn’t very much canon to work with!

Edwin Drood, Helena Landless, John Jasper, Rosa Bud

Favorite pairings with these characters are Helena Landless/Rosa Bud and Edwin Drood/John Jasper, but feel free to write me gen or het. I am really open to anything you want to do with this wonderful unfinished novel. 

Personally, I have trouble thinking without some prompts, so if it's helpful:

Anything with Helena cross-dressing. Especially if the drag is really described in loving detail. Can be a gen fic or a pairing fic with Rosa. She can be dressing as a man for plot purposes or just playing the man for Rosa's pleasure/fun.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  <a title=\"
Jasper's opium dreams are about Edwin. Erotic, tender, romantic dreams and/or dark dreams of asphyxiating him with the infamous silk scarf. I love the idea of repetitive, obsessive, tormenting dreams.

I really enjoy the way Jasper fusses over Edwin and the fact that Edwin finds this a bit womanish but likes it. Anything exploring this.\">Roll mouse over \"link\" for popup text. Incest prompts behind cut, no need to view if this may upset you)</a>

David Copperfield - Charles Dickens 
David Copperfield (David Copperfield - Charles Dickens), Uriah Heep (David Copperfield - Charles Dickens)

So, I ship David Copperfield/Uriah Heep. I have written it, but don't feel your take on the pairing has to be mine. I am open to anything and everything with this pairing. I prefer happy endings, but if you want to give this pairing a try but feel happiness is not in the cards, by all means go with your instinct. I am into one-sided pining, as well as exploratory stuff and hate sex, with and without happy endings. I'd be interested in any time during their relationship and any degree of heat and kinkiness. I like epistolary fic and \"document\" fic. Uriah's awful adolescent poetry, rescued from the grate etc.

I will equally eagerly read gen interactions between David and Uriah so if you don't feel up to this unusual ship, don't worry at all. 

Prompts:

David says at one point: <i>\"I really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah or detested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood looking him in the face in the street.\" </i>   ....so what does David think he might like about him?

I'd be really interested in any kind of moment of kindness or understanding between them, set at any point, during or post-canon.
Bittersweet reconciliation in their old age would be lovely.

A Christmas-related story featuring both characters would very definitely appeal to me (I'm Jewish, but it's Dickens we're talking about)

Anything with Uriah jealously admiring David (his appearance, his goodness, his likability)

An post canon story where Uriah has become enormously rich and prosperous

Any kind of AU you can imagine

For the Term of His Natural Life - Marcus Clarke 
John Rex, Sarah Purfoy

Prompts/thoughts:

In general: John Rex is a no good weasel of a man and that's a fact. I don't mind hearing about this, but I would prefer for fic not to focus heavily on the ways in which his awfulness is physically killing him and making others unhappy.  For example, Sarah could be punishing him (I'd enjoy that) in any number of ways, sexual or non sexual, but I'd like a sense of fun with that.  

If you're not interested in going the pairing route, anything where Sarah shows her resourcefulness would be fun. Something about what she does after the novel ends.

I would LOVE porn for this pairing, anything and everything.

No real squicks or DNWs, but happy endings preferred. AUs of all kinds welcome. In Space seems particularly promising.
&nbsp;
<i>Sarah surveyed him with an expression of contempt. “Because your scheme has failed. Now this is mine. You have deserted me once; you will do so again in any other country. You are a murderer, a villain, and a coward, but you suit me. I save you, but I mean to keep you. I will bring you to Australia, where the first trooper will arrest you at my bidding as an escaped convict. If you don’t like to come, stay behind. I don’t care. I am rich. I have done no wrong. The law cannot touch me—Do you agree? Then tell the man to drive to Silver’s in Cornhill for your outfit.” </i>

HOT, God it's so hot. I feel cheated that John dies at this point. An AU where he lives and we go on from here would be especially amazing.

Duma Key - Stephen King 

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

For Elizabeth, canon gives us quite a lot already, but I'd love more about her art, her sisters and Noveen. Maybe something retrospective as she grows up, or her thoughts when Edgar arrives and she realises Perse's waking up again? She says she's not an artist any more, but has she ever felt the \"itch\" in the intervening years? Late in the book she tells Edgar, \"You will want to, but you mustn't\" - did she try to bring Melda back as well? What if it had worked, either as a 'came back wrong' thing or a bittersweet haunting? (An AU where Melda survived would also be very welcome.)

Likewise with Melda, I'd love anything from her POV. What struck me most when I was reading is how young she was when all this happened, and maybe not as able to act freely because of her position in the household, but she's still practical and decisive and instantly willing to believe Elizabeth. Had she heard about people dealing with something similar before, or even had supernatural encounters himself? King does love his childhood closet monsters. Maybe after Edgar has drowned Perse to sleep again, Melda and Elizabeth's ghosts can join forces to save a few of the souls on her ship!

And as for Perse, I just want any kind of exploration of her - her history and origins, her weird affinity with art, her shifting forms. Does she have any goal besides causing chaos? The ship is fascinating: is it a reflection of her, a prison for the people she takes, or even a literal ship that she's trying to crew so she can sail it somewhere? When she offers Edgar power, is that just a desperate lie, or has she had that kind of relationship with other artists in the past? If you're familiar with any of King's other work, it might be fun to try and fit her into his pantheon of evil gods - I feel like she and Rose Madder might be related.

I've read this story many times, and I always end up with more questions than answers - I think that's why I keep coming back to it! I love the feeling of mystery and murky things happening in the shadows, never fully revealed to the narrator or the reader. Mostly I'm fascinated by Gideon and I'd love anything from his POV. I could go for something set during his youth in his uncle's house, and all the horrifying occult things that might have happened there. It seems like his uncle is really pushing for Gideon to be a willing participant in whatever's going on, and I'm curious about that.

Later on, his motivations are really obscure. I'd love to see your interpretation of why he approached Peter to begin with, and what his intentions were. Was he really intending to feed him to the monster all along? Could he have been hoping for someone with a knowledge of the occult who could help him? Why do he and the Marquis both target booksellers - is it just that the library already exists as convenient bait, or is there some deeper reason?

This seems like a good moment to mention that I definitely ship Gideon/Peter, so I'd be more than delighted if you wanted to take things in that direction. Maybe Gideon started out with an ulterior motive, but Peter's line about hoping \"that he quite genuinely liked me and my company\" got me good, and I'd love to read something bittersweet about Gideon struggling with unintended feelings.

Fatal Frame III & V (Zero | Project Zero | Fatal Frame Series) 
Hinasaki Miu, Kozukata Yuuri, Kurosawa Hisoka, Kurosawa Rei

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

Looks like the games are going to be split up after this year, so I'll make the most of this while I can! I love Fatal Frame for the sad stories, the settings, and theme of the past and present being intertwined and connected, and also the way it slowly expands the world by bringing in new characters linked to the old ones. Out of the nominated characters I especially like Miu/Yuuri and Hisoka/Yuuri and would not be averse to Miu/Hisoka, but I'm a pretty easygoing multishipper and I also love gen and worldbuilding, so go where your heart tells you!

Some possible prompts:

- Rei helping Hisoka set up her own business and how she feels about Hisoka's interest in antique cameras...
- Hisoka helping Yuuri settle in at the shop after her suicide attempt, and getting used to having a stranger living there with her.
- After Yuuri's \"Embrace\" ending, Miu and Hisoka grieving for Yuuri and/or visiting her spirit on the mountain.
- After Yuuri's \"Bride from Black Water\" ending, Miu isn't really expecting Yuuri to come back at all. How does she react when she finds out she's still alive?
- Hisoka and Miu talk about their different experiences growing up with psychic abilities. I could see Hisoka wanting to mentor Miu and heal her a little, though it might be difficult to get over Miu's kneejerk mistrust.
- Miu wants to find out more about other Shadowborn and enlists help from one or all of the others.
- Rei and Yuuri meet and talk about coping mechanisms for when you have a strong emotional bond with the final boss.
- Rei finally gets to meet Miku's daughter! And their conflicted feelings about Miku and her disappearing acts.
- Any kind of time travel or roleswap where the characters end up back in the time of shrine maidens and sacrifices.

Pocket Mirror (Video Game) 

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

When I played this game I was so drawn to Harpae and Lisette and their twisted feelings towards Goldia. I'd love to see anything about that!

- Harpae/Goldia set after the \"Blindness\" ending. I love dark scenarios where one character imprisons another \"for their own good\".
- Lisette/Goldia: really anything exploring Lisette's conflicting feelings about Goldia, and her joint murderous/self-destructive impulses.
- Goldia tries to console one of Lisette's injured mirror-selves, even while it's trying to kill her.
- Harpae/Lisette: we know they're aware of each other, and we know Lisette at least can interact with the other personalities to some extent (crucifying Egliette, locking Fleta in the box). I'd love to see what happens if they meet. Maybe they encounter each other while they're waiting for Goldia to arrive?
- More surreal mindscapes, dreamquests and mirrorworlds. Maybe the unlockable \"secret room\" is not just a game feature. Maybe it's deeper than it looks.
- Look, hair-brushing is a cliche for a reason, okay?
- Something slightly less magical about Goldia post-canon, learning to integrate the different personalities into her concept of herself. There's a scene in the game where Lisette, Harpae and Fleta are sending Goldia glowing messages of hate/encouragement out of the darkness, and I feel like that could be a template for what her interaction with them will be like as she's recovering.
- Fairy-tale AU. Harpae as Goldia's devoted lady knight and Lisette as a banished witch, perhaps?

Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen | Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse 
Asou Misaki, Minazuki Ruka, Tsukimori Madoka

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

This game is A+ for interesting storylines and having a ritual/disaster take place in a more modern setting, but I do wish it had fleshed out the relationships more, especially when it comes to Ruka, Misaki and Madoka. So I turn to fic! I love the contrast of Ruka's poetic spaciness, Madoka's timidity, and Misaki's bossiness, and I'd love to see them interact with each other more. Once again, any combination of characters is fine, it doesn't have to include all three.

- Pre-canon! I could go for something fluffy, like maybe a beach episode, or Misaki and Madoka sneaking into a concert where Ruka is playing. Or something directly relating to canon - Misaki and Ruka researching Rougetsu Island together? Where were they when they heard that Marie and Tomoe were dead? Or maybe they all go ghost-hunting with Misaki's Camera Obscura!
- Missing scenes where Misaki and Ruka react to the fact that Madoka is dead. Just... anything other than the complete stone-faced lack of comment that we get in the game. :(
- Angsty Misaki/Madoka with (forgotten or subconscious) Misaki&gt;Sakuya, exploring that comment Madoka made about Misaki using her as a substitute.
- Less angsty Ruka/Madoka, or maybe something about Madoka listening to the messed-up song Ruka plays. Is there a connection between Madoka and the Tsukimori maidens?
- Threesome.
- GHOST threesome.
- If you really wanted to get into game lore, how about something with Misaki and Ruka exploring their ancestry? It feels like Kunihiko Asou and Souetsu Yomotsuki have some similarities - both wanted to find a way to reach the other world, and both seem to have died in the attempt. How do Misaki and Ruka feel about that, after what they've seen? (A friend of mine had a cool idea about dark!Ruka embracing the mask-making side of her family rather than the Tsukimori side, which appeals to my id in so many ways.)

경성학교: 사라진 소녀들 | The Silenced (2015) 
Hong Yeon-deok | Kazue (The Silenced), Cha Ju-ran | Shizuko (The Silenced)

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

This film immediately offered three of my favourite things - gorgeous visuals, creepy atmosphere, and f/f subtext - and sealed the deal by including a girl with superpowers wrecking everyone's shit. I'd love to read something shippy with these two, especially if they get a happy ending.

AUs where they both survive:

- Let's pretend Ju-ran wakes up just in time and they escape together! Ju-ran protecting Yeon-deok, fighting off more evil soldiers, huddling for warmth in derelict cottages... all the tropes you might expect from on-the-lam fic.
- Post-canon set a few years down the line, about them learning to live with Ju-ran's powers.
- Or you could go full Stephen King B-movie and have the monstrous results of other science experiments roaming the countryside. My mind is going to werewolves, for some reason...

Or if AUs aren't your jam:

- Something sweet in the afterlife-ish setting from the end of the movie.
- Post-canon fic where they're ghosts, and now the school really is haunted.
- Literally any cute missing scenes you can think of.

Мор. Утопия | Pathologic 
Daniel Dankovskiy, Artemiy Burakh

I ship these two with the fire of a thousand suns, but I'm also utterly fascinated by them in general as characters, so if you're more of a gen writer, that's a-okay by me. I'd prefer no AUs for this fandom as the world of Pathologic is just so dang fascinating in and of itself, though alternate timelines or post-game events are absolutely fine. Hurt/comfort, be it romantic or friendshippy, is great, and so is anything with these two just snarking at each other.

I'm squicked by non-con, mixed generation incest, bestiality, smut featuring underage characters, abuse of authority, and scat, none of which are too likely to show up with this pairing thankfully, but it's worth mentioning.

My weaknesses are hand kink, foot fetish, and necrophilia, though I don't need any of those to enjoy a fic.

Lethal Weapon (TV) 
Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV))

I've liked actor Clayne Crawford for years and was thrilled to see him get a lead in a major network show.  He infuses Riggs with a wonderful softness and an exquisitely painful depth of grief.  He manages to be a believable tragic figure, suffering the most extreme loss imaginable, yet also his wonderful comic self, bantering with Roger and Trish like a pro comedian with his easy wit.
I'd love to see Martin and Miranda during happier times, Martin finding new love with a canon character like Sarah or his ex-therapist Maureen, or even a future Martin having a baby and finally getting to hold his child in his arms.  I'd even take fix it fic where Miranda never is shot or they both survive and flourish as a family.  Roger and Trish are optional and only as needed to move the story forward.  It's okay to leave all the LA people out of it.  I just want to see Martin experience human emotions, preferably ending with joy.

So many wonderful characters - I can't choose just a couple!  I'd enjoy some Kirsten/Cameron where they finally have no more barriers to being truly intimate in all the ways that matter.  I'd love to see Camille and Linus give it another shot because they are awesome together.  I would really like to see fix it fic where Linus's father is never ill or gets out of the hospital fine.  Another dinner with the parents would be lovely, especially if it's with Camille and Linus as a real serious couple this time. I adore Fisher so even some Camille and Fisher friendship fic (boxing training?) would be fun. Future fic is okay as well, like if at some point Kirsten's mother is around and well enough to give her daughter away at her wedding or be there when she has a daughter of her own.  A big family wedding (Kirsteron or Camilnus) would make for a nice happy wrap up in case we don't get any more seasons.

Mushishi 
Ginko (Mushishi)

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Matoba and Ginko bonding over eye-loss. Ginko and the Medicine Seller exploring their mutual techniques in a way that goes poorly for everyone.)

Other than that, I'm just into this for the horror stories. I want Ginko to wander into danger, learn about cool mushi and solve a mystery. Make it as creepy and atmospheric as you can. I love creepy-pasta if you want to do something more modern. 

Types of horror I especially like: creeping unreality, body horror, the uncanny, humans-as-monstrous, psychological horror and isolation.
Types of horror I'm not a fan of: guro/gross-out, slasher

If you want to write pwp, feel free to write Ginko/Adashino or Ginko/mushi with Ginko getting overwhelmed.

I am a fan of haiku, renga, tanka and other Japanese poetry styles. If you too like these things, please feel free to incorporate such things.

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Nyanko vs The Medicine Seller? Adashino having connections with Taki's grandfather's collection? Natsume's issues with treating ayakashi/yokai as mushi/bugs? The Medicine Seller's methods give Matoba a headache. Tanuma seeking out Ginko or The Medicine Seller to find a way to see yokai and support Natsume more.)

I do ship Natsume and Tanuma, and I would love to have some slow, sweet realizations of their relationship-- possibly with youkai interference, or some mortal danger. I would love both a first date, where they end up having to hide from some youkai, OR Natsume or Tanuma in mortal danger and they discover their mutual feelings over the course of the rescue.

If you want to REALLY indulge me, Natsume and Tanuma both being forced to pretend to dress up as gods (think the Moon-Splitting Festival episode, with Natsume in the Houzukigami kimono and mask) and, you know, have sex in order to keep the forest from dying or something. That or a darker universe where Natsume has given up on humans entirely, and become the head of the Night Parade of 100 Demons or something and then meets Tanuma or Matoba.

I enjoy adventures with demons and the series itself with it's caring and warm atmosphere.

モノノ怪 | Mononoke (Anime & Manga) 

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Ginko's nonchalance in dealing with the wild confidence of The Medicine Seller. Or bringing the Medicine Seller into Natsume's modern setting and seeing how he adapts or doesn't adapt.)

The things I like best about this series are the theatrical pacing, the hallucinogenic atmosphere-- like, it feels almost like a fever dream with this sense of being unwell and also fascinated. The deep, unfolding psychological horror, and the way the series doesn't flinch from awful events, but shows how they can cause lasting trauma in a twisted, wild way that not controllable.

When it comes to the main character, I think the thing that fascinates me most is his wild confidence. He's so different and he owns his difference so no one ever questions him.

Types of horror I especially like: creeping unreality, body horror, the uncanny, humans-as-monstrous, psychological horror and isolation.
Types of horror I'm not a fan of: guro/gross-out, slasher

Pet Shop of Horrors 
Lau Wu-Fei \"Taizu\", Count D (Pet Shop of Horrors)

First off: This isn't exactly like the others, in that it's not being requested BECAUSE of the crossover potential. I don't mind a crossover-- I think Pet Shop of Horrors would make an amazing Mononoke episode, and Wu-fei getting caught up in a duel between the Medicine Seller and D, or otherwise dealing with that sort of headache would be great.

BUT, I just ship them, okay.

Maybe this is just my deep and abiding love for organized-crime-types, but I love the idea that Wu-Fei is trying so hard to run this criminal empire and things keep slipping through his fingers because D decided to move in. If you want to go with a coda from the manga, you could do something silly like him eating super-fertility eggs that D accidentally supplied a baker with and getting himself pregnant (I don't normally like mpreg, but I kind of love the idea of Wu-Fei just having to deal with something totally ricockulous because he keeps having to spend time with D). 

Or there's always another assassination attempt, or some other mafia-like plot. But with added ~magic~ craziness because D has a vested interest in keeping Wu-Fei alive.

I desperately ship Archie/Wolfe and would adore shipfic for the two of them, whether that be a first-time fic about how they fell in love/took the next step in their relationship, or an established relationship fic that focuses on a case but turns their flirting/affection up along the way. Wolfe coming to Archie's rescue - particularly when it puts him out/makes him go to trouble he'd never consider otherwise - is my jam, and I also like it the other way around as well. And yes, I would totally read Archie/Wolfe porn!

I'd also love to read about Inspector Cramer, Fritz, and/or Saul's perspective on Wolfe and Archie. I feel like Cramer might have some very interesting thoughts, particularly during a frustrating case, but that there's also a lot of grudging respect there. Do Wolfe &amp; Archie ever have to come to his rescue? Fritz has a front-row seat to the Archie/Wolfe show – does he realize they’re in love before they do? (The cook out-sleuthing the sleuths!) Or matchmake them? Same with Saul.

Motel (Fiddler on the Roof), Tzeitel (Fiddler on the Roof)

<i>Fiddler</i> is probably my favorite musical, and I love all its characters. Motel/Tzeitel are one of my favorite musical couples of all time. How did they fall in love? What were their feelings when they gave each other their pledge, despite the unlikelihood of that pledge being possible to carry out? What were they feeling during the confrontation with Tevye? How did Tzeitel feel seeing Motel stand up to Tevye? What was their first kiss like (and when did it happen)? What was Golde's reaction to Tevye's dream, and did it surprise Tzeitel? What was early married life like for them? What was Tzeitel's relationship with Chava like after Chava's marriage? (Either Motel is much more relaxed than Tevye on the ‘consorting with apostates’ front, or he knows better than to try to forbid Tzeitel to talk to her sister.)

I prefer fic set before/during the musical and immediately after, rather than futurefic set in America.

I love this book! It’s definitely my favorite of the Sally Lockhart series. The setting and the characters are both up my ally. I requested Adelaide because she's the only character I for sure need, but I like all of the other three nominated characters (Jim, Becky, and Karl), so please do include whichever of them you like too.

I ship Adelaide/Jim, Adelaide/Becky, and Jim/Karl, and would be interested in fic for any of those pairings. For this fandom I would prefer plot over porn, however, and friendship fic is also totally my groove if you’re not a shipper. What about an AU where Adelaide was able to stay Queen? (With Jim and/or Becky by her side.) How might she and her country have gone after that? Or how about an outside-POV, from Karl or some other Razkavian (Countess Thalgau would be awesome!), showing events and/or Adelaide from a Razkavian point of view? Or maybe a story about how the events of the novel turn into a national myth/legend (I like stories that have multiple perspectives/versions, including Rashomon-style, and it’d be neat to see that applied here). 

Canon-specific DNWs:
* Please no ‘healing-cock’ or comparison between Adelaide’s past as a sex worker and her experience having sex with Jim or Becky.
* Please no pre-canon fic, especially during Adelaide’s past as a sex worker.
* I’m not interested in characters from the broader Sally Lockhart series making an appearance.

Emperor's New Groove (2000) 
Kronk's Shoulder Devil, Kronk's Shoulder Angel, Kronk (Disney), Yzma (Disney)

This movie is the best. It never fails to make me smile. I asked for four characters and having them all in the same fic would be great, but it’s not required if a prompt takes you a different direction.

Kronk’s shoulder angel &amp; shoulder devil are hilarious. I’d love a story about them. Fights they have! Commentary between themselves while Kronk goes about his everyday life. Banter and flirtation and consummation. Do they ever leave Kronk, and how bereft is he? (How does he get them back?) Where do they go when they’re not on his shoulders? Do they ever end up getting twisted and advising Kronk backwards? Or maybe Kronk finds out that they’re most dangerous when they start agreeing. And how might they become lovers? (And how would Kronk react to that, haha?)

Yzma I don't ship with Kronk, but I'd love to see her perspective on any of the movie events, or a past/future adventure with her. Villain cat! I think she's my favorite Disney villain - she's amazing. Crossover in which she meets a different Disney villain (Ursula? Cruella? Lady Tremaine?) is totally welcome, whether she meets them in human or cat form. And I would totally ship Yzma with another female Disney villain. They could take over the world(s) together!!

I do ship Kronk/Kuzco and would love to see a story in which they fall in love. But friendship fic is totally cool too. Are there future threats to Kuzco's reign (probably from Yzma) that Kronk averts? Do they get turned into animals together? Does Kronk inadvertently (or on purpose) woo Kuzco with baked goods? Etc.

Queens of Crime RPF 
Agatha Christie (Queens of Crime RPF), Dorothy Sayers (Queens of Crime RPF), Margery Allingham (Queens of Crime RPF), Ngaio Marsh (Queens of Crime RPF)

I want the Queens of Crime to meet over lunch/tea and talk about crime writing! What do they think of each other’s heroines? Do they commiserate over the trials/tribulations of being a crime writer – the trickiness of alibis, the obstreperousness of sleuths, the tiring obligation to include romance subplots, the difficulty to find fresh new ways of committing murder, etc.? Do they teasingly point out plot holes/unbelievable elements in each other's books? (Or their own?) Maybe they talk about the novel they’d write, if they didn’t have to worry about selling copies. Or maybe they discuss what they’d do with each other’s sleuths. Or maybe they talk about crossovers – Harriet Vane and Agatha Troy becoming friends (or falling in love!), or Harriet and Ariadne Oliver, or Wimsey and Poirot. 

Basically, a gossipy tea-party with the Queens of Crime talking shop. :)

And if you ship any of them, I am also completely there for Queens of Crime falling in love! Do Agatha and Dorothy flirt with each other and miss the knowing looks Margery and Ngaio are exchanging? Is Margery’s hair askew because Dorothy kissed her when they were fetching the plates of sandwiches from the kitchen? The field is open.

Pet Shop of Horrors 
Leon Orcot, Count D (Pet Shop of Horrors)

Likes: D/Leon in all their weird awkward culture-clashing glory. Leon's journey from \"I'm going to arrest you\" to \"please take care of my baby brother while I'm at work, here's some candy to make up for it, but I'm still going to arrest you.\" All the surreal and gorgeous imagery in the shop. The vampire subplots. Chris's friendships with the pets, especially Honlon.

Specific prompts:

- What if D really was a vampire? When Leon makes that guess, does D confirm it in the moment, or does Leon find out some other way? Sexy biting scene a must.

- Word has gotten around that Leon is D's chosen mate, so various mythical personages, creatures, former pets, etc. start showing up to evaluate his worthiness and possibly put him through some tests. Naturally, nobody has explained what's going on to Leon.

- Show me some adventures with D adopting out crossover pets. Pokémon, magical Oz critters, Doctor Who/Futurama/Star Wars aliens, whatever. (If you write D into the backstory of Grumpy Cat, I will love you forever.) (Combination prompt with Fake News FPF: if you write \"Stephen\" as a pet that D adopts out to Jon, or vice versa, I will also love you forever.)

General likes:

    hurt/comfort

Home (2015) 
Oh )Home )2015)), Gratuity 'Tip Tucci (Home (2015))

Likes: Tip-Oh friendship. The way the Boov use random human objects in hilariously incorrect ways. Cool space exploration. Weird alien gender and biology things. Little shoutouts to book continuity.

Specific prompts:

- Futurefic with adult Tip being awesome at some alien-related profession. (Spaceship piloting? Interplanetary diplomat? Chasing down extraterrestrial fugitives?) Bonus points if you can work in a Lilo &amp; Stitch crossover.

- Something silly and entertaining about how the Boov interact with the human LGBTQ community. (I'm picturing Oh getting really worked up about needing different flags for all possible attraction combinations of the Seven Glorious Boov Genders.)

- If you've seen the Netflix show: I unreservedly love DieAnne, so any fic about her would be fantastic. Maybe she, Tip, and Oh have to team up for a mission. Either a serious world-saving one, or a ridiculously mundane one.

Fake News FPF 
Jon Stewart (Fake News FPF), \"Stephen Colbert\" (Fake News FPF)

Likes: Canon-typical humor. The magical surrealism of the Colbert Report universe. Hurt/comfort where \"Stephen\" goes through something horrible and Jon is there to support him. Role reversals where \"Stephen\" has to be the more put-together one in order to protect Jon.

Jon/\"Stephen\" is one of the OTPs of my heart. You can write pretty much anything with them -- fluffy, angsty, sweet, dysfunctional, canon-based, AU, whatever -- and I'll be thrilled.

Specific prompts:

- Jon/\"Stephen\" total setting AU. Fantasy, cyberpunk, Greek gods, Steven-Universe-style Gems...what does \"Stephen\" in this universe have Poorly-Informed But Firm and Unchangeable convictions about? And how does Jon fall in love in spite of himself?

- Something with \"Stephen\" interacting with Janice From Accounting, the unsung star of Last Week Tonight. It seems like she's the only person who could totally stymie him -- an immovable object to his unstoppable force.

- Sexy fluff with Jon and \"Stephen\" enjoying their retirement in a cabin in the woods, far away from the news. Kink appreciated. (Canon indicates that \"Stephen\" is a kinky sub with the safeword \"pumpkin patch,\" who likes bondage, costumes, collars, taking orders, praise, acting like a puppy, and that's just off the top of my head. At this point it should be established enough that they need minimal negotiation to have a good time.)

I love Kazuki and Soushi's fumble toward communication and understanding, how they negotiate identity and relationships under the ridiculous weight of their responsibilities. I'm especially preoccupied with those years of constant subliminal crossing between the first series and the film, and its aftermath; overwhelming reunion emotions, adjusting to different types of intimacy, settling into a new dynamic having come to terms with self-esteem issues, just everything about the undeniable resonance between them.

Perry Rhodan - Various Authors 
Gaumarol da Bostich | Bostich I. (Perry Rhodan Books)

The Arkonides have been my favourites since the beginning, and I’m particularly interested in Arkonide culture, tensions within the Imperium, and Terran/Arkonide interactions and clashes (different points of view and value systems colliding, military interests ...). Bostich exemplifies all of that, with his journey from unexceptional bureaucrat to puppet Imperator to actually seizing power, and then from expansionist imperialism to grudging cooperation under duress to genuine commitment to the Galaktikum.
Suggestions: Bostich &amp; Atlan, the unseen reconciliation. Bostich &amp; Aktakul, an unexpected friendship. Bostich &amp; Jasmyne, former lovers. Bostich &amp; Tifflor, enemies and allies. Bostich &amp; Bull, what Bostich had done to Bull. Bostich &amp; Rhodan, their deal with the devil. Bostich as leader of the Galaktikum, with many of his former enemies now working for him. Bostich and his own changing views and changing role in the galaxy.
Shipping: Bostich/Jasmyne, Bostich/Aktakul or Bostich/Tifflor
I don’t mind if you’d rather write in German.

Charlotte Holmes Series - Brittany Cavallaro 
August Moriarty

I like the idea of a world where the Holmes, Watson and Moriarty families are huge sprawling messes of expectation and cultural heritage, the way the characters born into those families are forced to navigate those expectations. The Moriartys interest me particularly because we know a lot less about them than the Holmeses or Watsons. August in particular embodies a lot of that struggle, the only one visibly trying to get away from the family business and attempting to escape that “destiny” by acting counter to expectation. 
Suggestions: August &amp; Charlotte and their fraught history. August &amp;  Milo working together, with all their trust issues. August &amp; Leander and that offer at the end of <i>The Last of August</i>. August initially deciding to go into hiding, and what it costs him. August surviving the end of LoA (faking his death?).

Old Surehand (Karl May Verlag) – Karl May 
Tehua | Tahua | Emily Bender | Kolma Puschi

I’ve been a Karl May fan since I was a kid, and Kolma Puschi is one of the most fascinating figures of the books. We meet her as a mystery and a legend, passing as a male warrior, but her backstory is what makes all of that so interesting. A preacher’s sister; a Native woman who married a white man; a falsely convicted forger and prison inmate; a mother searching for her sons; an avenger on the track of her brother’s murderer; a stoic warrior legend – somehow she integrates all of these identities. 
Suggestions: Tehua becoming Kolma Puschi, making a reputation for herself. Her thoughts on her position as a warrior and a woman, and on posing as a man. Using her ability to code-switch to solve a problem. Tehua &amp; Tusahga Saritsch, who knows her real identity. Backstory - Tehua in the East, searching for Etters, or in her youth, meeting a young Winnetou and/or Nscho-tschi. 
No shipping, please, except for Tehua’s marriage to Bender. 
Please don’t use the “Kolma Putschi” spelling for her name, I genuinely dislike it.

16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds (Video Game) 
Lucy (16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds)

I would enjoy both light-hearted fun takes on vampire hunting or something dark and frightening and terrible. I came out of this game wanting a billion stories about queer vampire hunting girls, and ship Lucy (the delightful, smart, creative protagonist) with both Maggie (one of the people who hunt vampires with Lucy, best described in the game as: Maggie looks like Tinkerbell. Five feet tall with short blonde hair and a wide smile. The effect is only slightly ruined by the machete and the spray of blood decorating her face and tank top) and Claire (the adorable cashier).

I love Cassie and her story so much; she goes from reluctantly helping her mother to being terrified of the thing in the basement, to being protective and smart and loyal. Her mother is also great, and the rest of the librarians who show up in the last part absolutely delightful.

The thing in the basement is giant and spider-like, which means my DNW sort of doesn’t apply here (and also, I have no idea why I love this story so much, because normally I would have noped out of this the second I figured it out). It is also, somehow, a delight.

United States of Asgard - Tessa Gratton 
Soren Bearstar, Glory | Fenris Wolf, Astrid Glyn, Amon Thorson

Dot Hutchison once described the three books in an absolutely perfect way: If Soren’s journey was about accepting himself, and Signy’s about anchoring herself, then Astrid’s journey is about making herself.

I love the world Gratton built. I love the ways the gods are and are not involved with the human world, I love how they can and can’t be trusted, all at the same time, I love the details of how the world has changed because the gods are real and active and what that means for the USA. (One thing I hate is the treatment of the Native American tribes and [lack of] characters; though there are a handful of references to what happened when the Norse gods and their followers came over, mostly they are erased from the narrative, with the exception of Soren’s Pacific Islander ancestry.)

Mostly, though, I love the characters. They are young and strong and weak and fierce, afraid and brave and driven, loved and loving, and, always, hungry to make the world better in whatever way that means to them. I love all of these characters, and would love to see their adventures, together and apart.

Les Misérables (Dallas 2014) 
Javert (Dallas 2014), Jean Valjean (Dallas 2014)

I absolutely love how this production modernizes the show – we might still have the same libretto, but many of the staging choices are so striking and always make me incredibly curious about the world we get to see. What sort of country is this – is it France? Is it the US? Is it contemporary, or is it a dystopian future? How did the different experiences these characters made shape their personalities compared to the 1830s France characters? (For example, a Valjean who spent most of his life in the US prison system instead of the19th century bagne of Toulon!)

What I always find most intriguing about Dallas fic is seeing how a writer makes the characters and the world their own, and comes up with character voices, so whether you want to write a contemporary Texas, a dystopian France, or you find a completely different interpretation of this world, I'm up for all of these things!

Kamen Rider Decade 
Onodera Yuusuke (Kamen Rider Decade), Kadoya Tsukasa (Kamen Rider Decade), Hikari Natsumi (Kamen Rider Decade), Kaitou Daiki (Kamen Rider Decade)

I'd love anything involving these four continuing to bounce around the multiverse.  Feel free to do a crossover with anything--with a later Sentai or Kamen Rider show, to pull in continuity from a movie, to throw them into any other random world (or into other toku worlds--how does the world of Ultraman or Garo handle these four?).  I ship the foursome hard, but I would be happy with anything that just has them continuing to be a strange little family that's sometimes dysfunctional but still works to keep everyone as happy as possible.  Hurt/comfort is great.  Digging into emotions is great.  My only real do not wants are rape or non-con where the focus is on the violation rather than on the healing.

Kamen Rider Kuuga 
Godai Yuusuke, Ichijou Kaoru

I really, really love everyone in Kuuga, but this pair owns my heart.  I ship them, though I also love an asexual Ichijou.  Feel free to pull in any supporting cast members, though--one of the things I adore about Kuuga is how everyone tries to support everyone.  Feel free to set it mid-series or post-series.  I love seeing Godai having alien biology from the Kuuga belt explored.  I love seeing how Godai and Ichijou manage their rather different lives--Ichijou isn't going to give up the cop life until he can't do it, and Godai needs to travel, especially post-series.  Godai taking Ichijou on a vacation is something I love, and feel free to have the location be somewhere crazy.  Hurt/comfort is always good.  Just give me these two being themselves and having different needs but being very supportive of each other and managing to meld their lives anyway, because one of the things they need post the Grongi War is each other.

I adore seeing people come up with alien cultures for the crew and watching them meld and butt against each other.  Marvelous being a brilliant, insane, charismatic leader who protects his crew and understands them better than others expect makes me ecstatic.  Show me the crew chasing another treasure.  Go crazy with a crossover with a later sentai, or with another franchise entirely (a crossover with the Kyurangers would be fascinating).

I absolutely adored this threesome and their pirate life.  In a series full of so much pain it was beautiful to see some healing and love, and to have a canonical happy threesome.  I would love either a little snippet set in the time that they were happy (the time so beautifully glossed over in that single sentence at the start of the chapter), or an AU where Innon doesn't die.  Innon and his death had such an impact on both Alabaster and Essun, how would him managing to survive (and how *would* he survive) change things?

I just want to see Garu supporting and protecting Lucky, and Lucky recognizing how important he is to Garu.  Hurt/comfort is great.  Garu reacting to Lucky almost dying is great.  The two of them trying to navigate a universe that isn't apocalyptic, either in an imagined post-series or because they end up shunted between universes, is great.  I adore the rest of the team, too, so feel free to include anyone you want.

I'd basically like more of what the movies offered, though perhaps with an explicit Abe no Seimei/Hiromasa pairing.  I love the period setting, the magic and mystery.  I love anything that plays with Seimei being half-kitsune and what that gives him/how that's impacted his life beyond him being a damn strong onmyouji.  I love seeing Hiromasa being his wonderful self, not wanting to see anyone hurt, while still being very much a product of his time period.  I really like the idea of the two of them in a relationship, and given the period it would probably be an It's Complicated relationship with Hiromasa still courting ladies of the court (unless Seimei would have objections).  Another threat to the capital/the nation being defeated; the aftermath of their next battle as protectors; the two of them just having tea and it getting weird because Seimei's life and household is weird; basically anything with these two would be great.  Hurt/comfort is always beautiful (the moment in the first movie when Seimei thinks Hiromasa is gone forever; the moment in the second when Hiromasa is watching over a comatose Seimei).

Incest, dubcon, worldbuilding (non-explicit) A/B/O and crossovers okay, but see letter for details. Please avoid people dying from terminal diseases except for one fandom. Likes: Fluff (family/friend/team bonding), hurt/comfort. 

For the nominated characters, I'm open to pairing the Player Character with Damien or Grace, and Damien with Grace. Conflicted one-sided Odin/Player Character is fine as well. For non-nominated characters, I tend to ship the Player Character with Yuelia and Zippy with Chic (we know that Chic wouldn't mind dating Zippy, after all), so if you want to put those in as background pairings, that's fine. I headcanon my (female) Player Character as bisexual or asexual/biromantic (or asexual polyromantic), but I am not you; you feel free to do what you want romance-wise!

Note that not all characters have to appear in the fic.

Prompts:
* There's a whole lot of worldbuilding that I'd to see, but here are some ideas:
- What is the scientific community like? Does it have any intersection with the Alchemist Life?
- Is there a library that we don't see in Porto Puerto? How about some discussion between the library branches? (It's fine to include Origin Island in this as well.)
* Damien and Grace - I know that neither Damien nor Grace are really keen on marriage to each other, but what if they don't really have a choice?
* Ditto for Damien and the Player Character - I've written this before but it would be cool to see what would happen if the Player Character turns out to be a viable choice (much to Demona's dismay, and probably the Player Character's). This also would be part worldbuilding because all we know about the qualifications for Damien's bride is from Demona's questioning of Grace in the DLC.
* Damien and Odin discuss things after his Trial, given what happened during it.

ファイナルファンタジーＸＩＶ 光のお父さん | Final Fantasy XIV: Dad of Light 
Shoda Yoko, Inaba Hirotaro, Inaba Aiko

Shipping-wise, I do ship Aiko/Yoko, even if Aiko is a tad oblivious.  I also have not played Final Fantasy XIV (my MMO of choice is Guild Wars 2), but feel free to include game details if you do play it.

As with all my fandoms, not all characters have to appear in the fic.

Prompts:
* Hirotaro learning to MMO. We see some of it (mostly when Aiko is trying to help his father), but I'd like to see Hirotaro learn the game.
* Perhaps a little more of the flashback where young Aiko is teaching his father how to play Final Fantasy III. (I thought it was the original Final Fantasy, but apparently it's an early III.)
* Aiko finally realizing that Yoko wants to go on a date.
* Yoko agonizing about quitting and the uniform issue.

Kamen Rider Drive 
Shijima Kiriko, Saijou Kyuu

I ship Kiriko/Chase, but I don't think that this really comes up in my prompts and I don't mind Chase being a younger \"brother\" of sorts to the Shijima siblings. (Speaking of siblings, I'm not really fond of Gou but I'm okay as long as he's not the focus character.)

Prompts:
* What would it have been like if Kiriko became Drive? What would have changed?
* Kiriko bonds with her Special Investigation Unit coworkers.
* Maybe-happier AU where Kiriko suddenly has 108 (or 109) \"younger\" robot siblings.
* Kyuu and 072, a happier ending.
* Kyuu goes to a convention, possibly in the U.S. Possibly he's a Guest of Honor!
* That scene where Kyuu and 072 become friends - I'd love to see an expanded version of it.

Kamen Rider Ex-Aid 
Houjou Emu, Poppy Pipopapo, Parad (Kamen Rider Ex-Aid)

Shipping: I ship Emu/Parad. 

Exception to the DNWs: I'm actually okay with a terminal Game Illness (at least with the person becoming a Bugster).

Prompts:
* I'm really interested in Parad's relationship with Emu post-series, either romantically or as a brotherly relationship.
* Poppy tries to take care of Emu when he's down.
* Parad and/or Poppy get Dan Kuroto to design yet another Gashat - what would be the likely outcome? (Another Survival Horror like Fatal Frame, perhaps? A visual novel like one of the Zero Escape games? Or maybe a MMO like Guild Wars 2 or Glitch....)

Rune Factory 4 
Frey (Rune Factory), Vishnal (Rune Factory), Ventuswill (Rune Factory), Blossom (Rune Factory)

I ship the crackship of Frey/Blossom (and I wouldn't mind Frey/Dolce), but in-game I usually end up romancing Vishnal, Kiel, or Leon. (I also adore Dylas and Doug's very interesting friendship.)

Prompts:
* Ventuswill worries about Frey, and tries to provide some comfort to her.
* The Dragon and the Princess: The Great Prank War.
* Frey might not truly be a princess, but to Vishnal, that's always what she will be to him.
* Frey tries to romance an oblivious (or not so oblivious) Blossom. This could involve time travel. And a very confused Ventuswill.
* Vishnal finds himself in friendly competition with Blossom.

Stardew Valley (Video Game) 
Female Player (Stardew Valley), Penny (Stardew Valley), Maru (Stardew Valley)

I like Stardew Valley because you can focus on what you want - whether it's to explore the mines, work on your relationships, tend your farm, or anything else. I tend to be a miner myself, but I see all the pretty farms and I'm jealous. Being able to romance or just befriend a lot of people is great, and I enjoy the challenge of not letting the relationships decay too much (or at least until I reach the point where I no longer have to do it). I love everybody in Pelican Town (I've even gotten used to Pam and Jasmine) and part of what I focus on is making the town better for everyone.

Note: I specified (cis)female farmer because that's what I play, but I'm fine with a genderqueer/agender farmer or a transgender one. I usually romance Maru, but I'm also fine with Shane, Haley, or Abagail if you prefer.

Prompts:
* The farmer and Penny - discussing educational methods, books, and family on a cold winter day.
* MarILDA comes back for a visit.
* Penny and Maru end up romancing each other, and the farmer has an idea - why don't they move onto the farm, and the farmer will move in with Maru's family.
* Taking care of one of the specialty farms - how does the farmer go about it?
* Maru and her parents have a talk after the farmer starts romancing Maru.

Also, all of the requested characters do not have to be included in the fic.

I love the mood of the album and the videos - the freedom hunting and self-indulgent thrill-seeking, the rebellion against how the world works, finding a new kind of home and way of living, the whole extremely nonsensical dystopia with tight-knit gangs of misfits in fab outfits racing away from really weird police on fancy vehicles as they wail about saving each other: HELL YEAH.

Thirsty - M. T. Anderson 
Chris (Thirsty)

Asking for a happy ending to get wrangled out of this book feels like rather a betrayal of its spirit, but, just, poor Chris! He was not equipped to deal with the kind of decisions he got saddled with. If this goes really dark before it gets better, that's fine - maybe he just can't quell that vampiric thirst anymore, even before he gets out of his house or neighbourhood - but I would really would love a happier ending for him. Maybe some other power can get use out of a proto-vampire on the cusp of sealing the deal, and offers him self-control in exchange for blood. Maybe some other, more terrifying angels can help after all.

I'd also love anything more about the details of this urban fantasy life he loves, even if it doesn't touch on the main plot of the book - the portrayal was really interesting. That one story mentioned where a woman put her babies in the fire on the suspicion that there was a changeling - but only one turned out to be a changeling, and the other one was a normal human - still sticks in my mind. Maybe something about other changelings? Or about how the supernatural elements work in other countries - how bound they are to localities, or if they grow markedly different if they manage to travel.

It was darkly humorous how the book played up the standard changes of growing up into something epic, life-and-death, due to the interplay of normal life and the supernatural. More of that would be great, like the changes of puberty alongside monstrous bodily changes, or something with an older Chris struggling with a supernatural debt as his peers struggle with college debt.

Or they could run into more difficulties making people believe what was happening. Or, when the Armitages' deaths are being investigated, details about the truth come out - and people try to save the victims, but other people try to emulate it...

Like Real People Do - Hozier (Song) 
Honey (Like Real People Do), Narrator (Like Real People Do)

Sweet &amp; creepy is one of my fave atmospheres, so bringing that aspect of the song out in fic form would be wonderful. I want anything on Revenant Would-Be Lover, putting thoughts and memories and something like a life back together, and their tentative but persistent affection for Honey. Honey doesn't have to have romantic feelings for them, but I'd prefer Revenant to stay more on the sweet side and less on the creepy in the case of unrequited love.

Any genders are OK. And uh, you don't have to call the narrator \"Revenant\" or the other person \"Honey\", I'm doing that for convenience. The Barn on the Farm version of the song has ruined me slightly and has got me tending to imagine this story playing out in a rural setting. If there's any sex, please make Revenant not be a grody type zombie with bits falling off, though unsettling physiology is okay. For both of them, even, depending on what you decide to do with Honey.

I wound up writing Pop Girl last year which made me like her a little more, actually. So I wonder what would happen if Cassie and Nick run across her again. I'm not a huge Kira fan, because she seemed too apathetic and empty in the movie, but if she shows up in the story I hope you can sell her to me. I wanted to like her, I just kinda... didn't. Cassie and Nick get on like a house on fire, and I ship it with an aged up Cassie if your muse takes you there.

Monster High 
Draculaura (Monster High)

Draculaura has always been my favorite character in Monster High - both old and new versions.  Her sweet, kind nature appeals to me.  I'm really loving the reboot Draculaura, and would love to see something with her and her father, either from before they met Frankie in new continuity, or trying to find time for family bonding while dealing with the growing pressures of running a school and finding new students.  Any other characters added to the mix would be fine, but family bonding is what I want above all else - Fangelica and Elissabat count as family for these purposes.

It would also be cool to see an older Elizabeth cross over with the 2013 series somehow - crossing paths with Jedikiah post that series or helping Stephen's group somehow.

I think a post-series encounter would be especially interesting, given John's mental state at the end of the series.

Illyana's story is so tragic and layered, and I love her to death.  Anything Illyana-centric would be awesome.  With her character being what it is, darkfic would be appropriate (though nothing super-gory or non-con).  Illyana was also kind of flirty in her New Mutants days, so her deciding to mess with her teammates or the Hellions with wicked flirting would be cool, but nothing further than kissing - she's, what, fourteen or fifteen-ish?  Marvel time is weird.
Illyana wrestling with her Darkchilde self, talking with her teammates about deep philosophical issues, pranking people, teasing her brother, dealing with the aftermath of Fall of the Mutants, you name it.  Anything pre-Inferno would be sweet.  I love the varied relationships she has with everyone, especially Dani, Rahne, and Doug.  And Illyana and Kitty are the best of friends (with subtext?)  Ooh, crushes - requited or otherwise, would be cool too.  I've always seen her as pansexual, so crushes/flirting with anyone would work for me.
Really, if she sounds like Illyana and acts like Illyana as Claremont &amp; Simonson wrote her, it will make me super happy

New Dangan Ronpa V3: Everyone's New Semester of Killing

Do not wants: Permanent death of requested characters, pregnancy, harm to animals, modern/mundane AU, sad ending

&nbsp;

Even though I have 'mundane AU' in my DNWs, setting the story in the Hope's Peak bonus mode is fine!

Please note that it's not necessary to include all four characters! I just like all four so much, that I couldn't chose! Out of this group, I ship Amami/Kaede, Amami/Kaede/Saihara, and Ouma/Saihara! I'd prefer not to receive Saihara/Kaede unless it's part of poly with Amami. I'd also prefer no Ouma/Amami, unless there's end-game Oumasai (I do feel as if Ouma was kind of into Amami too, even if Oumasai is my main Ouma ship!).

Prompts for all characters:
-Fix-its!
-Something set pre-canon. Amami and Kaede or Saihara and Ouma having known each other pre-killing game would be great to play with
-AU with different survivors at the end (I'd love to see Amami using his SHSL Survivor talents in the outside world post-game, especially)
-SDR2 AU, where instead of Saishuu, the v3 kids find themselves on Jabberwock Island
-Future Arc AU. What would everyone's NG Codes be? (I *loved* the NG Codes aspect)
-Anything involving the Love Hotel, even if you feel like it's been done before. I am Weak and easy to please.

Ouma/Saihara-
-Persona 5 AU
-Saihara seeing through a lie
-Ouma telling a lie to protect Saihara from something
-Either of them remembers their life pre-canon, where they knew each other. How would this change things?
-AU where Ouma lives. I'd love to see the two rebuilding together.

Amami/Kaede(/Saihara)-
-Amami winds up with the love hotel key and visits Kaede's fantasy, or intrudes on her fantasy while Saihara is already there?
-AU where Kaede remains the protag (if you need to chose a different first victim and killer, any character I haven't requested is fine!)
-Kaede's super hearing allowing her to hear odd sounds coming from Amami's room. What could he be doing in there~?
-Piano sex

It's not necessary to use all four characters! I just enjoy them all equally and couldn't pick between them! As for ships, I love Berkut/Rinea, and Forsyth/Python! I'm not big on Alm/Celica, though, so I prefer mentions of it kept brief.

Prompts for all:
-Magical mishap/spell gone wrong (feel free to go either funny and fluffy, or darker here)
-Battlefield injury, with hurt/comfort after
-'Magic made them do it'

Python/Forsyth
-Overnight supply run
-Battlefield injury, with possible hurt/comfort after
-Python comes off as kind of depressed to me, rather than just simply lazy. I’d love to see exploration of that.

Berkut/Rinea
-Berkut’s feelings about Rinea. I feel that despite what transpired, he really did love her. I’d love to see more on his feelings.
-The same for Rinea! What are her feelings on her lord? She loves him, of course, but she must feel conflicted as well, given some (most) of his behavior.
-AU where the both of them team up with Alm, or even maybe Celica?
-Fix-it! I live for post-canon fix-its.

Once again, I chose multiple characters because I love them all equally! That said, no need to include all three boys unless you want to! My ships are Watson/Friday, Watson/Nikolai, or Watson/Nikolai/Friday.

-Watson revives both Friday and Nikolai. What happens next?
-A Nikolai-centric fix-it
-A missing scene between any of these boys during their journey (as much as I love living!Friday, zombie!Friday was adorable)
-More steampunk world-building
-Friday and/or Nikolai is brought back, but has difficulties with feeling 'human enough'/struggles with zombie urges, etc

Code: Realize 
Cardia Beckford, Victor Frankenstein (Code: Realize)

Do not wants: Permanent character death, pregnancy, harm to animals, modern/mundane AU, sad ending

I'm mostly interesting in the time when they were all staying in the mansion together, and Fran was acting as her doctor. I love medical themes, so any scene you want to write for me of him attempting to examine her, any angst over his not knowing how to cure her condition, not being able to touch one another, complications with Cardia attempting to function before having special things made that she could touch (Fran feeling bad/weird about how she has to eat before having cutlery she could actually put in her mouth, etc) would all be great!

Southland 
Ben Sherman, John Cooper (Southland)

Anything with these two hooking up would make me so happy.

Would like it if things start out very spiky and conflictual and then resolve into a happy ending. Lengthy tormented pining on either side is also great. Porn is great but not compulsory.

If you are not feeling the romance/sex aspect (or if you just like case fic), case fic would also be cool.

Would prefer the issues/complexities with professional boundaries and power imbalance to be part of the story rather than handwaved away- the conflict and taboo around this are very hot/tasty to me! 

No character death please, cannot cope with the series ending AT ALL (in fact a fixit would be great).

The Night Manager (TV) 
Jonathan Pine, Lance \"Corky\" Corkoran, Richard Roper

There is a high stakes, intricate psychological chess game going on between these three during the events of canon, and I would love it if the implicit sexual tension in it became more overt.

For instance...
Does Jonathan try to seduce Corky to get him on side? This could be: he just ambiguously flirts with him, or he actually bangs him. BONUS excitement if Jonathan has never banged a man before and doesn't think he'll like it, but then does. The spectre of Roper looms over it all - they continue to manoeuvre to gain his confidence. I'm not sure if Roper should know they're hooking up - whatever gives the best conflict!

OR: have Roper and Corky always hooked up casually on the downlow? Now Roper makes it known he expects Jonathan to join this arrangement as a show of trust (or just because he believes J will be into it). Jonathan feels he must comply to keep them on side.

These ideas are pretty dubcon-ish because I am really into the danger and ambiguity here, but if that is not your comfort zone, things could all remain on the level of the psychological rather than physical.

Ok to not use all listed characters, if you like.

Myst Series 

Having recently visited a few caverns irl, I am struck by a feeling of longing for the capital-letter-Cavern, its heavy voids and silences. Any of these four characters, alone or in bundle, had the chance to wander down after the Fall and experience some kind of reflection or adventure. I am equally interested in the more rational kind of plots that are normally associated with Myst-era characters and in the thrill of the unexplainable that comes with Uru territory, and in mixing it up. Any of these characters could walk into some meaningful building with some history that resonates with them, meet a bahro or twenty-five, follow the mysterious rowboat that can be spotted in the farthest waters of the lake, hear a ghost story...
If you have cool visuals or worldbuilding in mind for an Age, go wild. But when it comes to canon settings, this year I am mostly interested in D'ni and the tunnels and the desert above.
Jeff could be meeting Yeesha for the first time, and/or first following his father and his DRF pals to the City, coming to terms with the Call... if you feel like writing DRF people, I certainly feel like reading them. Jeff cautiously spending time with Yeesha, whom he likes to think of as a friend but is as skittish as the roadrunner painted on her chest. Roasting marshmallows around a bonfire? On a road trip for the sake of it? Jeff observing the first explorers, or following his father's footsteps and trying to come to terms with his death?
Atrus could be searching for Yeesha a few years after she left them and find... something else instead. He could link to D'ni incognito a couple of years after End of Ages and see the Cavern lit up anew, breathing with new life and speaking with new voices. Maybe Yeesha could accompany him (although, good luck with the incognito part in that case). Before writing Releeshahn, he could reflect on some meaningful bit of D'ni history, maybe along with Catherine or Marrim. He could explore the desert before building Tomahna. He could probably see a stalagmite grow faster than D'ni did in between failed attempts at a restoration. He could find beauty in many things and be kind and avoidant to many creatures.
Calam solo fic would probably be the best fit for a spooky story in the Cavern... or what did this master writer Write after the Fall?
Yeesha simply yeesha-ing around makes for great fic. Did she first see D'ni as a child, with her parents? Maybe she felt something so clearly and then struggled to find it again when she started her journey as a teenager. Maybe she finds Catherine's journals long before the DRF do and reads something about her parents' past, maybe she somehow feels a connection with Catherine after her death. Slice of life fic where she sometimes drops by to care for an aging Atrus on Releeshahn and allow herself to be his daughter is always welcome... any plot that gives her something nice for a change, some positive connection.

DNW: non-canon ships, character bashing (just to play it safe with Yeesha. I like to see her flaws explored but I like her!)

Twin Peaks 
Tamara \"Tammy\" Preston

She didn't get to do much on her own in the show, which only makes me want to read a hundred fic about her... away from the intimidating aura of her two mentors (being the teacher's pet can be stressful!) and of Diane “told me to go fuck myself and I was thankful, 10/10 would be insulted again” Evans, would she still be kinda introverted and so very awkward, or would her nerdiness shine like it does in her written notes in The Secret History? Or would it be a blend where she speaks up more... and regularly infodumps like a champ? After all, her diligence and awkwardness in the show go along well with her geeky side in the book. I know some people feel that they're two very different portrayals but I enjoy them both and I think they dovetail pretty neatly to boot, as it's not unusual for someone who's not the best at social cues to be more open in writing. Chrysta Bell said that one thing she has in common with her character is that they both feel the need to be thoroughly prepared for an upcoming situation and that's an interesting trait too.
In general, I don't have any strong preferences for Tammy ships, I just want her with a girl and for the fic to make me get why she likes the other girl and why the other girl likes her. If you're into any option in the tagset, barring Blackie, Denise, Diane and Doris because the age difference would be excessive for me, and adding Shelly and Donna to round it up, go for it, I'm eager to be convinced!
Starting with the more out there prompts, there was an interview where CB was asked whether she felt that Tammy was “the new Cooper” and she said no but Tammy is trying her best!!! And that Coop is more open to the unknown, and Tammy is only just starting. As I think that Cooper's failures are a big part of the narrative, I'm not sure anyone should aspire to be the new Cooper, but anyway, I've been wondering about these two characters interacting (in dreams?) ever since. Reaching out to her as the new Blue Rose agent and/or as someone who is just starting to peek 'between two worlds', warning her, teaching her, getting to know her and even seeing shades of Albert and Gordon in her. And what would she think of him? And maybe Laura is with him, or maybe it's just Laura and Tammy, secrets whispered to her ear, a world just for them. Maybe Laura could be a better teacher. She knows the darkness. Or maybe she would be too intense. Or maybe she got ripped out of the timeline thanks to sOMEONE and still hasn't fully found herself again so Tammy would meet Carrie instead, how'd that go?
I have also been thinking about a Tumblr post (linked in letter) about Tammy being the one to find Audrey and how cool it would be see Tammy go through shifted realities, and how she would relate to Audrey, and Audrey to her. I don't know if The Final Dossier will tell us anything about how the rest of the town perceives Audrey's absence, but Tammy could find a clue and start a little investigation of her own?
Cynthia could be a fun partner for supernatural casefic. She's the Air Force side of Blue Rose to Tammy's FBI, like Milford and Gordon in The Secret History, and later Garland and Cooper... we don't know much about her but I love her attitude, I think they'd be a formidable team. ...or they could simply go out one night in Buckhorn before Cynthia flies back. And find a ghost or something.
The lack of scenes with just Tammy and Diane is one of my biggest regrets. I was expecting some follow-up to the “fuck you, Tammy” scene, maybe with Tammy a little starstruck and Diane seeing both herself and Coop in this young, naive agent and... trying to open her eyes. Or just them talking about cats, and/or Tammy is surprisingly proficient at mixing a Cosmopolitan, and/or something spooky and surreal happens while they're having breakfast.
Albert and Denise are her mentors – we see Albert mother-henning her all the time and Denise seems very protective of Tammy specifically, and I eat up platonic mentor-pupil dynamics with a spoon. Any adventures with either of them? If we swap out Gordon for Denise, what's Tammy's average day with FBI dad and FBI mom (but no shipping them, please) instead of FBI dad and FBI grandpa?
Or if you can think of any plot that would involve Tammy and Constance, Candie, Jade or Darya, go for it instead.

DNW: Dale/Audrey on Coop's part (whereas Audrey fondly remembering her teen crush on Coop, like the stuff Richard mentions, is okay)

Europe After the Rain II - Max Ernst (Painting) 

Biggest version I could find online: https://www.artsy.net/artwork/max-ernst-europe-after-the-rain#!
Nominating De Chirico and Magritte has been a winning move these past two Yuletides, so, without further ado, onto my third fave... the aspect of his work I love the most is basically landscapes – among those, I picked one that was a little more narrative, with more potential background to explore, and clearly 'post-apocalyptic surrealism' are two great tastes that go great together.
This painting feels like grief etched into moss-covered stone. What kind of war is called a rain, or are the war that ravaged this land and the rain in the title two separate things, and what is growing on these ruins? How 'after' is this? Are the figures strangers travelling through this landscape or did they survive its destruction? Are there any promises left on the horizon? Are there any promises left here? Are you mostly inspired by the palette and texture?
You are of course welcome to integrate elements from other Ernst works, both settings (I am oh so fond of his forests and their suns) and characters (Loplop, assorted bird people...), if your story moves away from the confines of the nominated painting and you're looking for inspiration. If you do so, please drop the titles in the notes so I won't miss any references?

Peter Darling - Austin Chant 
Peter Pan (Peter Darling)

This is one of the best books I’ve read in the last several years, I am just completely in love with it. I don’t have many explicit prompts here, but don't take that to mean I want fic for this fandom any less than for the others. It's just that I’m still mostly in the incoherent flailing stage of my love. 

One of the things I love most is exactly how much of an asshole Peter is at the beginning of the book. He has perfectly good reasons, it makes sense for him to be that way, but he has such a serious case of toxic masculinity poisoning. I’d like to see some follow-through on that now that Peter has left Neverland again. Peter has never lived openly as a man outside the power-fantasy that is Neverland, I’d love to see something about him making that adjustment.

That’s what I most want really, the afterwards. I’d love to see any part of Peter and James building their life together after Neverland.

Gun to My Head - Dira Lewis 

For this request I'd welcome fic about Sin and Dominic together or fic that focuses on just one of them.

This book just pushes SO many of my buttons. I love the age difference. I love how the balance of power in Sin and Dominic’s relationship shifts constantly throughout the book. I’m absolutely fascinated by the mythology of this universe and the politics of the vampire courts. But more than anything else I’m just completely in love with Dominic.

Brave, beautiful, foolhardy, impossible, trusting Dominic. I want SO MANY stories about Dominic. 

I would love to see what happens to Dominic directly after the events of the book. His mom’s no longer in a coma, yay! So, how exactly does he explain the vampire boyfriend he acquired and moved into their basement while she was in the hospital? I’m sure that’s going to go over great. Just like his mom will be thrilled to hear how much school he was skipping even <em>before</em> he met said vampire. 

More generally, I’d love to see the evolution of Dominic and Sin’s relationship in the future. What are they like six months on after Dominic’s finished school. In five years? Ten? Their relationship has survived a serious trial by fire, but the day-to-day stuff still takes work and Sin’s now dependent on Dominic to a degree that can’t always be easy for both of them.

Alternately, I’d also be really interested in some Sin backstory about being a queer man in pre-Quiet Revolution Quebec and how that made him vulnerable to vampiric seduction.

Scientific Method Universe - Kris Ripper 
Will Derrie, Truman Jennings, Hugh Reynolds

This is the queer, kinky, poly, found family series of my HEART. I love the realistic depiction of a variety of poly relationships. I love the kink, and the way the kink is not pasted on, but is rather an integral part of the characters and their relationships. I love the positive portrayal of Hugh’s past as a sex worker. And most of all I love that they are all a weird, queer, kinky <em>family</em>, who take care of each other and protect each other and lean on each other and just *hearteyes*

I asked for Hugh and Truman and Will, because the thing I’m most interested in is the evolution of Will and Hugh and Truman’s relationships, both in individual pairs and all three together. I also really love Will/Molly, so inclusion of Molly is entirely welcome. In supporting characters, I like Hugh’s friendship with Lucy, and Will’s friendship with Adam and Beccs, and I'm quite fond of Ally, so I'd welcome inclusion of any of them, as long as the main focus of the story stays on Hugh/Truman/Will.

I’m open to non-porny fic for this fandom, but I admit part of the appeal of this series for me is the degree to which the biggest character and relationship development happens around/within the sex scenes. I love plotty porn, and these books are the ultimate in plotty porn.

I don’t really have many prompts, so much as favorite emotional beats in the series that I’d love to see a bit more about:

My favorite part of the entire series is how long it takes Will to clue into the fact that Hugh and Truman are not just “the boyfriends”, they’re <em>his</em> boyfriends. And by “favorite”, I mean “makes me want to facepalm forever”.

That thing where Hugh is great at psychoanalyzing everyone else (especially Will), but completely shit at recognizing what’s going on in his own head? I live for that.

I recognize that it’s a tricky subject, but I’d love a closer look at Truman’s body image issues and the way Will is so good about them and Hugh, for all he doesn’t mean to be, can be <em>so bad</em>, and not even realize it until Will points it out.

I will embrace anything about Will’s intimacy kink, or Will and Hugh’s shared shrink kink.

Speaking of kink: Will and Truman’s daddy kink is tricky for me. It’s really not my kink, but Ripper mostly makes it work for me in the context of the series. But it’s enough hit or miss for me, that I’d prefer that it not be a big part of any fic I get. You don't have to ignore it altogether, references are great! I'd just prefer it not be the focus. Otherwise, if it’s in the books? I’m up for reading about it! Like Will, I have something of an intimacy kink, so I really like stories that emphasize the physical and emotional intimacy inherent in a lot of kink.

Society of Gentlemen - K. J. Charles 
Dominic Frey, Silas Mason, Julius Norreys, Harry Vane

For this request, I’m happy with fic for any two or more of my requested characters together, you don’t have to include all four of them if the story doesn’t call for it, but I'd prefer fic about the relationships between some number of them rather than about any one of them alone. I’m interested in both the canon romantic pairings and the non-romantic friendships. Please do not break up any canon couples.

I adore everyone in this series, although it took me until the last book to actually warm up to Richard, but Julius and Harry and Dominic and Silas are my absolute favorites. 

I love Harry’s very-understandable desire to escape from the economically precarious and legally chancy life he was born into. I love even more the way he then discovers that you can take the boy out of the radical politics, but you can’t take the radical politics out of the boy, and has to reconcile his new reality with the lifetime of experiences that came before.

Julius breaks my heart, and I adore watching him come back to living again through his love for Harry. Also, that thing where he initially avoids a lot of types of sex because of the intimacy inherent in them? KILLS ME. I’m such a sucker for the standoffish character forced to embrace the messy reality of human emotions.

Dominic fascinates me, more than any Tory ever should. I love how principled he is, even as I disagree with many of those principles. And I especially love how as the series goes on he has to reconcile the reality he’s witnessing day-to-day with those principles, and how when they conflict he ultimately acknowledges where his principles have been doing him poorly and adapts them.

Silas is just everything I could ever want in a character. I love and profoundly agree with his politics. I love his loyalty to his friends and his cause. I love that when he realizes that he can no longer side with the Cato Street Conspirators, he’s still unwilling to betray them. Similarly, I love his friendship with David, and the way he’s willing to help spirit him out of Richard’s house in the middle of the night, no questions asked. And I adore beyond measure that Silas gets to fall in love and get a happy romantic ending. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a character like him get that before.

For fic I’m interested in the network of relationships between these four. Some thoughts on what interests me most about each combo:

Harry and Julius: I love that in the beginning Harry half wants to be with Julius and half wants to <em>be</em> Julius. I love that the sheer joy with which Harry embraces everything around him leads Julius to break out of the shell of reserve and cynicism that he’s built around himself since the end of the wars. I love seeing two dandies together, and fic about their shared sartorial choices would be great. Also, the EARRINGS. I would love fic about them getting those matching earrings. Oh, my heart.

Dominic and Silas: I love how much Silas validates Dominic’s desires and constantly reminds him that there is nothing shameful about them. I love the characterization of Silas as Dominic’s werewolf, and how protective of Dominic he is, especially with Richard. And I love how protective of Silas Dominic is in turn. And I squeed so much when Dominic gave Harry to Silas for Christmas. Just, &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3. I love their bonding over books, and Silas introducing Dominic to radical literature. 

Harry and Silas: I love that despite the age-difference, Silas is not a father-figure to Harry, but he is a true and loyal friend. I love that when Harry’s struggling to reconcile his new position and his politics Silas doesn’t provide him with any easy answers, but makes him make his own decisions. I love Silas’s admiration for Harry’s mother, and the way, when Harry is focused on his father and his father’s family, he reminds Harry that he’s her son too. 

Julius and Silas: Oh man, they both love Harry, but these two are just so different, I don’t think they’ll ever really understand each other? But I love that despite that mutual incomprehension they come to appreciate each other because of that shared love.  I imagine their shared carriage ride to go bring David back to London in A Gentleman’s Position must have been HILARIOUS on so many levels.

Julius and Dominic: I love how at the beginning of the series Dominic is in a shared social circle with Julius, but just doesn’t <em>get</em> him at all, and vice versa. Julius finds Dominic too series, and Dominic finds Julius too frivolous, and at the beginning <em>neither of them is really wrong</em>. And I really love the way that mutual bafflement turns gradually into understanding and then friendship as the series goes on.

Dominic and Harry: I feel like I understand the relationship between these two the least, which means fic about them would be great, because I’d love to figure their relationship out.

Request 5 by FairestCat
Prosperity Series - Alexis Hall 

I pretty much want anything and everything for this fandom, so I couldn’t choose any one or two characters to request, I’ll be happy with fic about any of them!

Byron Kae/Piccadilly? Or Ruben Crowe/Milord? Or Piccadilly’s crush on Ruben Crowe? Or gen fic about any of the four of them together or separately? YES PLZ to any of it!

Some specifics would probably help though.

I love Byron Kae with the fire of a thousand suns. I think they are everything that is beautiful and good and right in this world, and they deserve all the best things and all the happiness ever. And Piccadilly? Is totally one of those best things they deserve :) I feel like pretty much everything I need to know about Byron Kae’s backstory is covered in <em>Cloudy Climes and Starless Skies</em>, so I’d prefer future-fic for them. 

Piccadilly is such a delight! I love that he’s bi, and would happily read fic that goes into that more. I feel like the best word to describe Piccadilly is <em>irrepressible</em>, and I love that! Because his background could have left him jaded, but it hasn’t at all. I love in a hurty way his crush on Ruben Crowe and the way that plays out in canon. Future-fic about his friendship with Ruben after that would be great. Maybe Piccadilly visiting Ruben and Milord in Italy? 

Byron Kae/Piccadilly: they are both such <em>joyful</em> characters, full of light and laughter and love. Show me some of that, as they have adventures together post-canon. I’d be happy with smut about them, but please be respectful of Byron Kae’s non-binary gender, and be sensitive in how you describe them in any sex scenes.

Ruben Crowe is such a fascinating character. He’s so <em>good</em> and so prone to see the best in anyone. I love how he struggles with that on first meeting Milord, who doesn’t have a lot of good to show for himself. The tension between his revulsion for what he discovers of Milord’s past actions and his strong attraction to and fascination with Milord is wonderful. I’d love a story about Ruben Crowe in the time between Milord’s escape at the end of <em>Shackles</em> and the beginning of Prosperity.

I have hugely complicated feelings about Milord. He is really not a good man, and yet I love him kind of a lot. To quote from my Goodreads review: “Maybe he doesn't deserve Ruben, maybe he doesn't deserve a happy ending, but he doesn't&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;deserve them either.” His backstory makes my heart hurt, and yet it doesn’t excuse his actions as the Crimelord of Gaslight. And he isn’t redeemed, I wouldn’t want him redeemed, but his choice to risk his life for the others at the end of Prosperity makes me love him even more. Also, he’s dying, and that matter to his character too, so please don’t erase/fix that.

Ruben Crowe/Milord: These two. THESE TWO. So fucked up and dysfunctional and helplessly in love with each other. And <em>ridiculously</em> hot together OMG. I would read anything about their relationship between Shackles and Prosperity, but I’d also love something about their future together in Italy. I think they could be less-dysfunctionally happy, for what time they have together. I’d like Milord’s illness to be acknowledge and incorporated into any future-fic, but I’d prefer to NOT get fic in which he dies/has died.

Miss Grey is not in the tagset due to character nomination limits, but I’d be happy with her inclusion in fic, but prefer her not to be the sole focus of any story.

The characters from There Will Be Phlogiston are similarly missing from the tagset, but again I'd be happy with their inclusion in fic.

The Turner Series - Cat Sebastian 
Lord Courtenay

Oh God, COURTENEY.  The thing where Courteney has spent so much of his life focused on making the people around him happy that he’s only now figuring out what makes <em>him</em> happy? Yeah, that. I really, really, really want fic about that. 

I’d especially enjoy fic set within or post-canon for this fandom. I find Courteney figuring out his interests and passions, in and out of the bedroom, really compelling. 

Our of bed: once the scandal around the “duel” with Julian has died down, does he take up his seat in the House of Lords, advocating for social reform? Or does he decide to stay in the country doing the smaller but equally important work of advocating and working for his tenants? 

In bed (or settee, other suitably appealing location): the way Julian makes Courteney ask for what he wants during sex? I find that hot as fuck AND emotionally satisfying. 

I also love the found family happy ending of this series and would take anything and everything about that, as long as Courteney is at the center of the story.

Special mention: I really found it refreshing that none of the conflict between the characters in this story had anything to do with their sexuality. Courteney has a lot of angst and shame to work through, about a lot of things, but none of those things is his queerness, and I LOVE that.

Bonus points for kittens. Because canonical kittens.

Justified 
Ava Crowder, Boyd Crowder

When I first realized Justified was setting up this pairing, I was a bit skeptical; I just didn't see it. But then I ended up LOVING Boyd and Ava, go figure, which was why I was deeply unhappy about the way things turned out between them, even though I think the last season did the best they could with fixing the problems of the previous season. My request therefore would be for either a fix-it (a different turn for their story probably starting about when the series decided to 'Lady Macbeth' Ava) or a stand-a-lone story during season 2 or 3 :)

So that's all I'm really looking for - a slow burn story where they get together. Things I would also love to see (if you'd like additional ideas) include humor or witty exchanges the two, hurt/comfort, funny/cute/odd courtship, a slight mocking of Maryanne and/or Willoughby, Edward as a best friend, and hijinks with Margaret.

Algie the Miner (1912) 
Algie Allmore, Jim (Algie the Miner)

Algie the Miner is a comedy one reeler (10 minutes) from 1912, directed by the legendary Alice Guy and starring Billy Quirk. The story is pretty simple - sheltered rich boy Algie is told to go away and prove himself a man before his girl's father will allow them to marry - but it has since become famous as an early example of gay cinema. Quirk plays Algie as a 'sissy', manages to rack up not one but two male/male kisses, and even gets a scene where he takes 'Big Jim' - the man tasked with helping him survive the Wild West - by the hand and drags him back to their shared cabin...

Prompt Ideas:

☆ Pining and so forth. All the shippy feels - it can be one sided, unrealised mutual pining, straightforward smut... it's all good! They have so much physicality between them and not a lot of privacy, what impact does that have? I love all the tropes associated with this kind of thing - watching someone sleep, trying not to get caught looking / touching, helping hands that supposedly don't mean anything, etc, etc.

☆ Backstory. What was Algie's life like before he went out West? How did he avoid getting into trouble when his first reaction to a ruggedly helpful man is to give him a kiss? Is he attracted to men? Is he aware of it? And if he is, how does that contrast with Jim's awareness of his own sexuality? (Presumably Algie was off at boarding school and college getting a classical education - Jim's more likely to have had the school of hard knocks...) And how about Jim? How does he feel about being saddled with Algie - and the reputation it might give him? How do his feelings towards Algie change over the course of the film?

☆ The Demon Drink. What made Jim turn to the drink in the first place? How does Algie keep him away from the bottle? Anything about the part of the film where Algie is helping Jim kick the habit would be awesome. Don't be afraid to pile on the melodramatic angst so beloved of the period! My absolute favourite scene is the one where Algie steps between Jim and his would be enabler, and drags him out like a jealous lover. What happens afterwards?

☆ Does Algie go through with the wedding? Does he ever see Jim again? (And how does Jim feel about it all??) Perhaps they meet up periodically, Brokeback Mountain-esque, or Algie can't bear it and heads back West. Maybe now Jim's made his fortune he wants to stay east and the two set up a bachelor household. Scandal and gossip and other associated angst are always welcome!

☆ Feel free to go for something meta too. Maybe a magazine article in the style of the times exploring the real love story, for example, or somebody in the audience making a realisation about themselves as they cheer on Jim rather than Algie's girl.

The Aliens (TV 2016) 
Lewis Garvey, Dominic (The Aliens)

I adored this show. Seriously, I'm still gutted that Channel 4 decided not to go ahead with a second series. Basically it's about an alternative history where aliens - colloquially termed 'Morks' - crash landed in the Irish Sea back in the 1980s. Originally they were integrated into British society, before being rounded up and forced into a walled ghetto known as Troy. The main character, Troy border guard Lewis Garvey, is horrified to discover in the first episode that he is actually half Mork. Luckily Dominic, a Mork cleaner who works at the border checkpoint and has a massive crush on Lewis, is there to help him make sense of it all. 

I love Dominic's intense loyalty and how committed he is to his feelings for Lewis, even when it seems so utterly hopeless. It's like Lewis just rips away all his common sense and self-preservation and just leaves him so vulnerable. On the other hand, I love Lewis' sarcastic pessimism. Nothing ever goes well for him, he doesn't expect it to go well, and yet here's this guy he has been a total dick to standing by him in spite of everything. 

Prompt Ideas:

☆ Backstory for Dominic. Has he always lived in Troy? (Is the GTA beachscape as close to the real thing as he's ever gotten?) What happened to his parents? Family? How long has he been working at the checkpoint? Why did he latch on to Lewis in the first place? Is it just because of looks, or did Lewis commit some faux pas when he started by actually talking to him / treating him like a person before he realised it wasn't the done thing? We know hardly anything about Dominic and I'd love to see his life fleshed out a little.

☆ Alternatively, give me some Lewis introspection. In retrospect, does he see clues to his real parentage? Did he always hate Morks - or was there a particular incident that made him determined to see them so negatively, beyond his sister getting hooked on fur? Speaking of fur, he's obviously tried smoking it before - what happened when it became obvious it wasn't affecting him? When the worst of the drama is over, how does he come to terms with his new identity? His initial views on Morks are awful - the whole 'if I was getting sucked off by a goat it wouldn't matter if it was male or female, it would still be disgusting' conversation in response to Dominic asking if he's into guys, for instance. How does he feel now about the things he once believed?

☆ Forced into Porn. We know that there's a market for human on Mork action, so maybe Lilyhot sets them up, or some other random Baddie decides that there is definitely money to made from a film featuring a Mork pounding a border guard. This could be super dark, or relatively light hearted, depending on how you want to play it. (Feel free to include some size kink - Dominic trying to be gentle because Lewis has never even seen a Mork guy in the all together before...)

☆ Reprisals. Lewis is becoming known as a Mork lover and somebody takes exception to that. Or Dominic is assaulted and Lewis steps in to try and rescue him - and ends up making the situation worse. Or maybe its The Alien League who decides to teach one or both of them a lesson. Hurt/Comfort would be beautiful, but I'm happy to just take the hurt!

☆ Sex Pollen, etc. As a half Mork Lewis has never been affected by smoking hair, but who's to say what other weird hybrid reactions he might have to things? Maybe Morks have a sex pollen-esque substance, or go into some kind of crazed Pon Farr state and that's part of the reason the wall was erected in the first place? 

☆ Lewis Breaks Dominic's Heart. Dominic thinks he's about to get what he's always wanted - then it turns out Lewis is intent on hurting and using him for whatever reason. The angstier the better, really, with plenty of internalised worry that he must have asked for it or lead Lewis on somehow.

Southland 
Ben Sherman, John Cooper (Southland)

I completely missed this the first time around, but I'm glad I found the show eventually! I love police procedurals (and all related genres), especially when there is a lot of focus on the interpersonal relationships. I particularly liked the set up of the viewer going in with the rookie - we learn how things work along with Ben, even as we learn more about his character and those he works with.

I'm more than happy for gen or shippy angles with this fandom. What I really like about the idea of Cooper/Sherman is how unequal it is. Cooper is physically bigger, a superior rank, older, more experienced, etc. Sherman's kind of in awe, even as he pushes against Cooper's authority, wanting the other man to take notice of him. Cooper being reluctant at first, believing that he just shouldn't go there - he's in a position of authority, he's too old, Sherman can't possibly know his own mind, etc - makes it even better, especially when Sherman does his best to prove to Cooper that he's completely serious. 

Prompt Ideas:

☆ Backstory. They both have some serious drama in their past - John's father is in prison for the rape and murder of his son's high school girlfriend, while Ben's is a successful defense lawyer who nonetheless kept company with criminals and drug dealers. I'd love something exploring their fears of turning into their fathers; John's struggle to stay clean, and perhaps Ben's realisation that he's already on the slippery slope. The danger he is putting others in through the company he's keeping, for example. Ben is a bit of a tosser by S5, there is no getting around the fact, so redemption fic would be completely welcome. Or maybe it's just too late for him to turn back and find the idealistic rookie he once was?

☆ Dirty Talk, Orgasm Denial, etc. John needs to ensure Ben can work well under pressure. Getting him worked up (and up and up) throughout the day and still demanding he be the model professional is way more fun than the methods laid out in the handbook. By the end of shift Ben is a desperate mess - just the way John likes him. Or how about Talked to Orgasm / Coming Untouched. If it's in uniform, I'll love you forever! (Seriously, those uniforms. I've no idea what the patches and shiny things all over it stand for, but I know that I like them.)

☆ Death Fic. I'm firmly in the 'Cooper made a full recovery' camp but, for the purposes of fiction and making me cry, Ben reflecting on all the things he and John never said and did would be more than welcome. Or flip it around and have John angsting over a Ben who was taken too soon.

☆ John steps in post-series. By the end of the show Ben's character was very difficult to tolerate, yet alone like. Perhaps Ben visits him in hospital after the shooting and confesses how he has messed up. John decides taking him back under his wing would be suitable thanks for Ben forcing him into rehab.

☆ Case Fic. Maybe a slice of life with the usual array of garbage calls, or perhaps one of them puts themselves at risk by investigating after hours and the other has to come to their rescue. Super serious or completely light hearted - just cops doing cop things.

☆ First Time with a Guy. Ben worries that John will lose interest if he finds out that he's never done anything with a guy before - he could not be more wrong. John wouldn't be working as a training officer if he begrudged needing to show someone how things work, after all.

Whitechapel (TV) 
Joseph Chandler (Whitechapel), Emerson Kent

I am a total sucker for historical true crime so I was always primed to be a die hard fan of this show! I loved the creepy elements of the cases, the dark humour, and the relationships between the main cast. I liked that at first glance Chandler was the typical fast-tracked career officer, but it was soon revealed that there was a lot more depth to him. Kent's eagerness to impress Chandler right from the beginning just spoke directly to my inner shipper. :)

Prompt Ideas:

☆ Hurt / Comfort. Kidnapping, injury, ruined careers, whatever you feel like - police fandoms have the best scope for this trope!

☆ Kent and the Dark Side. In S4 it was hinted that Kent was hiding some inner darkness - so let's roll with that. Maybe Kent is so desperate for Chandler to notice him he gets involved in some black magic practices, or has moved into some dingy new flat with a demonic entity just waiting to break his spirit enough for a full blown possession. Feel free to throw all the horror tropes at it. :D

☆ Matchmaking. Everyone knows about Kent's crush on his D.I... except Chandler. Somebody decides to help force things along. (If Chandler initially mistakes it for some new crazy case he has to deal with, so much the better!) It could be sickly sweet and fluffy, or equally perhaps somebody is just encouraging Kent along to see him hurt when Chandler gives him the 'thanks but no thanks' talk.

☆ Undercover as a Couple. It's so close to what Kent really wants, yet so very far away.

☆ Chandler is a complex guy with lots to deal with. I'd love anything exploring how he comes to understand himself over the course of the show - to accept his hang ups, and not to let them rule his life.

☆ Accidental Relationship. When Kent asked Chandler out for a drink the latter never realised Kent meant it as a date. Give me all the oblivious Chandler as Kent is beside himself with happiness, thinking they're just taking things (glacially) slow... Does Chandler freak out when he finally gets the message? Or is he happy with the new direction?

☆ Angst. Kent can't take it any longer and tells Chandler how he feels... Chandler isn't interested. Cue lots of beautiful heartache.

Y Gwyll | Hinterland 
Lloyd Elis

There are no words for how much I love this show - A noir murder mystery. Set in Wales. Actually filmed in Welsh! :D Its bleak creepy tone is great, and I enjoy the focus on obsession and history repeating that you get in the actual mysteries. I like all the characters (and am obviously happy for them to be included) but I've requested Lloyd specifically because we don't really know very much about him, and that makes him the perfect candidate for some exploratory fanfic to my mind.

* A note on Welsh language: I'll be fine with simple dialogue in Welsh but I'll struggle if narrative sections are written in it. My proficiency level is basically watching daytime soaps / suffering Cyw. xD *

Prompt Ideas:

☆ Case Fic. Maybe it's Lloyd's past tangled up in a case for once. Perhaps Lloyd is just going to save the day with his detective prowess. Or by accidentally stumbling on the solution. Or by getting himself kidnapped. It's all good!

☆ Ship Fic. I ship Lloyd with everyone and anyone - Alex Harries is too cute not to, really - so if you want to write him hooking up with someone, please feel free. It doesn't have to be a character on the show, even; I'm fine with OCs. Eg. Going undercover as a couple for a case and it leading to more, keeping a relationship quiet when surrounded by detectives, coming out / being outed, matchmaking that either takes or leads to some excellent hurt / comfort when his date turns out to be the murderer... 

☆ Backstory / Family. Why did Lloyd join the police force? What are his ambitions? Did he ever move away from Wales like Matthias, or is home where his heart is?

☆ Cracky Crossover. I was very into Pobol y Cwm back when Harries was a regular and I still watch it occasionally, so... Maybe Scott is a twin separated at birth / some other murder mystery trope. Maybe he's the dark past Lloyd wants to leave behind. Perhaps some resident of Cwmderi mistakes Lloyd for Scott and wants to mete out their own punishment. I dunno, I feel like there's scope in the idea for all kinds of madness!

The Sandbaggers 

Any character or combination is fine.  

Gen definitely preferred – a nice twisty plot that shows Machiavellian machinations with a surprise ending please.  My plot bunnies include characters not nominated but please don’t feel you have to include any of the non-nominated characters.  I offer these in case they <i>help</i>, so if they don’t please ignore them. I am sure I will like any idea you come up with as I adore this fandom and cannot get enough of it.  

<u>Possible ideas:</u>  Jeff Ross comes into his own and for once runs rings round Neil.  Perhaps Wellingham teams up with Willie to manipulate Neil.  Why not tell us a story of Neil as a baby Sandbagger?  How about the first op Neil ran as D.Ops (and his unease at sitting in the chair sending out his agents instead of being out there himself)?  How did Neil and Willie become such good friends?  Was that because of an op where they had to depend on each other in a ‘life-and-limb’ situation? Marianne becomes a Sandbagger and proves herself exceptionally good (turns out she’s more efficient than Willie and even more twisty than Neil).  What would happen if, in Whitehall machinations, for once John Tower Gibbs and Neil were on the same side against Sir Geoffrey Wellingham?  The Russian who paired up with Willie Caine in Cyprus resurfaces on another op, with Willie again - or maybe this time it is Burnside or Jeff Ross who is bowled over. How about backstory?  Tell us about the time Neil had to make a critical decision and was one over the limit.  I love this fandom and anything you write will be a ‘plus’.

Stalky and Co - Rudyard Kipling 

Any character or combination is fine.  

I definitely prefer Gen for this fandom.  What I really want is another ‘chapter’ with Study 5 up to its usual Machiavellian antics, getting the best of the masters, but the Head (at least) being the downy bird that he is, and possibly the Padre, seeing through it.  Though if you want to reverse things a bit and have King get the upper hand for once, I can live with that.  Whatever it is, I would prefer you remain true to canon. My plot bunnies include characters not nominated but please don’t feel you have to include any of the non-nominated characters. I offer these in case they <i>help</i>, so if they don’t please ignore them.

<u>Possible Ideas:</u> Stalky pushing the boundaries in some way and getting getting back at King.  Alternatively: Stalky becomes King’s greatest supporter (much to that master’s chagrin).  Or throw a new element into the equation: there is a new boy at school who is terribly ‘pi’ and non-comformist to boot.  How does Study 5 deal with him?  In ‘Stalky’ it is De Vitre in a jam and Stalky who rescues.  The next week it is De Vitre who gets Stalky out of a jam, much to his chagrin and the amusement of Beetle and M’Turk.  Or: Prout decides to break up Study 5 by shuffling the trio round into other studies with other boys – mayhem ensues until the Study is reunited.  Stalky on campaign in India (a crossover with <i>Kim</i> would be much appreciated).

Kim - Rudyard Kipling 

Any character or combination is fine.  

<u>Optional Details:</u> I definitely prefer Gen for this fandom.  What I really want is more of Kim playing The Great Game and running rings round English, Indians and Russians like.  I really like the 'east meets west' theme that runs throughout this novel with the strong message that using a bit of both is a strength and that anyone who looks down on the other is at distinct disadvantage.  I love the implicit criticism of the Raj for doing just that.  

<u>Possible Ideas:</u> An older and wiser Kim runs a string of spies instead of being one himself but has to come out of 'retirement' when there is real danger of invasion.  Any crossover with <i>Stalky</i> or any of the stories in <i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i> would be much appreciated.  What about Kim relocated to the south, away from the Northwest Frontier he knows so well.  A mission told from the perspective of Hurree Babu or Mahbub Ali.  Kim in England and his perspective on the peculiarities of English customs and the class system. Or, Kim in Ireland (after all he is part Irish) - how do his relatives take to his Indian side, and how does he take to them?

Alexander Trilogy - Mary Renault 

Any character or combination is fine.  

This is a perennial favourite; who <i>cannot</i> cry along with Bagoas when Alexander dies? I am very fond of stories which include minor characters interacting with one or more of the major characters in ways which reveal more of the subtleties of either relationships or ethical dilemmas.  My plot bunnies include characters not nominated but please don’t feel you have to include any of the non-nominated characters. I offer these in case they <i>help</i>, so if they don’t please ignore them.  Although I generally prefer Gen this is one of the fandoms in which I have actually written a couple of sex scenes – semi-explicit (but not very).  Please see my own fan-fic on AO3 if you want to see the kind of sensual-sex-to-fade-out thing that matches my taste.  

<u>Possible Ideas:</u> Show us more of Alexander’s campaigns before he and Bagoas meet.  If you want to show them from someone else’s perspective (e.g. Perdikkas, Ptolemy, Antipater, etc) all the better.  Alexander, Hephaistion and Roxane: the eternal triangle.  Alexander and Sisygambis: show us their relationship developing.  Eurydike channelling the shade of Alexander.  Kleopatra as she grows up.  Life in the Persian harem: the women’s power bases and how they change as Darius loses control and Alexander’s campaigns continue.  Bagoas after Alexander’s death: how does he rebuild his life?

The Last of the Wine - Mary Renault 

Any character or combination is fine.  

As always, I really would like something that explores Phaedo; but having said that, if he is not the character that grabs your attention, that is OK as I would be extremely pleased with anything based on this novel; it remains my favourite of the Renault historicals.  My plot bunnies include characters not nominated but please don’t feel you have to include any of the non-nominated characters. I offer these in case they <i>help</i>, so if they don’t please ignore them.  Although I generally prefer Gen this is one of the fandoms in which I have actually written a couple of sex scenes – semi-explicit (but not very).  Please see my own fan-fic on AO3 if you want to see the kind of sensual-sex-to-fade-out thing that matches my taste.  

<u>Possible ideas:</u> Anything which sheds a bit more light on Phaedo’s character. For example: how did he manage during the siege of Athens? Alternatively: explore the relationship Phaedo has with Sokrates. Or: what is Phaedo’s relationship with one or more of the following: Lysis, Kritias, Plato or Xenophon?  Or (post-book) how did Phaedo react to Sokrates’ death?   Ideas for non-Phaedo stories:  Lysis and Thalia – what was their relationship like?  Tell us something from Arete’s point of view.  What does she think of Alexias’ decision to divert money he earns during the siege toward helping Lysis instead of buying food for his sister Charis, and mother (and unborn brother)?  Or how about Arete quietly learning philosophy from Alexias, with him all unknowing, but her conclusions, coloured by the position of women in Athenian society, are distinctly different from the ones Alexias draws.  Myron watches Alexias as he grows up, seeing the parallels and opposites between his son and himself in their choices and experiences.  Show the progression of Lysis’ relationship with Alexias as seen through the eyes of their fathers.  How about a glimpse of the future?  Perhaps Alexias’ son Myron shows a talent for pankration, and watching his son practice reminds Alexias of seeing Autolykos compete.  What was it like to be Sokrates’ son or wife and see him spend so much of his time and attention on people who were not his family?

The Mask of Apollo - Mary Renault 

Any character or combination is fine.  

I haven't requested this for a few years because it hasn't always been nominated for Yuletide.  Fortunately it is in the tagset this year.  If you want to write sex scenes in a story within this fandom that is OK but I generally prefer sensual scenes rather than explicit.  

<u>Possible ideas:</u> If you look back over previous requests you will see one recurring plot bunny: Thettalos as a spy for Alexander.  That said, I will enjoy anything set within this novel.  A story that shows Thettalos or Nikeratos in a play (perhaps as rivals for a contest?).  We know both are dramatic actors; show them doing comedy (maybe for a dare or to help out some fellow actors who are in a jam) - do they find it more demanding than they original thought it would be?  How about a farce: the gods decide to interfere and merry mayhem ensues.  Plato teaching Axiothea.  Backstory about Axiothea - how did she get permission to study with Plato?  Thettalos is the younger; how does he fare after Nikeratos' death?

A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara 
Willem Ragnarsson (A Little Life), Jude St. Francis (A Little Life)

I tore through this book in a little more than a day and then spent the next few weeks going back to read my favorite passages which, as you might guess given my request, almost always featured Jude and Willem. I loved their relationship and would particularly like a glimpse of their college friendship, little things like: getting snowed in and watching a terrible movie; eating bad food in the dining hall; helping each other with assignments. If that period doesn't work for you, I'd be happy with a glimpse of their relationship in their later years as well - my only request is that it not be bleak.

Dark Matter (TV) 
Two | Portia Lin, Five | Das, Three | Marcus Boone, The Android (Dark Matter)

I was so disappointed when this show was canceled! I would love to see more of these characters, and I suppose I'm not too picky as to where you go with it. I also picked the four characters I did because they are my favorites, but I don't need the story to feature all of them (though if you'd like to, that would be great!). Focusing on one or some of the characters I chose is totally fine with me. The only thing I would not particularly like is anything romantic between Five and the other characters, as her relationship with the other characters has always had a greater parental/sibling vibe to me. I also would prefer something without a sad ending. If you would like to write a what-comes-next for after the finale, that would work for me, or if you'd like to write a slice-of-life from their future, that would be great, too. A smaller story about one or two characters would work as well, something as simple as two of them having dinner and talking about something that's happened, or a missing moment from the earlier seasons. I just really came to love these characters and their connections with each other and would love to see more of them.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye

The Good Place has become one of my favorite shows, and the dynamic between Eleanor and Chidi is one of the things I love the most about it. I would love to see a story focusing on their connection - perhaps a story about one of one (or more) of the previous attempts that were rushed through in episode 3? A missing moment from the first season? What if they had stayed in The Medium Place?
Or maybe a glimpse of one (or more) of their times in The Medium Place? Or if something is happening currently in the show that you would like to explore, that would be fine, too. What I like the most about their connection is how their sharp edges bump up against each other and prompt each of them toward their better selves - Eleanor losing some of her selfishness, Chidi absorbing some of Eleanor's decisiveness and bravery.

Vorkosigan Saga - Lois McMaster Bujold 
Gregor Vorbarra, Miles Vorkosigan, Ivan Vorpatril

I don't know how much to ask you for, since I don't want to limit you too much. There isn't that much which squicks me, although unhappy endings and major character death would be on the list. I am fascinated by these characters, and especially the relationship between them, as complicated as it is with political loyalty, familial affection, the whole Barrayaran masculinity warrior thing. I love slash, but it's not necessary. Please go wherever interests you with this story. If you feel like a prompt, it would be cool to read something about these characters as boys/teens, getting mixed up with some kind of Imperial scheme or plot.

It would be totally fantastic if you slashed Psmith/Mike, since I think they're glorious together. I dislike sad endings and major character deaths, but I wouldn't mind you taking on some of the more realistic aspects of Edwardian England. That is to say, don't feel like you have to copy the Wodehouse style of fun hijinks; although you certainly can if you want to.

I especially adore Esca and his history and characterization as seen through the film, so if you just want to focus on him, that would be great too. I dislike sad endings and major character deaths, but anything else is on the table.

People of Earth (TV 2016) 

DNW gore or angst without a happy ending. General likes are in my letter!

I'm requesting Any here. Worldbuilding stories are also welcome!

- The immediate aftermath of the season two finale, whatever you personally think that’s going to be!

- More of Alex and Jasmine getting to know each other, or Alex meeting her mother.

- Alex femslash! Maybe with Gina?

- Yvonne/Gerry, being cute and domestic, sexy, or working together to foils Eric’s plan.

- Yvonne is an underutilized character. I’m fascinated by how she handles her experience with the aliens; she seems to be so together when she’s out in public, but the moment you walk into her home there are grenades in the light fixtures. Give me a slice of life fic where we see how her paranoia effects her everyday life.

- Kurt was killed (again) when that truck hit him. Fortunately, this time Jeff knows exactly what to do.

- Somehow Ennis ends up finding and helping Jeff while Jeff is stranded on Earth.

- After sneaking aboard the ship to save StarCrossed Jonathan is faced with the possibility that he might have to leave Ozzie’s body behind – so he kisses him in a last-ditch effort to revive him.

- Turns out Jeff (the Greys?) just happens to be able to bring people back to life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It’s not going to work for anyone but Jeff so Jonathan tries to convince him to kiss Ozzie.

- Don is freed from Eric’s control part way through StarCrossed’s escape. He wasn’t aware of what he was doing while possessed and he’s confronted by Kelly, on the ship, pissed off that he’s an alien.

- Kelly and Ozzie interacting, especially after Ozzie’s resurrection when he understandably needs his sponsor but Kelly’s also dealing with shit of her own.

- One of the alien characters (not necessarily Jonathan; it would be funny to see one of the others, instead) finally makes contact with a group of rogue aliens on Earth. Do the tenets of Jeff’s Mutiny mesh with the actual rebellion already underway?

- Kurt gets the opportunity to tell Jeff how <i>he</i> feels.

- Show me a StarCrossed meeting!

- . . . Alien/alien or human/alien sex or lead up to sex, especially if it involves the characters trying to decide how the interspecies thing is going to work. I'm particularly interested in Kurt/Jeff, Ozzie/Jonathan, or Kelly/Don, but if there's another pairing you have ideas for I'll be thrilled to read about it!

&gt;&gt; Option 1: He’s just genuinely evil, and somehow benefitted by destroying(?) the US – or the world. What was he getting out of it?
&gt;&gt; Option 2: He was trying to fix some wrong. What was so bad that he risked changing time without calculating a safe solution?

- Danny (and the rest of the team) go back in time to confront John in the past. Maybe they can only go back to a different time/place and have to do a lot to find him?

- Straight-up hatesex.

- While the team is trying to find John he manages to get Danny alone and tries to plead his case.

- After John has been captured and his mess reversed Danny starts visiting him in prison for ~reasons~

Powerless (TV 2017) 

DNW gore or angst without a happy ending. General likes are in my letter!

I'm requesting Any here. Worldbuilding stories are also welcome!

- Ron/Van. Look, there was that one fic with them and it worked for me, okay. In fact, Van being a faily romantic partner for anyone would be great. I don’t think anyone would stick it out with him for long, but it’ll be fun to read about while it lasts. Probably the person who would stay the longest is Emily, I think, because she tries so hard to see the best in people . . . Jackie would last the shortest amount of time (but she’d manage to come out of it with a sports car or a lake house).

- Wendy/Van. Maybe during the day that didn’t happen? Just raw sexual attraction and regret.

- Wendy went through a wormhole and came back with two years having passed for her . . . please elaborate!

- Jackie keeps reluctantly having to use her superpowers, which is bad enough, but then the Justice League (or whoever) starts paying attention to her and she just doesn’t have time for this, okay?

- Office hijinks: a prank war, the perils of office dating, competing to have a project approved, etc.

- Green Fury/Emily. This isn’t what Emily thought dating a superhero would be like.

- Ron/Teddy. Maybe Ron takes Teddy to Atlantis?

- Emily gets to go to the head office in Gotham!
&gt;&gt; Van is incredibly jealous and keeps trying to come up with reasons he should come too/she should stay behind.
&gt;&gt; Van actually does go with her but Emily has to stop him from embarrassing himself and/or getting their division shut down.
&gt;&gt; Emily runs into a Gotham resident of your choice! (I’m fond of Batwoman but seriously anyone is good!)
&gt;&gt; Emily makes a big presentation at the head office and kills it, perhaps earning praise from Bruce Wayne himself.

- Now that I think of it, Green Fury/Batwoman would be amazing.

The Chrysalids - John Wyndham 

DNW gore or angst without a happy ending. General likes are in my letter!

- The adventures of Michael and Rachel trying to make their way to Zealand post-canon! 

- David, Rosalind, and/or Petra’s experiences when they first arrive in Zealand!

- An AU where the group were never found out!
&gt;&gt; The other boy in their group isn’t killed by a fallen tree and crisis is averted when he and Anne fall in love. The other girls are more reasonable about not having a fellow telepath to marry . . . but what is their solution?
&gt;&gt; The group comes up with various reasons for all of them to leave the area and move to the city. Is it safer for them there? Are there any other mutants hiding in the city?
&gt;&gt; When another Fringe group begins making trouble and tries to get government attention, some or all of the group finds a way to help them out.

- Worldbuilding:
&gt;&gt; The travels of a sailor, perhaps even Uncle Axel, on a trip down south, and all the hints of the past they see (this could also work for my Michael and Rachel prompt!).
&gt;&gt; Who was the Nicholson of Nicholson's Repentances? What was the world like when they were writing?
&gt;&gt; The history of one of the other surviving human populations described in the book. 

- Future!Petra returns to Waknuk, maybe to see if other telepaths have been born in the area since her youth, or maybe just to see her parents and childhood home.

I'd love to see some world-building - exorcists' politics, lore etiquette etc. And also the study of this wonderfully ambiguous and tangled relationship these two has in canon. Pastfic, casefic (maybe Natsume is in danger and they have to unite to help him? maybe one of them is hurt and the other has to take care of him? all these good old foe-tropes would be very much welcomed here - either in shippy, or in gen, \"antagonistic smarm\" version), some sort of exorcists meeting, just them competing with each other (for Natsume, for glory, for the fame) - I'd be pleased with everything. Adding a touch of folklore would be a very nice, but absolutely not required bonus.

Fic about their feelings towards Takashi is always welcomed, too! Or about Natsume getting to know the exorcists’ world better.

Conan the Adventurer (Cartoon) 
Mesmira (Conan the Adventurer), Greywolf (Conan the Adventurer), Wrath-Amon (Conan the Adventurer)

DNW:
– AUs, except for the ones mentioned below, 
– fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, 
– Mpreg, sex pollen, aliens make them do it,
– crossovers/fusions, 
– parent-children incest, 
– underage (&lt; 13 years),
– watersports, scat, vomit, snuff,
– abortion/miscarriage, children's deaths,
- real-world religions bashing.

Could be treated like OR request. Feel free to use other, non-requested characters! General list of likes etc. - in the letter.

It's one of my favourite childhood cartoon. I dreamt about it and plotted a thousands stories in its setting. I was fascinated by Warth-Amon and his relationship with Seth and with his (tricked) subjects - I'd love some fic exploring his position in the Seth hierarchy of beings, his motivations, his manipulations and/or his cruelty. So, character study, basically. I'd also be interested in the world-building and/or politics/religion side of his everyday life. If you would like to write about him and Wingfang, I'm totally OK with that (I shipped both Wingfang and Wrath-Amon with Jasmine, but that's just the bonus info, since she isn't nominated - I don't expect you to use it, although, if you want to, I won't mind).

In fact, world-building is my general request for this canon - Conan's world seemed very rich, with quite a few different cultures. We only saw glimpses of them, and I'd love to see them explored, enriched and brought to life.

Mesmira, if my memory serves me right, had wonderfully foe-yayish relationship with Conan, but I was - and still am - more interested in shifting it into Greywolf (i use \"foe-yay\" as both erotic and platonic term, here), probably because the stakes are much higher there. The emotions, including hate, are much stronger, too. And there's this deal with his siblings into the background, which would make the whole relationship even more intense - and, probably, based either on abuse/simple violence or deception (promises of bringing them back to their human-selves? threatening their lives? or Greywolf having an upper hand and trying to force her to help them?). They're reluctant allies in some episodes and I would love to see it explored, too. Or just something happening after the series, when they're forced to at least sometimes meet each other - and while they have be civil in public, in private they like to struggle for dominance (erotically, via banter, via science/politics). I don't mind either gen, erotic or porn version of their relations.

Tortures, interrogations, manipulations, mindbreaking etc. as per usual - warmly welcomed, although absolutely not necessary. I also might be interested in Greywolf-his sibling incest, especially, but not only, the forced one (the only way to break the curse). But without the xeno/bestiality - so at this one night, when the wolves become human again. Presence/active participation of Mesmira in this scenario would be a very nice bonus.

Die Räuber | The Robbers - Schiller 
Karl Moor (Die Räuber), Franz Moor (Die Räuber), Amalia von Edelreich (Die Räuber)

Could be treated like OR request. General likes etc. - in the letter.

DNW:
– AUs, except for the ones mentioned below, 
– fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, 
– Mpreg, 
– crossovers/fusions, 
– parent-children incest, 
– underage (&lt; 13 years),
– watersports, scat, vomit, snuff,
– abortion/miscarriage, children's deaths.

Manipulation and betrayal all the way! Or a sweet, fluffy kidfic, as I really, really love them. Or a hinting-at-the-future, gloomy kidfic, whatever you prefer! I’d be very interested in seeing relationship brother Moors have with their father – he had to make some epic mistakes in their upbringing, after all – but please, no portraying him as a terrible, physically abusive father. It were different times, of course, and taking that into account (e.g. physical punishment, duty before the emotions etc.) would be very warmly welcomed.

I’d like also be interested in seeing the relationship between Karl&amp;/Franz&amp;/Amalia either during the play or earlier. How did brothers try to win her favour? What mistakes Franz did do?

And, of course, these glorious foe-yay vibes between Franz&amp;Karl! I'd love to see their rivalry and obsession with each other - some kind of AU/in-between fic in which one of them is a prisoner of another (and then we have interrogations and ambivalent emotions, and tortures, and possible hatesex or rape! or forced intimacy and taking care for your enemy, and other similar wonderful tropes) would be great, but I'd also be interested in seeing their differences played in more \"normal\" familial situation.

Some kind of everybody-lives-and-is-miserable AU would be great for exploring all their familiar dynamics, too.

Pillars of Eternity 
Galven Regd (Pillars of Eternity), Lliras (Pillars of Eternity), Aloth Corfiser, Edér Teylecg

DNW: non-canonical character death, fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, crossovers/fusions, AUs, watersports, scat, vomit. I strongly prefer female Watcher.

This is an OR request, definitely. Also, feel free to use other canonical characters in your fic. General likes etc. - in the letter.

I love the world-building in this game! exploring it, either on the spiritual/scientific or historical level (I adore the history of Galven Regd and Hadrets, their respect for each other despite the ideological differences and that tiny little thing called war, so if you would like to explore it, I'd be absolutely thrilled! I love the foe-yayish vibes I got from it - by don't feel pressured into making it a romance, some sort of \"enemy of mine\", \"honourable enemy\", conflict of loyalties, forced presence and other antagonistic friendship - or friendly antagonists - tropes are my jam, too!). I'd love to see something about Dyrwood's politics, too, at any point of time. Or about Orlan's culture - Twin Elms was the most fascinating location for me. Lliras and Regd requests could easily lead to such a world-building story. Or a story about the beginning of the Dyrwood, their road to independence, their politics and ideals there (and maybe Thaos played a part in that story, too?).

I love the pets, this menagerie we’re collecting during the game, so you can make them part of the background, too (or just mention them in one line, that’s all I need).

As for prompts (only if you need them, if you have your idea, go for it!):
- any kind of team-bonding (not necessarily the pleasant way; I think arguments, fighting and crisis could bring people together, too, and I'd gladly read about this kind of familiarity/bonding).
- Crack or fluff about our team and it’s adventures (or leisure time in Caed Nua).
– The theme of loyalty, duty, obligation and faith - it's very interesting part of the game, and any kind of the scene/situation/interaction which would show what one (or more) of these means to a character - or how different characters understands these terms - would be welcome.
- Some cracky-crack about any of the characters or some post-game adventures of the characters,
- Lliras and his father, Lliras and the Twin Elm's culture - he decided to betray his father, why? Because of moral code? Because of some kind of attachment to the child's family (maybe anything, from the friendship to forbidden romance)? Because he found it an political opportunity? to get a rid of his father? To spite on his father? The options are almost infinitive and I'd love all of them;
- Aloth relationship with his family and/or himself/Iselmyra and/or Thaos and The Key (either as a past fic, or in a version when he became the double agent) - I'd love to read something about it;
- Eder and his relationship with his faith (with pets ;)) or some bittersweet fic about his past/childhood? his life in the village, him making his peace with the fact that he doesn't belong there anymore; or him and some of the other companions, especially Sagani, Aloth or Durace (they must have many passionate discussion about religion!)

I’d be happy with some porn/romance, too. Any of those characters would be fine, but I’ve got a soft spot for Aloth-Iselmyr-Eder interactions/pararomance. And I’m most certainly not opposing to throwing the Watcher into this mess. Or making it dub-con (consent issues are inevitable in such situation, I think). Or playing with the traumas all of them have (Aloth and his father, Eder and the war and everything which came after it, the Watcher and… whatever you would like to write her, she’s completely tabula rasa after all) – be it in either totally safe, sane, consensual (fear play would be fascinating, I’m sure) or more dark/dub-con manner. Humour/crackish piece about them would make me very happy, too.

Star Wars Legends: Knights of the Old Republic 
Dustil Onasi, Canderous Ordo (KotOR), Carth Onasi (KotOR), Female Revan (Star Wars) (KotOR)

DNW: 
- If you're going the dark!Revan route, no mentions of the Mission's fate, please (unless you would like to explicitly stated that she is all right. well, not dead at least). – AUs, except for the ones mentioned below, 
– fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, 
– Mpreg, 
– crossovers/fusions, 
– parent-children incest, 
– underage (&lt; 13 years),
– watersports, scat, vomit, snuff,
– abortion/miscarriage, children's deaths.

This request could be treated like an OR one. Feel free to include KoTORII plot&amp;world-building and other, non-requested canonical characters. As for MMO – I haven’t played them, but I have nothing against its bits of canon. I dislike the Legends novel, though. Other general likes - in the letter.

I've got a great Canderous&amp;Carth fic in the previous years. Since I'm a greedy person, I asked for more this year – but please, don't feel like you have to write something similar to the previous one. Or something much different. I'm just very constant when it comes to favourite canons.

Pairings:

F!Revan/Carth
F!Revan/Canderous
Carth/Canderous
F!Revan/Carth/Canderous

As for not requested character pairings, if you are interested in writing them (if not, that's absolutely fine, the list is just in case)

Dustil/Mission
F!Revan/Malak

Prompts, if you need them:

– Conderous is a warrior, Carth is a soldier. That makes for a very interesting team dynamics. They could hate each other, but they had to work together and I like to think they grudgingly came to respect each other. So, there’s a place for snarky banters, fights (not only over ideas and war, but over Revan, too) and missions endangered by their disagreements.Tropes like honourable enemies (or even enemies to lovers! Yaaay!) comes into play, and these are my favourite tropes! Feel free to throw the rest of the crew into the fic, I don’t mind – but it’s of course not necessary, the interactions between Ordo and Carth – any interactions – would be enough to make me very, very happy. 
– Crack stories about their arguments in the mess-room and/or the tricks they played on each other would be great, too. 
– And I’d never say no to the porn. Just not sweet, fluffly one. Dub– and non-con are fine, elements of BDSM are fine, too. 
– I absolutely adore Revan/Carth, it’s my favourite game-pairing of all time, I think. I love it in every version, even the sickly sweet one. I’d be interested in their interaction in game and post-game – finding how to be in relationship during more normal times, without this whole “saving the world” deal. I think that would be especially challenging to Revan, for she, as a Jedi, didn’t have much experience with the family life. 
– I’d like to see them interacting with Dustil. Or just character piece focused on Dustil: how did he feel about his father relationship with Revan? We know that he somehow reconcile with his father, at least in the “good game path”, but I’m sure this process was in fact long, bumpy and full of tensions. I’d love to see explored! I think that post-game Mission could be a great friend (or something more!) for Dustil, but feel forced to include her, as I don't request her.
– Things which fascinate me in Canderous/Revan are similar to what I like in Canderous/Carth – past enemies, power imbalance, tension. But their friendship, even if tensed, is IMHO real – Revan helped him find a new purpose in life and I feel like he changed her a little, too.
– Dark AU in which Revan decided not to kill Carth (because of love/possession/irony/etc.) and instead made her toy/pet/official lover. I’d be interested in both porny and plotty/psychological version of that.
– Sith!Dustil would be fascinating addition to this dynamic (would he be jealous? angry? would he has any privileges because of that or be just another pawn in Revan’s game? maybe she would be using him to punish his father – or maybe he would be the one doing the punishing). HK-47 could be probably used as very eloquent fucking machine.
– I'm not opposed to Ordo as another lover – less forcefully taken – and his relations with Carth in such scenario.

Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) 
Vernon Roche (Witcher Games), Iorveth (Witcher Games)

– AUs, except for the ones mentioned below, 
– fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, 
– Mpreg, 
– crossovers/fusions, 
– parent-children incest, 
– underage (&lt; 13 years),
– watersports, scat, vomit, snuff,
– abortion/miscarriage, children's deaths
- ideological/freedom fight and/or patriotism being treated as a purely bad, black thing in narration (characters can think whatever suits them; I'm also most definitely not oppose to showing how cruel, for foes and civilians, both ideological fighters and special forces could be, how devastating they are for people's psyche etc., etc., etc. I'd just prefer if the narration didn't bash the above concepts completely; being fair and realistic in approach to them is much welcomed),
- Ves being raped/tortured. 

Feel free to use other, non-requested canonical characters. As for the letter - it's the list of my general likes&amp;dislikes.

Honestly, I just love the foe-yay between these two in the game. That's it. It could be treated like a ship or a purely gen relation - with lots of manipulation, tortures, interrogations, betrayals, conflicted loyalties, forced proximity and whatever other trope about ambiguous relationships you like. I like the conflicted emotions and emotional intensity, and not-killing-each-other-but-always-being-close - if they're a part of the erotic or platonic story, is of no consequence for me and do not influence my enjoyment. I don't care which of them has upper hand, too. When it comes to Iorveth and Roche you can do no wrong (unless you made them fluffy or healthy ship, since I crave the conflict and the danger - the canonical type of relation is totally fine). 

As for little details: I like Roche's hips, especially in the second game, his gloves, especially the difference in feeling/touch between of the leather and the skin and the very... sensual... way in which game shows us him killing (in Vergen, after falling from that bridge, for example). For Iorveth, I probably loves his ruthlessness, cruel idealism and some kind of hypocrisy (he did betray the cause for woman, after all), especially when I imagine his reaction upon realising that. I like the portrayal of his disability, too, the way he doesn't seem to care about it at all. And of course his tactically-stupid obsession about Roche. I prefer his name in Polish version - Iorweth - because that's the way it was spelled in the books, but it's a little preference, so if you don't like it, use the English version, I wouldn't mind.

When it comes to Iorveth and Roche all of the most 'tropiest', 'iddy' cliches works for me. Them being forced to cooperate before, during or after the Witcher II (even in some kind of canon-divergence AU, in this case I don't mind), with or without inclusion of the plot of the third game (or the delete materials, e.g. Iorveth in Novigrad), them being on the same diplomatic negotiations, them dying from the boredom on the diplomatic ball, them trying to kill each other (but somehow always failing, for some very suspicious reasons. like in the canon), one of them having to take care of the other (for political/tactical reasons, of course. purely. or to humiliate him), fighting, fucking, raping (I'm not opposed to the idea of Roche being gang-banged by the whole commando. or Iorveth's sharing his favourite toy with Ciaran, if that strikes your fancy - it's not nominated, so it's just an additional idea) talking, interrogating (the scene in the dungeon convinces me Roche was actually good at this job. and he knew how to play the good cop. and I love false gentleness, especially in interrogators), torturing, nurturing, pampering like a pet/prisoner of war, licking boots, whatever. I especially love the scenarios when one of them mixes abuse and caring gestures, but, really, everything and anything will be fine. All my general likes apply to them and that's the pure beauty of the canon for me.

I don't mind throwing Saskia into it - I've got the impression that she, for all her goodness and caring, is a rather pragmatic person. Elves are a good archers, Vergen don't have many units, Scoia'tael are useful, Iorveth's calmness and good mood are important and Roche is a war criminal - Iorveth's, frankly, too, it's one of the many wonderful thing about this ship - so it's probably not a terrible injustice if he is to be punished and treated like a pet or a (sex)toy for a while. Although I'm sure she wouldn't let Iorveth hurt him too much... but 'not too much' it still left many interesting options, especially remembering that she's a dragon.

The Baby Sitters Club Club (Podcast) 
Jason Jasonson, Wandering Frog People, Goliath Hardbody

I love Jack's eager attempts at actual intellectual discourse and how Tanner crushes them, over and over again. I love the elaborate readings of the text and how even the mundane things, like a game called Wandering Frog People, turns into a vast global conspiracy. I would love a fic where Goliath Hardbody and his workforce (Jason Jasonson was the only one I could definitively confirm through Google, but I'm certain there's Mike Mikerson and a David Davidson as well if you wanted to include them) are caught up in this global conspiracy of the Wandering Frog People. What must they do to be safe? Who is the 'Eve' who started this all? What happens to people who have lost the game? Is this any relation to The Game? (You just lost The Game).

If you were feeling bold and wanted to crossover with The Baby Sitters Club Club RPF and include Jack and Tanner, I would definitely not object. 

If you have a different idea, go wild! My only hard DNW is shipping Jack/Tanner. Please also don't include the girls, I don't see why they need to be involved.

Injection (Comics) 
Vivek Headland

Headland is my favorite character, but I love the whole 3CU. I'd really love anything that gives us backstory into Headland. Headland's past with Rubedo is an interesting avenue to potentially explore. Because he MUST have a past with them. There's way too many subtle hints dropped for this to be just knowledge he happens to know. But anything with his past will do. A logician and an ethicist walk into a bar … Or how did he get to be such partnership with Lucy? How did she come to trust him? What incidents led to their code? In another vein, any Robin/Viv whether present or backstory, romantic or otherwise, would be interesting. Especially since they are such different personalities. Super bonus points for unreliable narrator and/or The Injection with them. I also like Headland's banter with Red. \"I believe there should be a deduction for being a show off fucker\" sums up their relationship nicely. Banning Noble from speaking because he thinks television has got worth watching is as problematic as it is amusing. I would enjoy slice-of-life with Headland and his staff that doesn't try to take itself too seriously - which television Noble?! Defend your premise!

DNW: Viv as Sherlock Holmes. Yea, he's got this uncanny demeanor, but he's not the reincarnation of him, or whatever. Leave Headland Headland. Mostly cos Maria wears it better, but that's not an invitation to Sherlock her up either. One thing I definitely do not want is an ensemble fic. Or Headland/Lucy in a romantic pairing.

Manifest Destiny (Comics) 

I like fighting monsters and the aftermath of fighting monsters. I love conflict about what to do next. I like the small peaceful moments they can have in the wild west. I love distrust and unreliable narrators. If you wanted to do an AU: Sacajawea and the baby - what if at any point she loses the baby? Does that change the nature of the story? Or what if she says more during her fever dream that lets everyone realize her true 'sacrifice' intent? What if York picks up enough of a Native language and is offered his freedom if he turns on his white captors? What if Lewis falls in 'love' with a Native? What if Magdalene has had enough of this BS and she and the girls go out on their own? What if she's actually treated as an equal? What if it was Clark and Magdalene on the boat and Lewis and York on the shore? No matter what I'd like to see Magdalene and York as allies and/or York and Sacajawea as allies. 

DNW: Rape as a tragic backstory, rape as a plot point, nominated character death, Natives as villains, the dumbing down of clearly intelligent characters, kidfic (outside of Sacajawea's baby)

Oh what tales we weave, when first we learn to deceive. I want happy endings for my fabulously flawed characters!

Ballister being all sciency and Goldenloin being all dramatic and the two of them being so stupidly stubborn and Nimona all 'wtf did I come back for if this is what I was getting?' but also the notion of found family and forgiveness and learning to move forward. And loyalty and trust and how the two don't have to go hand in hand but often do, and how you can love someone but not condone everything they do and if there were unreliable narrators all throughout this, it would be fantastic.

Paper Girls (Comics) 
Tiffany (Paper Girls), MacKenzie Coyle

I offered these two together, but if something takes you in a direction that is for only one of them, go for it! I only ask that if you're not including the other nominated character, you don't include KJ or Erin either.

I love Paper Girls, the end. Time-travel and crossing streams, and nothing is as it seems. So many questions. So many rules that don't seem to make sense. How many Erin's are there, actually? I would love any flash-forward or flash-back sequences, alternative timelines, things that never happened but could have, things that still could happen, basically anything that plays with time and stories. Telling the same story multiple times with slight changes each time to play with butterfly theory (the girls wind up in a diner in 1950. In one version, Mac has her watch. In the other, she does and it's broken. In the third, no watch. Just as an example!). The girls in new places, the girls in old places, the girls confronting their futures, especially CHANGED futures, the girls encountering lovers or other unexpected people (what do you mean, I married Jimmy from kindergarten?!, that hadn't happened before!). If you want to take a heavily approach: does knowing the future mean you can change it? 

On another tack, I really like the line \"If your friends aren't made of dreams, they're probably already dead.\" We know the iBrain device gives people nightmares. There's a lot of dreaming and what is or isn't real that gets played with. Exploring anything with dreams in that vein would be fantastic. Feel free to make it as surrealistic or as logical as you'd like. There are no rules in dreams.

Saga (Comics) 
Petrichor (Saga)

Felicia Day likes Saga and I like her, so I like Saga (basically). I've been a fan of Petrichor from the very start. I love how she's not afraid to speak her mind, even if she's in a terrible place to be doing so. She's got this devil-may-care attitude and she gives zero shits about it. She even does this to Hazel a few times, but she tones it down for the kid. She's dead loyal to the kid and would sacrifice herself for her. Despite that, she's never as strong as she seems, and she had that moment of weakness. I really just want Petrichor to be happy, I'm certain Vaughn will kill her off in some spectacular sacrificial way and I'm dreading getting to that point. Before we get there - happy! I just want Petrichor to finally have some happiness, however it comes. Whether that's with the Prince or someone else, please just give Petrichor a happy ending. If she has to leave the ship to settle on some distant world where nobody will bother her, SO BE IT. No backstory, or pre-series, no tragedy, no untimely deaths, no bad guys. Just happiness. 

I read this serially, so incorporate anything current (unless it's her death and then just pretend whatever events led up to it never happened).

Kino no Tabi | Kino's Journey (2003 Anime) 
Kino (Kino no Tabi (Anime))

Kino's Journey is really something else.  The story of a wanderer and a motorrad, experiencing a life of freedom while witnessing other's stories.  And sometimes being the only ones left to remember them.  Anything from a standard visit through a Country and its local practices and idiosyncrasies like in the anime, to introspection on the road, to what it means to be a traveler.  Anything that captures the beauty of the Journey.

Final Fantasy Tactics 
Agrias Oaks, Mustadio Bunansa

So I love Agrias.  I love her a lot.  I ship her with Mustadio.  Damn fond of him, too.  You don't have to, of course - whether it be friends, comrades in arms, or romantic, I'd love some interaction together between them.  Anything building on them together through the events of the game, or whatever came after.  Downtime in the camps between battlefields, a quiet moment of friendship (or more), a battle gone awry, life (or death) in exile.  Clashes of ideologies between backgrounds, tradition, progress, technology.  Really, I'm good with any direction you want to go.  And for the record, I also love Agrias and Ovelia (romantic, friendship, fealty) and would take anything involving them, if you prefer.

Saints Row 
Female Boss (Saints Row), Johnny Gat

For being two crazy off the wall partners in crime, I love the depth these two share with one another.  And sometimes only one another.  Whether you write them as platonic best friends in murder crime or take the scenic romantic route, the history is there, and it's amazing.  You don't have to include her, but I also love Aisha, and how she and Gat love each other (to many, many faults), and how she and the Boss get along (especially playing a female Boss, their friendship might not be front and center, but comes across as so beautifully strong in the games.)  I wouldn't object to mutual OT3 shenanigans, if you were open to.  But yeah, the Boss and Johnny: on the job spilling blood and raising hell, quiet(er) hours between friends, patching up wounds, kissing, platonic hugging, slugging it out, anything you want to throw at me.  And let me note, I love custom characters: don't be afraid to show me *your* Boss, and her relationship with Gat, however it may play out.  (Please note: as I haven't played Agents of Mayhem, I'd rather you stick to the original Saints Row universe/continuity as it were.)

Black Closet (Video Game) 
Elsa Gabrielle Jackson (Black Closet), Asami Yvonne \"Vonne\" Ito (Black Closet)

Okay so first off I love this game. A lot. I love how you can play Elsa as anything from ruthless but moral to outright Machiavellian. I love how it’s so gay. I love all the cases and wish the game had even more of them.   

I ship Elsa with pretty much everyone other than Althea but Elsa/Vonne is definitely my favorite route and that’s why I chose to request these two characters. One of the appeals of Elsa/Vonne is Vonne’s loyalty to Elsa; I’ve shipped villain/right hand (wo)man ships forever and even though Elsa isn’t really a villain they kind of have a similar dynamic. My Elsa/Vonne playthrough had Vonne as the traitor and that crisis just made her later loyalty feel even stronger. That girl would kill for Elsa - or perhaps help her dispose of the body. They have such a strong bond with so much history and it kills me in a good way how Vonne has been pining for Elsa all this time and Elsa just hasn’t noticed (and also hasn’t realized that she feels the same way).

Possible ideas for a story:

    *The school is haunted! A ghost has been sighted roaming the corridors in the middle of the night and it’s up to the student council to deal with it. Of course this is a great opportunity for Elsa and Vonne to bond. Up to you whether or not there really is a ghost or if there’s a more mundane explanation.
*Smut. Have Vonne call Elsa “Captain” in bed. Have them have sex when sneaking into someone’s room or during stake outs (I know Elsa doesn’t normally go on those but she wants to hang out with Vonne). Have Elsa bend Vonne over her desk. Have Vonne bend Elsa over that desk - role reversal can be hot too and maybe Elsa likes being the one not in charge every once in a while.
*We saw Elsa and Vonne get together in the game, but what if it had happened differently? I love the moment when a relationship really turns into a romance, so I’d love to see it happening again in an alternate way.
*Hurt/comfort with Vonne comforting Elsa. Elsa is usually so cool and collected, when she falls apart for once Vonne is there to comfort her (and make sure that nobody else has to find out about it because Vonne is the only one Elsa feels comfortable being vulnerable around).

Dòu Máah Dáan | Peking Opera Blues (1986) 
Bàahk Nāu | 白妞 | Bai Niu, Cou Wan | Tsao Wan

This movie is such a gem. Crossdressing, wacky hijinks, a beautiful soundtrack, what’s not to love? I’m especially fond of every scene Tsao Wan shares with Bai Niu or Sheung Hung. While I would be more than happy with gen, I ship Tsao Wan/Bai Niu quite a lot. That one scene, where Tsao Wan comforts Bai Niu outside the theater and it starts snowing while beautiful music is playing, was incredibly romantic to me. (Please don’t pair either of them with any of the men.)

Possible ideas for a story:

    *The scene I mentioned above as very romantic eventually concludes with Sheung Hung getting kicked out of the theater and all three of them going to Tsao Wan’s place to warm up and drink. What if things happened a bit differently and Tsao Wan and Bai Niu ended up drinking together just the two of them?
*Tsao Wan’s wounds from the whipping looked pretty gruesome. I’d love some h/c with Bai Niu tending to them. If you want to, feel free to have Sheung Hung helping as well.
*Reunion fic! How do all the characters meet up again?
*Tsao Wan gets disillusioned with politics and temporarily joins Bai Niu’s theatre company. Hijinks ensue.

    (A brief note on the names and romanizations: There are a number of ways to romanize the names of these characters, and there are some differences between the Cantonese/Mandarin versions. For clarity’s sake I’ve used ones that AO3 uses, but if you want to use a different spelling feel free, I won’t be confused. I’d prefer if you didn’t call Bai Niu “Pat Neil” though, I’ve never understood why some subtitles call her that…)

Wheel of Time - Robert Jordan 
Rand al'Thor, Asmodean (Wheel of Time)

The Wheel of Time is one of those nostalgic book series that I first read when I was very young and that I find myself returning to regularly. I’ve never quite gotten over Asmodean getting killed off so offhandedly in Fires of Heaven. His and Rand’s interactions were my some of my favourite, and I adored the whole set up of him teaming up with Rand and becoming this morally grey mentor figure for a short while. So, I want fixit fic! I ship Asmodean/Rand a lot but would be totally happy with gen too, their dynamic’s interesting no matter what. Please don’t pair Asmodean together with anyone else though (mentions of Rand’s canonical romantic entanglements are fine, as long as they’re not the focus) . Feel free to diverge wildly from the canon from the point of when Asmodean’s death happens in the books, you don’t need to fit it into later canon!

    Possible ideas for a story:

    *Someone finds out Asmodean’s true identity. What’s the fallout?
*Hurt/comfort, up to you who’s comforting whom.
*Rand doubts Asmodean’s loyalty, and Asmodean is having an identity crisis.
*Outsider POV: how do Rand and Asmodean appear to others? Alternatively, Rand tries to explain his relationship with Asmodean to someone else in a way that won’t make them think that he’s going completely mad.
*Rand has to repeat the day Asmodean dies over and over again until he gets it right, Groundhog Day style. I’m ridiculously fond of time loops as a trope!

The Magnus Archives (Podcast) 

no death fic, hopeful ending preferred

Otherwise feel free to go wild, for the Magnus Archives I'd read basically anything and am very non-judgemental. That fluff fic idea that you have stuck in your head but think is too sweet for this fandom? Gimme! That odd kink fic you always wanted to write? Throw it at me! That one crack fic laying dormant in your mind for months? Yes, please! That one ship you think no one else ships?  I'm on board! 
Honestly anything is okay. The only thing I'd request is, that even if you go all out dark and angsty, there is still a sliver of hope at the end of the fic, as I suspect we'll have more than enough hopelessness coming our way in canon.
If you could throw a certain angry goth or the spiders in there somewhere I'd be delighted, but you don't have to. I do have a weak spot for all the assistants and any combination thereof, but also for Basira Hussein; Elias is delightfully ruthless/manipulative and I always love to see more of that too (especially if it, say, involved him manipulating Martin). But in the end? Write whatever you like best!

Would actually love to see a story based on Ramses in which he might be of dubious character but ultimately has good intentions, introspection fic would be greatly appreciated as well as an exploration of his and Juno's relationship (but please do not have them be actually related or have Ramses view Juno as a son). Ramses accidentally adopting Yasmin Swifts daughter and complaining all the way that he never wanted a child, would also be delightful, especially if Juno gets roped in as the weird uncle. 
As for Second Citadel I would like to see more about Rilla and her possible dynamic with Lord Arum, without the focus being on their love for Sir Damien.

Lili Zanotto, Sasha Nein, Milla Vodello, Razputin Aquato

While in my heart I will always be a Lili/Raz shipper and you can't go wrong with this, I would like to see something friendship based and especially Lili's interactions with other agents once she is grown up. Or Lili on her way to become the next Grant Head, something she never thought of aiming for as a child, but as an adult decides that this is actually a job for her, despite all the baggage it brings with it and the doubts others might have. Another idea I had rattling around my brain for some time was Lili deciding that the world really doesn't need the Psychonauts anymore and becoming a 'villain'. Basically anything Lili centric would be absolutely great.

I've only watched 3.25 episodes, but I'm in love. In fact, I've edited my sign-up to add it. I'd love to see a story where Catherine mentors and mothers Ann. I love the relationship with her sister Clare and would love to see more of them together, raising Ryan and being there for each other. I also love the relationship with Joyce - would love to see some backstory from back in the day. Or I'd like a crossover that sends Catherine to the US to get training, where she meets Winnie Lopez and Gloria Burgle from Fargo and they start to investigate something suspicious at the hotel. Or something. Back story, front story, contemporary story - I am happy with whatever as long as there is more Catherine. (And, as with other requests, no need to include all selected characters.)

Passengers (2016)

Despite the problematic foundation of their relationship in this movie, I really do love the idea of the movie and all the potential it has. I'm super curious about their lives between the time the movie ends and the others wake up. I'd love to see just some various moments throughout the years.

I also really love AUs for this fandom — what if Aurora was the one who woke up first? What if they both woke up thanks to faulty pods (either at the same time or different)? What if nothing went wrong and they woke up when they were supposed to? Would they meet on the ship or later on the new planet? What would their lives be like?

I also am fine if you want to concentrate on just one of them and perhaps give some backstory. This was a huge decision to make, to give up their lives, so I'd love to know the thought process behind that and what led to it.

Also, I didn't request Arthur or Gus, but I love them both, so feel free to include them. A fic from Arthur's POV could be fun if that's something you'd be interested in.

Salvation (TV) 
Darius Tanz, Grace Barrows

So I'm only about halfway through this (I found it a bit late into the season so I'm still working on finishing it), but omg I ship Darius/Grace so incredibly hard already. Plus I love the whole concept of them having to work together to literally save the world.

I will try to add prompts to my letter when I've finished watching all of it, but I would love any fic about their relationship — canon, canon divergent, missing moments, PWP, anything. Or if you prefer them not as a couple, I'm good with them being friends and just learning to get along.

Feel free to include any of the other characters, too. I also like adventure fics or maybe a fic with another crisis that they all have to work together to avert.

Rough Night (2017) 
Jess (Rough Night 2017)

I was a little worried this movie was going to be a female Weekend at Bernie's, but I actually thought it was really cute, and I really want more. Especially pre-canon. I adore femslash, so college experimentation with Frankie and/or Blair would be fun (or in Australia with Pippa). Or maybe just another girls' weekend without as many crazy hijinks.

I'd also really enjoy a story of their friendship through the years —&nbsp;the good and the bad — from college to even years post-canon. Or I also like Peter, so a fic of Jess and Peter's relationship would be cute too.

This is still one of my very favorite movies. I adore Elle, and I love the understanding she and Vivian come to at the end. I would love a post-canon fic (from the end of the first movie) of the relationship between the two of them. I ship them together but I'm also good with just friendship if that's more your thing. I'd love to see them solving cases together and realizing how much they care for each other. Or maybe it's years later and they meet up again after going their separate ways long before.

Designated Survivor (TV) 
Alex Kirkman, Emily Rhodes, Kimble Hookstraten, Tom Kirkman

I like Tom Kirkman, but more than that I find I like the women who manage his life in various ways, from the wife who never expected this life to the learning-on-the-job staff to Kimble, who clearly knows how all the games are played.  I don't know what I actually want, plotwise, but I would like these women, and others as you like, to play big parts.

What I like about the show is ...okay, it's no West Wing, but some of the same features, like a president driven by ethics surrounded by a complex family of staff that sometimes fuck up, exist.  A president that even HAS ethics is, to me, a thing I miss deeply IRL, so.

(if you are so moved and you want to engineer a scenario where Kirkman et al get advice from Hillary, I am down).

Generally speaking, I like porn, so if you want there to be sex in this story that's fine, but probably these people are not all ACTUALLY in bed together?  But I mean, that could be ones of the arenas in which discussion happens.

So, what if the Orville crew had been successful in staving off the gender-swap operation for Bortus and Klyden's child?  I want the story of Klyden talking to the women of the ship about being women and girls, not necessarily how to mother since as far as I know none of them are mothers, but more how to best foster a girl, like conversations about different girlhoods, because he has a warped idea about what the difference might be.

Generally speaking, I like porn, so if you want there to be sex in this story that's fine, but probably not among all these characters together.

Also, who is Etta without Steve (to be clear, I didn't find her to lack dimension in the first place).  I'm thinking about Etta, who is enormously non-nonsense and effective, and Charlie, who may not see himself as valuable, being the framework in which Diana learns more about how the world of men works.

Generally speaking, I like porn, so if you want there to be sex in this story that's fine (comfort sex could be a thing!) but it's totally fine not to go there, too.

I nominated this because damn, weather, why you gotta, but I also want to say if you're doing this one please avoid cheapening the disasters in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean in general, the parts of the US where wildfires cause so much (arguably ecologically-positive) stress each year, and so on.  But I mean, the Wildfire and Hurricane clans are getting more populous and bigger; the Greenhouse Gas clan is experiencing serious overcrowding, and the Polar Ice Cap clan is fretting about extinction?  Or something else in which these are characters.  You can, of course, add the disruptive Early Locusts, a character I didn't have room for in the nomination, and/or Rising Sea Level, that asshole hotshot Record Heat Wave, Ice Age, or anyone else that seems like zie deserves a cameo.

Generally speaking, I like porn, so if you want there to be sex in this story I applaud your spirit as I don't know how that's going to work, but I will read it, especially if it's funny.

Calvin & Hobbes 
Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes), Calvin's Mother (Calvin and Hobbes)

Long ago, before I had kids (who are now adults -- it's been a minute) I knew I wanted my kid to BE Calvin.  Calvin's parents, in the comic which of course is from Calvin's point of view, are portrayed as sort of long-suffering roadblocks to his creativity, and like, as a mom, I KNOW WHY THEY WOULD BE AUGH, but also I have this idea that Calvin's mother (and father, but that's not an offered character here) probably both fostered and loves Calvin's wild ideafountain.  

I'm thinking about for example, maybe this is Calvin's mom talking to his partner (who can be Susie, or can be, like, Jacob or Harumi who moved to town in eighth grade or some other person we haven't met) about what happened when Calvin was 2 that led to him being Like This.  Or, just reflections from her, or her telling him (partnered or not) stories about his toddlerhood when he's dealing with his own kid that is a huge handful (or his kid that is NOTHING like him, that he wants to nurture as she did him.  This could go a lot of ways, but anyway: wherein Calvin's mom is a huge part of who Calvin is.

Generally speaking, I like porn, but maybe not between Calvin and his mom.  Like, Calvin's mom and dad?  Sure.  Calvin and his partner?  Sure.  Calvin and his mom?  Please don't.

The Crown (TV) 
Princess Margaret (The Crown), Peter Townsend (The Crown)

Hello, dear Yuletide Author, 
Thank you for offering to write for The Crown; I’m so excited to read your story!

Initially, I only watched The Crown because my favourite actor will be in series two – I wasn’t expecting to fall in love with it. Despite being British, I've never been a royalist and, before watching the show, had next to no knowledge of the Royal family. The show blew me away with its beautiful sets/costumes/locations and superb acting. But what hooked me was Margaret and Peter’s relationship – I adore them together (I’m also a big Ben Miles fan, so it was nice to see him in uniform!) 

Margaret’s vulnerability fascinates me. She hides it so well and when she broke down to her sister, claiming Peter the only one who can calm, reassure or protect her, it made the moments they spent on screen together so much more meaningful. Peter’s calm opposite to her self-confessed “unhinged” personality is perfect. There’s something lovely about his tenderness with her (the scene where she rests her head on his chest in bed comes to mind) and how head over heels she is. I'm a sucker for love stories and mutual pining so this pairing just does it for me. 

Story ideas/prompts: 
* Last moments (or last night) together, before announcing their break up. (This could be so bittersweet!)
* A country ride together, stolen kisses, away from the eyes of the world in picturesque locations.
* Peter “calming, reassuring and protecting” Margaret.
* ‘5 times’ they kissed in places they shouldn’t!

Smut is appreciated but not required, of course. 

Include any other characters from the show you’d like, but it's Margaret and Peter I'm here for!

PS: Dear Author, if you have good royal knowledge, that’s brilliant. Otherwise, worry not because I don’t and am avoiding research as I don’t want spoilers for series two. Please try not to spoil me too much if futures play a part in your story. 

Thank you, dear Author!

Line of Duty 
Steve Arnott, Ted Hastings

Hello, dear Yuletide Author, 

If this is the fandom you’ve been paired with me for, I’m utterly thrilled! There’s very little Line of Duty fic and that’s a shame because it’s such a wonderful show. Every character has their obvious strengths and flaws, yet they’re all so mysterious. The focus always seems to be on the cases and suspects rather than the main team and that’s one of the main reasons I’m intrigued to read about them. It feels like we know a lot about them but we don’t – the perfect excuse for fic to fill the gaps! 

Superintendent Ted Hastings is one of my all-time favourite characters. Clearly, he’s a man of morals; he always wants to do the right thing. From joining the RUC during the Irish Troubles (as a Catholic – BRAVE!) to seeing his AC-12 cases through to the bitter end (even if it means arresting his superior officers) he’s always on the hunt for justice. But who is Ted, really? The audience rarely see anything but his professional persona. I want more Ted Hastings in my life.  

There’s something fascinating about Steve too. He’s quite arrogant, yet I’m always rooting for him. He’s good at what he does but makes a lot of mistakes, (he's human!) I love seeing him improve as a person, and shaking my fist at him when he refuses to budge. This show piles on the whump for Steve too, and that’s perfect! I like seeing him hurt and I should feel guilty about that but... I only do occasionally. Basically, I’m torn when it comes to Steve Arnott! Protect this boy at all costs, but also give him a slap for being such a \"gobshite\", as Ted calls him. 

Oh, lovely Steve and Ted, the only non-canon pairing in my requests. Dear Author, if you don’t want to write a fic where they’re shipped, I understand, but I want to note that I ship them like burning. I’d be over the moon with any story about them, so if the thought of them boning is not your bag, please don’t feel like you have make it so. 

Story ideas/prompts:
* Missing scene – Ted speaking with Steve in his cell when he pulls an all-nighter to prove he’s not the Caddy. (Potential for super angst if Ted is unsure of Steve’s innocence…)
* Missing scene – Ted in the ambulance with Steve after he’s pushed down the stairs. What happened between then and him being back at the office to question Nick Huntley? Or other visits to see Steve in the hospital.
* Hurt/comfort following Steve whumpage (as he is always getting beaten up, bless him).
* Steve having sudden panic or PTSD-type symptoms once he’s fully recovered from being pushed down the stairs and Ted helping him calm down. (Example: they exit a lift together and Steve freezes at the memory of the attack.)
* Ted gets into serious trouble, gets locked up for a bit and Steve stands up for him/attests his innocence. BROS!
* Case-fic!
* Rescue missions/saving each other (happy for either of them to be the damsel in distress).
* Forced bed sharing, heh.

I'm super happy for Kate, Dot or Lindsay to feature as they’re awesome and I love them a LOT but would prefer the story to be focused on Steve and Ted. Characters who weren’t in the tag set I also love: Maneet, Hilton, Roz, and Danny Waldron.

The Disappearance of Alice Creed (2009) 
Vic (The Disappearance of Alice Creed), Danny (The Disappearance of Alice Creed)

Dear Yuletide Author, 
I’m not expecting any offers for this obscure film so if you’re reading this and thinking of writing something, I'm hugging your ankles already. 

I love the film because it has brilliant characters – amazingly acted too! – and, with that, brilliant backstory potential. We know very little about Danny and Vic, apart from the hints we’re given about where they met. The audience are also left unsure if Danny was playing Vic all along or if he really did love him. I’d love to read anything about them – I absolutely love their relationship dynamic.

Story ideas/prompts:
* Pre-canon, prison setting – first meetings, relationship development, first moves. (Who left prison first? Did they come and visit the other? They clearly waited for each other.)
* Missing scenes. (Example: How did Danny find the strength to escape the forest after he’d been shot?)
* Danny says he fell for a \"mean\" Vic who tells him what to do, who's confident. What about a 5 times story? ‘5 times Vic told Danny what to do and 1 time he didn’t’. 
* Character/relationship study.
* Domesticity – Pre-canon, perhaps. Did they live together? Were they scraping by?
* Planning/fantasising what to do/buy with the kidnap money. (Would they both want the same things, what with their age difference?)

I’m happy for you to go down any route regarding Danny’s feelings for Vic (i.e. he was playing him/loved him all along) but, as seems canon, I’d prefer Vic being a bit smitten with Danny. Feel free to include Alice too, if you’d like, she’s a brilliant character! Danny obviously had a past with her, so it could be interesting to read about that intertwining. 

If you want to get smutty with these two, sign me up! If not, sign me up too! Seriously, I’d love anything about Vic and Danny.

What if someone else finally told Nozaki about Sakura's feelings? (Or an offshoot - a deeper thinking of his relationship with Sakura and what this could lead to?) What if Nozaki decides to help Sakura with a project she has as repayment? (For example, maybe Sakura writes a novel and he gives insight?) Playing an otome game or galge together?

幻城 | Ice Fantasy (TV) 
Ka Suo (Ice Fantasy), Li Luo (Ice Fantasy), Yan Da (Ice Fantasy), Yi Kong Shi (Ice Fantasy)

It's been one year since Ice Fantasy came out, so the perfect time to hunger for more.
Btw, I'd prefer if you ignored Ice Fantasy Destiny, simply because I'm only half-way through and don't expect to finish anytime soon.

I have requested the four that are on the header picture which attracted me to the series. My two ships for this canon are Ka Suo/Li Luo, because I have thing for mortals/immortals. And Yan Da/Yi Kong Shi, because I have thing for Fire and Ice clashing.
Li Luo and Ka Suo in the world of the humans were just so adorable, with Li Luo teaching Ka Suo new things. Whereas Yan Da was trying to thaw the cold fish she took for a mortal. They were nice, too. 

Ideas:
Li Luo and Ka Suo's wedding night (day? due to monster) Li Luo and Ka Suo actually making it to that inn after selling fish.
Li Luo and Yan Da having to work together to save Ka Suo and Yu Fei/Yi Kong Shi
Yi Kong Shi not rejecting Yan Da's kiss. Yan Da falling ill and needing Yu Fei's tender love

DNW: violence worse than canon, unhappy endings, noncon
It's fine to leave requested characters out, I'd just like that at least two of them interact with each other.

If you want to go a more porny route, here are some likes:
'Thank God We're Alive' Sex, Aphrodisiacs, Arranged Marriage, Developing Relationship, Established Relationship, Fertility Festival, First Time, Healing Sex, Sharing a Bed

구가의 서 | Gu Family Book 
Choi Kang-chi, Dam Yeo-wool, Gu Wol-ryung, Yoon Seo-hwa

I have a thing for half-spirits and spirit, so this series was very much right up my ally. Wolyong’s voice also helped a good deal. 

I think Kangchi and Youl made a great team and were a great team. Turning out to be a half-spirit is not an easy thing to take in, especially if you have trouble keeping your spirit side under control, it was nice to see someone accepting him as he was and believing in him, even when he didn't. And his parents are actually what got me into the show. The noble and still apparently rather inexperienced and childish fox spirit and still his later struggle with his inner demon and the past. The young woman viciously cast from a happy life twice, who in the end still chose her love over her revenge.
I loved Kangchi’s tie up scene. Hanging in those chains, suffering from the drug in his demon form, and his mother suffers right along side him.

Ideas:
Youl actually touching Kangchi that first time in the Garden after he found out he's a half spirit.
Wolyong saves Sohwa earlier from the Tree of Shame.
Sohwa and Kangchi get to have some more time as mother and son.
Sohwa survives her stabbing and Wolyong still becomes his old self.
Sohwa, Wolyong and Kangchi get to spend some family time together, maybe with Youl tagging along.
Future fic - Wolyong wakes up again, either with Sohwa somehow come back to life with him or re-incarnated and it's Kangchi's turn  to get fox spirit and Joseon woman settled into modern times, maybe while also having to explain things to Youl.
Either of the two couples exploring what it means to have a half-spirit or full-spirit in bed.

那片星空那片海 | The Starry Night The Starry Sea (TV) 
Shen Luo (The Starry Night The Starry Sea), Wu Julan (The Starry Night The Starry Sea)

To get things out of the way first. So far I'm loving season 2, but since it's still ongoing when signups close, lets ignore it this time around.

The reason I came to this fandom? *cough* Merman!!! in the trailer
Nicely blue and fined Merman! 

I stayed around for the nicely blue and fined Merman and the woman who knew she wanted to tap that tail - even when she didn't know about the tail part yet - and didn't give up on it.

While I have no interest in alternate universe settings, canon divergence is totally fine.

Ideas:
Them coming up with other ways to kiss-without-kissing.
Swimming/diving lessons with merman
Exploring all those fins and blue scales.
Wu Julan caught by an aquarium owner about to be put on display? Shen Luo to the rescue.
A way for both of them to survive.

Novoland: The Castle in the Sky (TV Show) 
Feng Ren (Novoland), Feng Tianyi (Novoland), Yi Fuling (Novoland)

Winged people and a political intrigue. That's the thing the series summary promised, well, it contained those and was completely different on the rest.

I was hooked when Feng Tianyi appeared, there was just something very alluring about and I loved it when he got to be happy together with Fuling. I also loved it when his uncle came into the mix. Feng Ren worked so hard for his nephew even while he nearly had a copy of his wife in his grasp. Their fight over Yi Fuling after she broke Feng Ren's zither can only be described as a cock fight.

Ideas:
How Fuling and the thoroughly wet and cold Tianyi spend the night after their crash.
Fuling and Tianyi actually getting to have some fun and exploration with his new wings.
Tianyi working the whole goddess thing out with Fuling instead of letting her sitting at the altar.
Ren giving Fuling a crash course in wings, since presumably Tianyi would get his own eventually.
Fuling and Tianyi finding out that Ren wanted to give his own wings to Tianyi.
All three being caught in a storm and needing to share warmth for the night.

무림학교 | Moorim School (TV) 
Hwang Moo-song, Chae Yoon

Moorim School which sadly was cut short. I would have wanted to see more of the kids and their teachers. And especially more of Hwang Moo-song and Chae Yoon. Such fine looking man, such good friends. I liked that they even made loving the same woman work and of course that Hwang Moo-song took care of his best friend's daughter.

The special super powers also help.
I loved that in the end Chae Yoon didn't believe his friend had betrayed him and they returned together to Moorim with Chae Yoon supporting the wounded Hwang Moo-song

    Ideas:
    Old friends getting to know each other again.
    Chae Yoon nursing Hwang Moo-song after he is wounded at the end.
    Chae Yoon and Hwang Moo-song sorting out the whole being fathers to the same daughter thing.
    Good use of special powers in bed.

Emelan - Tamora Pierce 
Briar Moss, Trisana Chandler

More details in my letter, but:
- I LOVE the found family aspects of the Emelan series. And obviously I love all four of the circle (and am absolutely happy for the others to show up), but what I'd really love in particular is something about Briar and Tris's relationship, be it platonic or romantic. (If platonic, I'd prefer no one-sided crushes unless they're eventually reciprocated, and nothing where they're involved with other people.)
- Are they kids? Are they adults? Set during the series or after the series? Wild magical adventures or mundane squabbles? I'm here for all of it!
- I would prefer that it be set in-universe, though — usually I'm all here for AUs, but not in this case.

- YMMV on this but I see Bruno 100% as the pining one — although I'm happy to read it the other way around too! But really though, that boy is in love.
- Would love to read about them getting together, but I'm very easy on the how. In school? Future fic where Bruno is the new 30something headmaster of Macdonald Hall and all the students try to set them up? University? AU where they're in SPACE for whatever reason? AU where they're at rival schools? Regency AU? I AM HERE FOR ANY AND ALL OF IT. GO WILD.
- My biggest thing is for the relationship dynamics not to feel too unbalanced. Obviously as a temporary thing it's fine — as we know, sometimes Bruno pulls too hard in one direction and Boots eventually snaps, but one of the things I love about the movies is that most of the time Boots is right there with him — he's rolling his eyes at some of the ridiculous plans, but he's not just getting pulled along, he's an active part of the process.
- THEY'RE SO CODEPENDENT AND IT KILLS ME.

Which is a lot.
- Happy with anything from mundane adventures like them commenting on a book, to weird sky shenanigans. Does one of them get threatened and the other has to save them? Do they meet Byron's sister Rosamund post-There Will Be Phlogiston and have to deal with all the emotions that stirs up? AUs, external pov, and epistolary/fake articles/etc. are all great as well.

Akatsuki no Yona | Yona of the Dawn 
Kija (Akatsuki no Yona), Shin-Ah (Akatsuki no Yona), Jae-Ha (Akatsuki no Yona), Zeno (Akatsuki no Yona)

You don’t have to include all the requested characters on this one.  Focusing on one or two of them is fine.  Feel free to include the rest of the ensemble, too; this really is an “I love everyone in this bar!” fandom for me, and basically everyone other than one-arc villains I like or at least could be interested to read about.  The current dragons are my very favorites, tho, so I’d like a focus on one or more of them.
Maybe pre-canon.  At least in the manga, Kija said he has been outside his village before, maybe show me one of those times.  Maybe let Shin-ah meet someone from outside his village and have some kind of positive interaction with them (fleeting and bittersweet perhaps, but please not tragic).  A time Jae-ha needed a rescue from the other pirates.  Zeno being a stalker (note, I’d prefer that Zeno stories be set during the other main characters’ lifetimes).
Or maybe something after they’ve all met.  Send one or more of them on an adventure.  Or, the relationships are what really make this series, so just pick two of them and play them off each other somehow; every combination is precious with this bunch.  (As a random specific prompt, I’ve thought it could be interesting if Jae-ha hurt his left leg enough to cause mobility problems for a while; could be serious, funny, or both.)
This is also a good series for “What If” AUs.  Maybe a story where one of the dragons left their village under different circumstances — maybe adopted by Zeno or by another canon character.  For a different sort of AU, spillover from this fandom actually got me into historical Kdramas, and after dabbling in those I think an AU set in Joseon Period Korea would be interesting (although it would take someone more knowledgeable than me to do it right).
LIKE: Winter themed stories (for Yuletide time), Good-hearted people, Happy or bittersweet endings, Representation, Competence, Genfic, Thought experiments, Drama, Fluff, Cuddling, Description Porn.
DO NOT WANT: Embarrassment, Rape, Grimdark, Actual Porn.

Bonus points: include a warm, soft, furry animal, not necessarily an Ohjuu.

Kuroorihime to Kawaki no Ou 
Setia (Kuroorihime), Azurite (Kuroorihime)

This is your “gimme,” but I would love to see fic for it — it’s a one-shot manga by the creator of Akatsuki no Yona.  To be totally honest I think it’s kind of messed up (what with the literal nonconsensual bodice-ripping scene and the power imbalance being straightened on the back of a disability and everything, plus me being a huge AkaYona fan and seeing how familiar some of the character designs look adds an extra layer of <i>ennh</i>) — and yet!  I still enjoy this story and still root for this couple, even if I do hope they continue much further on their journey toward, you know, an actually healthy relationship.  So post-canon would be great; show me Setia being a badass queen and Azurite being a more enlightened but still badass king (with a disability).  Maybe let one or both of them learn more about the other’s backstory, or have some feelsy or humorous fluff as they try to navigate this whole relationship thing.  Another option I’d be interested in is a “What If?” AU with a completely redesigned version of Bado, one who’s actually a decent enough guy to complicate rather than simplify the situation and who maybe has an agenda of his own (I still root for Setia and Azurite and would hate to break them up, but a swerve toward OT3 territory would be just fine — something fraught but not doomed, perhaps?).  Bonus points in any case for Setia being awesome.

Computers & Software (Anthropomorphic) 
SarcasticRover (Twitter bot)

So, here's the thing, I'm a technical writer. I write documentation about computers and software. I write requirements documents. I write user documents. I write policies. I write standards. I love, love, love (no for serious) flow diagrams. If you, like me, want to write something crazy sarcastic about the most random user requirements ever, go for it. If you want to write an anthropomorphic Application going, \"What was my developer thinking?\", go for it. Or weeping, why are there no comments in my code to explain what I am for. All too real. I don't need no code review hydras? The error, the lurking error when the stupid human does the stupid human thing, I am down with jumping that shark. I have, I should mention, also done a fair amount of QA. Errors lurk. 

Outside of that, want to write the Sarcastic Rover, love it. Explore Mars. Be sarcastic.

Wolf 359 (Radio) 
Hera (Wolf 359), Renée Minkowski (Wolf 359)

Just give me a story about any/all of the wonderful, complex, and incredible ladies kicking ass and taking names in outer space! I have an extra soft spot for Hera, Minkowski, and Lovelace, but really, anything that puts the spotlight on space-faring women, their lives, and the relationships between them is going to win my heart. Especially if it keeps the canon sense of humor and adventure!

(You can assume I'm caught up with canon, I listen promptly each week, so you can work with the state of things in any season and don't need to avoid spoilers)

For all my requests, my main DNWs are non-con/dub-con, incest, porn without plot (sex is fine as part of a story), violence against animals, explicit medical/body horror (mentions or passing references are fine), and homophobia.

Bartimaeus - Jonathan Stroud 
Bartimaeus (Bartimaeus), Kitty Jones, Nathaniel (Bartimaeus), Ptolemy (Bartimaeus)

Ooh, man. This has been a long-time favorite series of mine, so feel free to play in the world or with the characters in any way you see fit! I especially love heaps of sarcasm, magical adventures, Kitty being a force of nature, Bartimaeus being clever and lucky, and Nathaniel learning lessons the hard way. The original series could have used even more amazing ladies front and center, so if you can fill in those gaps (or focus on the canonical women), please do! Alternately, if you wanna go back in time and play around with the lovely relationship between Bartimaeus and Ptolemy, go ahead!

This is such a rich and intricate world, the history and practice of magic in this series is so dense and beautiful, so please feel free to do whatever you want in it -- characters listed are just suggestions! I love wild and untamed fairy folk, magical journeys, wry wit, and ladies and servants rising above the privileged men around them to recreate their world.

Or how about Diana as a child or a teenager, learning how to be an adult woman in a society that hasn't had to deal with a child growing up in a very long time? Anything to flesh out the world even more. Alternately, I'd love a story about Diana adapting to (and making her mark on) the world outside the island throughout history and up to the present day-- how does she handle major events and shake-ups on a global scale? How does she continue to find the strength -- and the ways -- to do good for people? Either way, I'd love to hear more about these warrior women and their inner lives.

The Amberlough Dossier Series - Lara Elena Donnelly 
Cyril DePaul, Aristide Makricosta

The line that absolutely killed me in the book was \"If Cyril was going to come by conventional means, two weeks was more than enough time. If he was going to arrive via miracle, none of Aristide’s actions would hinder him.\"

The thing I want most is years and cities later, they run into each other and some utterly mundane pop into a coffee shop or standing on a subway platform becomes that miracle.

Alternatively, I would also enjoy something pre-series about how they meet or them being giddy in the early flush of their relationship.

Looking for Group - Alexis Hall 

There are a lot of ways this request could go.

First, more adorable dramatic romantic gestures on the part of Drew and/or Kit. My kingdom of something where they go sit on a rock \"fishing\" and looking at the moon IRL. Adorable romantic gestures would also be good for a 5+1 fic format.

Second, I want Drew to meet all the main characters IRL, because it's easy for him to say he's going to stop caring what people think of him, but a lot harder to do that. Also, these are Kit's friends and he wants Kit's friends to like him. This goes a zillion times more with Drew meeting Jacob.

Third, sort of going off of that, I would love a story about Kit and Jacob's friendship. In the book Kit is pretty well adjusted and even-keeled, but you get a sense that he wasn't, and I want to see a younger, messier Kit meeting Jacob and looking up to this well-adjusted, married, gay gamer. Especially if Jacob looks back at Kit and is a little baffled by the mentor/role-model thing because his life is pretty messy. Jacob was in the US military under DADT, at some point got out, married a guy, had kids, emigrated to Germany, etc.

The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue Series - Mackenzi Lee 
Percy Newton, Henry \"Monty\" Montague

I spent most of this book thinking I was reading a romance novel, and only realized it was YA when I got to the end and there was no sex. If you like writing sex, I would love to read about them finally banging.

Other things: what do they do for jobs? I want this to be realistic for the time period but am too lazy to do the historical research myself. Or does Monty's final letter to his father read like blackmail to his dad, so he keeps supporting them?

Other other thing: The Goblin goes looking for his brother, Monty, years later. Not sure how that falls with the whole Napoleon thing, maybe young British men are no longer going to Europe for a joy ride? Or if the Goblin going to them doesn't make sense, maybe Monty's father dies and the Goblin asks Monty to come home for something related to that. I'm a sucker for stories where well-adjusted adults are called back to the scene of their terrible childhood for ~reasons.

The Borgias (2011) 
Cesare Borgia (The Borgias 2011), Micheletto (The Borgias 2011)

I would adore a Cesare/Micheletto slash story, whether that's G rated or NC-17, and whether it's unresolved sexual tension, or completely resolved and reciprocated. I know the series ends with Micheletto seemingly going his own way, but I've read The Borgia Apocalypse screenplay, and I know Neil Jordan didn't intend for their partnership to end there, and of course, historically speaking, Micheletto was loyal to Cesare to the bitter end, so I'd love a story that takes that into account, whether it's set before, after, or during their break. I would be happy with pretty much anything that explores their relationship some more, whether that's through a plotty adventure/political scheme or something more introspective/vignette-y. I would truly adore something post-series. I'd love to see how the two of them come back together after everything's fallen apart, if that's a thread you want to follow. How does that happen? Have they changed/matured in the time they've been away from each other? Are there hurts left to heal? Do they fall easily back into old patterns, or are there new things they've realized about themselves/each other? Are they angry? Happy? At peace? Or maybe you'd like to write something far beyond fixing what was broken between them. That would also be wonderful, to see them further in the future. How has their alliance stayed the same/changed/strengthened amongst changing fortunes and other people's duplicities?

Or if you'd rather write something during the series (also great), what are they like together when they're at their leisure? What's it like for Micheletto, always in the shadows behind Cesare, forever watching out for him and the Borgia family? How does his loyalty manifest when he's in the middle of some foul task specifically performed for Cesare? (And here I'm thinking about all the torture, murder and violence he does in Cesare's name, but it could be anything! Ex: What did Giuliano della Rovere ask of Micheletto while he was \"undercover\" with the Cardinal? Did Micheletto think about Cesare while carrying out della Rovere's commands? Did Cesare think of Micheletto and all the things he was no doubt enduring in della Rovere's house?) How does Cesare view his stray dog? We see lots of evidence of Micheletto's loyalty to his lord, but how does Cesare's manifest? If you want to go dark, that's ok by me. I find some of the more extreme things the two of them have done (to each other and in service to each other) as fascinating and compelling as they are disturbing.

Crimson Peak (2015) 
Lucille Sharpe, Thomas Sharpe

I would love a story about Thomas and Lucille's twisted relationship, of any rating. I'd love something pre-movie, whether that's about their shared childhood, before they decide to bilk (and murder) the ladies of Europe, or while they're conspiring against (and/or poisoning) one of Thomas' previous wives. I am *all* for the tropes of Gothic Romance, and I'm in love with the movie's landscape and atmosphere, so feel free to go as dark and creepy as you like. Perhaps something about the beginning of Thomas and Lucille's incestuous impulses? When did that happen? What was the cause/catalyst? Was their mother aware that they had decidedly adult desires for their own sibling? Was the abuse the reason that Thomas and Lucille looked to each other for love, or was the incest a convenient excuse to hurt them? Or perhaps something about Thomas becoming aware of the depth of Lucille's madness? When did it first manifest? What drove her to kill? How did he become so accepting? How did they hatch the plan to start conning women into marrying Thomas and then murdering them for their money? What was it like living in that house, either as one of Thomas' fated wives, or as Lucille or Thomas, as these plots spun out? What, if anything, tipped his wives off that they were being poisoned/something was going on between Thomas and his sister? What was it like for Thomas, watching Lucille poison his brides? What was it like for Lucille, watching Thomas play the doting husband (while rebuffing any use of the marital bed), yet still coming to her in private moments to consummate their own union over and over again?

Or maybe you want to write more about the ghost angle? How are Thomas and Lucille haunted by what they've done, if at all? Is one of them more haunted than the other? Are they at all aware of the literal ghosts in their home? Is it more a figurative haunting for one/both of them? There's plenty of room to play with the supernatural (or the psychological), and I'd love to see what you can do with it, if you're so inclined.

Eastern Promises (2007) 
Nikolai Luzhin, Kirill (Eastern Promises)

I'd love a Nikolai/Kirill slashfic of any rating. Perhaps post-movie, in the aftermath of Semyon's arrest, if that interests you? What's happened to the family? Who is in charge now? Has Kirill been punished like his father, or is Nikolai protecting him, and if so, what's motivating him to do so? What is Nikolai's relationship like with the FSB now? What are Nikolai's long-term plans? Do they involve Kirill? Has Kirill managed to gain and maintain Semyon's position of power? Has he become the man his father wanted him to be, or is he a different kind of leader? Or is he a leader at all? Does Nikolai stand at his right hand, or is he the puppeteer behind Kirill's rule? Or perhaps Kirill and Nikolai have moved beyond the family to another life? How did that happen? Did Nikolai bring the rest of the family down as promised, or did he turn his back on his responsibilities when he and Kirill left?

Or if you'd prefer something set at *any* time in the movie's continuity -- pre-, post- or sometime during -- maybe you'd like to explore Nikolai's view of Kirill's relationship with his father? (What does Nikolai think of the way Semyon abuses his son? The way he speaks about him, and raises Nikolai up while pushing Kirill down?) Or Nikolai's view of Kirill's relationship with his family (as individuals or as a business; he seemed very fond of his nieces, and not so terribly great as a business man)? If you'd like to write something more intimate, what about an encounter where Nikolai struggles to balance his cover and his (possible) feelings for Kirill? Kirill, of course, is victim and perpetrator rolled into one, so if you'd prefer to explore how that plays out -- maybe through a story from his point of view, or a scenario in which he now wields power over/is subservient to Nikolai -- that would be great too! I love the idea of Nikolai having complicated feelings towards Kirill, whatever that means for him, so long as he isn't simply using Kirill. Please, no Nikolai/Anna. I'm fine with angst, guilt and ambiguity in this fandom, although none of those are required (and I hold out a hope that Nikolai isn't simply using Kirill).

Request 4 by Galadriel
Killjoys (TV) 
Johnny Jaqobis, Khlyen (Killjoys), Lucy (Killjoys)

For this request, I'd be happy with a John/Lucy story, a John/Khlyen story, or a John/Khlyen/Lucy tale. ...Basically, what I'm saying is I'd love any combination of John with Lucy and/or Khlyen. As with all my requests, I prefer relationship-based stories, and I'm happy with all ratings.

I love everyone in this show, but John is my favourite, and I adore his attachment to Lucy (and vice versa). I would love a story that showcases this relationship with Lucy, and how she favours him over the rest of the crew. Is Lucy \"in love\" with John? Why, and how did that happen? Is it because he is the most invested in her maintenance? Is it because he treats her more like an autonomous being? ...And what about John? How does he *really* feel about Lucy? What kind of bond does he maintain with her? How does he think about her, either before or after their kiss? As a computer? A ship? Or something more? The scene at the end of Season 2, where Lucy tries to prevent John from leaving, nearly broke my heart. What was it like from Lucy's perspective? How might memories of Lucy affect John while he's on the run?

I also love Khlyen. I love how dark and twisted and amoral he is, how detached he is from messy things like emotions and regret, how obscure his motives are for most of his time onscreen, and how he (usually) tolerates the Jaqobis for Dutch's sake. I would love, love, love to see him get his hands on John and -- short of killing or permanently hurting him -- have his way with John. Does he need to physically/psychologically torture John for a particular piece of information? Do they end up trapped alone together, and have to reluctantly work with each other to escape a terrible situation? Does Khlyen simply... abduct John so he can toy with him? There's plenty of room for darkfic and/or some predatory/prey behaviour between the two of them. Maybe John tries to flip the script and get one up on Khlyen? Would that even work? ...If you can work Lucy in as well, I'd be utterly thrilled, whether Khlyen is using her against John (By threatening harm? By altering her program?), or as an asset to get John out of the situation, or as the main \"person\" searching for John, etc.

Given Khlyen's end in Season 2, and his reappearance in the Green at the end of Season 3, I'd also be thrilled to see what you might do with the Green version of Khlyen, if that's something that piques your interest! Do Dutch and Aneela bring him out of the Green? Is he more like the man he was before he became one of the Hullen? How does Johnny react to that version? Or maybe you want to play with Green versions of Khlyen *and* Johnny? If the Green is a repository of memories, what are Dutch's versions of Khlyen and Johnny like?

Cymbeline - Shakespeare 
Imogen (Cymbeline)

Weirdly enough for how obscure it is, Cymbeline is my most favorite Shakespeare play. I would love to see anything that gets more into Imogen's head - what is she thinking as this whole drama plays out? What happens afterwards?

In general I'm more of a gen fan than a ship fan, but I recognize that romance is part of stories already, so have fun. I would prefer no non- or dub-con unless it's relevant to the story and treated very seriously.

Sense8 (TV) 

While I have fun seeing the overarching plot of this series unfold, I love love love the moments where the sensates wander through each others' lives and get to know each other and just hang out and talk. A slice-of-life fic would be a lovely thing to read, I think. What hobbies do they have in common, or find interesting about each other? What quirks? How do those of them who haven't told the people in their lives the truth feel about it? Who do they like visiting best, and why? How do they handle someone dropping by during an inopportune moment? The whole setup just seems so full of possibility.

I’d also be happy with a different ending to the show, Grace and Slink living and continuing to destroy Heart Industries, Grace being furious about all the insane gross things Slink has done.

I do ship them in a polyamorous way, anywhere from pg to nc17, but I’m also quite happy with Gen. I’d like a happy fic, if it follows the end of the last episode, I’d like the rowdy 3 to escape quickly and be safe. I’m mostly just want them hanging out together, so domestic curtain fic (as it were) is great, but if you have a sci-if tropey idea I’d love to read it too.

I’m really hoping you’re a shipper because I’d prefer ship fic (Steve/Nancy/Jonathan) if possible.

The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo (Web Series) 
Caleb Gallo, Billy (Gay and Wondrous Life), Karen (Gay and Wondrous Life)

I would love ship fic, as I really ship the three of them. To me the final episode really lended itself to a polyamourous future, so a fic where Caleb is with both Benicio, and Karen+Billy would be fantastic. Or a missing scene where the sharing the bed actually does go somewhere sexual. Or an AU where Benicio does get deported and a broken-hearted Caleb goes to Billy for comfort. I’d be happy with slice of life fic, or a pwp.

Anne with an E (TV) 
Anne Shirley (Anne with an E), Gilbert Blythe (Anne with an E)

<em>So I've loved Anne (and Gilbert) all my life. I've read the series. I've loved and venerated Megan Follows/Jonathan Crombie as Anne/Gilbert. I've fallen for Mandy Harmon and Tanner Gillman in </em>Green Gables Fables<em>. I didn't know if I would love this adaptation. I do. It's a little overwrought at times, but I can't help but feel that Anne Shirley would love that. In particular, I love how atmospheric it is. Anne and Gilbert have been perfectly casted, and I hope the series lives long enough to see this version of these two fall in love. I love that this adaptation has given a little more nuance to their early relationship: Less of Gilbert admiring Anne from afar; more complexity in both their feelings.</em>

For fic, I'd love to see what happens next with Gilbert. How does his absence affect Anne? What's it like when he returns? Do he and Anne connect or does a misunderstanding slow the growth of their friendship? Does Gilbert stay with family? Or does he perhaps become the Cuthberts' boarder for a period, forcing Anne and Gilbert to forge a friendship… or at least, a truce?

I'm also interested in future!fic: What do this Anne and Gilbert look like when they go to Redmond? What does it look like when Gilbert first falls in love with Anne? What do her feelings look like? I have a fondness for modern AUs, too, if that's something that interests you.

An Ember in the Ashes - Sabaa Tahir 
Helene Aquilla


  <em>I loved Helene from the moment she found Elias in the catacombs. She's competent—a trait I adore in characters—and resilient. I love that she's honest, even blunt at times; and I love that she's loyal, even if she struggles with divided loyalties. So far, her relationships with Elias and Avitas interest me most, but I would love to see more of her with Laia. I would also like to see Helene interact more with the worldbuilding, particularly the jinn and the fey.</em>


For fic, I'd like to see Helene evolving more. If this means interacting with the fey or the jinn, that sounds fantastic to me. War is brewing. Perhaps that takes her to strange borderlands, where the fey have begun encroach? Or maybe Helene must travel somewhere with the Augurs?

I'm most invested in Helene's relationship with Elias. I prefer Helene/Elias to Laia/Elias. But I also love Elias and Helene's friendship—all that history!—so if you prefer them as friends, that's great, too.  I'm also interested in Helene's relationship with Avitas. I'm not sure they could work as a canon romance—he did torture her—but I'm definitely here for fic for it, if that's what you're into.

If you'd like to include Laia, I would actually love to read about Helene and Laia having to travel together and rely on each other to survive. I'm also curious about how Helene and Darin would get along.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Michael (The Good Place)

<em>Definitely my favorite ongoing TV series! For a show that barrels through its plot, </em>The Good Place<em> doesn't skimp on heart or details. I love that this show surprises me week-to-week. I love all of its puns, all of its characters, and all of its twists. The worldbuilding has been so great, and I'm excited to see where the show goes with it. Eleanor toes the line between relatable and terrible, and I never knew how much I needed Ted Danson as a demon.</em>

I mentioned in my intro that I'm open to any rating this year. <em>The Good Place</em> and Eleanor/Michael are a major reason why. I'm open to—no, I'd LOVE—for Eleanor and Michael to develop complex feelings toward each other… But I'm JUST as open to feelings not factoring into it. In particular, I'm interested in fic that isolates Michael and Eleanor from the others, if only for part of the fic. (See letter for prompts and ideas.)

I'm also open to worldbuilding. In the pilot, Michael describes the Good Place as \"the next phase of [Eleanor's] existence in the universe.\" What comes after the Good Place/Bad Place? Are these more like purgatories? What about morality of demons/angels? Obviously, demons torture humans—and most openly enjoy it—but Michael seems to have an objective understanding of just how terrible a person Eleanor was. Are the Good Place/Bad Place temporary for nonhumans as well?

Killjoys (TV) 
Pawter Simms

<em>This series needed only 3½ minutes to steal my heart: Dutch and Johnny's teamwork; their ease with each other; and of course, their wonderful banter. As the universe of </em>Killjoys<em> grew, so did my love for it—for the worldbuilding, for Lucy, for Pree, for Alvis. For Pawter. She came to love Westerly and its people—from princess to martyr.</em>

As for fic, well… One thing I loved about the first season finale was that it seemed like the beginning of something. If I could change anything about season 2—besides Pawter dying, of course—it would be that Westerly managed to rise up more on its own. I speculated once that the Scarbacks would factor into that, and I would love to see Pawter teamed up with the Scarbacks in a canon divergence fic.

Alternatively, I'd just love to see canon divergence fic where Pawter survives season 2. How does she impact the story in season 3? Does she remain on Westerly? Does she officially join forces with the Killjoys? I'm interested in worldbuilding as well, so perhaps Pawter learns more about the Hullen and all of that.

Annie Porter (Speed (1994)), Jack Traven


  <em>It's all about Annie and Jack, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, I love components of the plot, too. (Strangers thrown together in a high-stakes scenario where they can save everyone only if they work together? Yes. Good. Love it.) But Howard Payne bores me to tears. I could've done with less of that and more of Jack and Annie flirting and  bonding and trusting each other.</em>


I'm interested in several possibilities, as far as fic goes. First, of course, what happens after the bus? Does their relationship survive? (I'd like to think it does.) If not, are they able to move on? Or are they drawn back into one another's lives again and again? I'd definitely love to see them thrown into another situation (or two or three) like this one, just to see them working together again.

Alternatively, I think one of my likes would be great for Annie and Jack. For example, Annie, Jack, and an alien invasion? It's like <em>Speed</em> but more apocalypse-y. I really, really love time loops (if requesting <em>The Good Place</em> didn't give that away), so that could be fun. Or maybe Payne survives and escapes, so Annie and Jack get placed in witness protection.

Banlieue 13 (Movies) 

I love these ridiculous movies with every fiber of my being and pretty much any fic you want to write about them would be wonderful. Mission or case fic would be great, pre- or post-canon, with some or all of these characters teaming up to rebuild their neighborhoods into something safer and more just for everyone. Or you could dig into their backstory: How did Leïto earn the ire of the gang leaders in the banlieue, and how did he look out for Lola as she grew? How did Damien earn his reputation as a Parisian supercop? Where on earth did Tao come from and how did she rise to power in her gang? I also ship Damien/Leïto and Tao/Lola and would be thrilled by shipfic for these pairings or for any other combinations of these four characters (except Leïto/Lola - no incest, please). Anything that played around with undercover/disguise tropes would also be incredibly delightful.

Gentleman Bastard Sequence - Scott Lynch 
Maxilan Stragos

I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS GUY. As foolish as Stragos was to think he could out-scam Locke and Jean, I think that he was probably right about the dangers of magic and the need for ordinary humans to harness greater knowledge and skill so they can stand firm against the greater, more mysterious forms of magic that are moving again in the world - particularly in light of some of the things we learned about the Bondsmagi in The Republic of Thieves. I want to know what in the world led him to arrive at this conclusion, because I don't think a person ends up hating magic that much without having encountered it up close and personal, and probably in a pretty dramatic and unpleasant way that would make a great story. Did he tangle with a Bondsmage and lose? Or did he get closer to the Eldren than the average person and reacted with terror and loathing to whatever he saw? I'd love anything that gave me a glimpse into his backstory and the influences or experiences that led him to adopt his rather singular set of beliefs.

Hunter: the Reckoning 

Tell me about your character. No, really! I leave this prompt wide open for you to give a glimpse at the adventures of any Imbued hunter whose adventures might capture your imagination. If you want to write about any of the canonical NPCs from the game fiction, that's awesome, but I am equally happy reading a story about the heroics of a totally original hunter who hears the call of the Messengers and decides to do something about it. Mercy creeds are my favorites (Innocents specifically), and I'm especially drawn to hunters who strive to reconcile with or understand the so-called monsters that surround them. Hunter-monster friendships and romances are of enormous interest to me, whether or not they end happily. More than anything I'd just like to hear the story of one hunter, any hunter, who takes a stand against evil, and how that turns out for them in the end, whether their mission ends with success or tragedy or both. Pretty much the only thing I would NOT want to read about here is a main character who views being a hunter through a fundamentalist Christian/fire and brimstone/Rapture/Book of Revelation type lens. Otherwise, have at it!

Kreia is an endlessly interesting character, and one of my favorite antagonists in any videogame ever. I'd love to read anything that explored her motivations in greater depth, or anything that delved into her very complicated relationship with the Force. A pre-canon story would be great, telling me more about the things she did during her time as Darth Traya - or, if you wanted to write something that took place during canon, her reactions to any of the events of the game or her interactions with other nominated characters. You could even go post-canon, with Kreia lingering on with the Exile as a Force ghost to provide her unique brand of mentorship from beyond the grave. Any story as twisty and philosophical as Kreia is will be just lovely as far as I'm concerned. Darkness is also very welcome here, within the bounds of my stated DNWs.

Psycho-Pass 
Kougami Shinya, Tsunemori Akane

I'm more into the angsty side of the scale, and I love hurt/comfort (with emphasis on the hurt), both physical and psychological. I love concern and protectiveness. In that regard I'm really looking for things that deal with the impact and the fallout of the traumatic events, from acute injuries to guiding each other through dealing with recent or past trauma. I like challenging a character emotionally, mentally, or morally. I'm interested in what comes after and how the characters deal with what happened or what they had to do, the echo and consequences of these events, for one character in particular or for the relationships and relationship dynamics. Recovery in any and all shapes is my favorite thing. I like modern AUs as well as canon divergence that explores the roads not taken, too.

In shippy fic, I love casual intimacy, rocky roads and slow build. I don't need happy endings, but I don't mind them. Smut is great, and I'm good with most kinks as long as they're consensual, except those that involve, say, bodily fluids. And please don't do maledom hetfic, that can be squicky for me.

月刊少女野崎くん | Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 
Kashima Yuu (Gekkan), Hori Masayuki

Hori/Kashima fic! My favorite version of this ship is the one where Kashima is her amazing, confident, princely self who loves her grumpy senpai to death and Hori tries to resist but can’t help but be swept off his feet by her BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. Any kind of fic about these doofs finally getting their acts together and figuring out their feelings and maybe even successfully embarking on a romantic relationship would be amazing! I also love future fic, AUs, basically EVERY kind of setting, I’m not picky in the least. Bonus points if you write from Kashima's POV! Alternatively, if you don't want to write shipfic, Kashima-centric gen fic would also be good. No excessive angst/tragedy, no non-con, no pwp if you can help it, please. More in letter!

Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers 
Mary Wimsey (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers), Charles Parker (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers)

What I would really love this year is something focused on Lady Mary, or on Mary and Charles both.  She's such a fascinating character! And she gets so little screen time, overall!  And Charles is fascinating too, and gets more but still not as much as I want him to.

Some ideas: What was it like for Mary to adjust to life as a policeman's wife, and for Charles to adjust to marrying into the rich aristocracy?  (Sayers just gives us a few quips and a bit about the household budget, but I feel sure there's more to do there!)  Does Mary ever get the detectivin' urge herself, or does she turn her share of the family brains to other pursuits?  She's clearly more like Peter than like Gerald, but she's not just a female carbon copy of him, of course.  If you felt like doing something plotty in which Mary Encounters A Mystery Or Takes On A Cause, I would be thrilled to bits, but I would be just as thrilled by something quieter showing Mary and Charles's daily life.  We see so little of it; even their courtship is really almost entirely offscreen, despite the fact that it happens over the course of a book.

I'd prefer a fic where at least part of the action takes place after their marriage, because that's the time I'm most interested in, but you're more than welcome to involve her younger days too if you want.  Also, I didn't request Peter or Harriet or the Dowager Duchess or any of the rest, but please don't take that as any indication of dislike for any of them!  I love them all.  It's just an indication of where I want the primary focus to be.  Anyone you feel like putting into the fic too as secondary characters, you should feel more than free to toss in.

Power Rangers (2017) 
Trini (Power Rangers 2017), Billy Cranston (Power Rangers 2017), Kimberly Hart (Power Rangers 2017), Zack Taylor (Power Rangers 2017)

Things I love about this glorious nonsense movie include (but are not limited to):

- the amount of glee it takes in everything it's chosen to be
- the respect it gives every one of the kids for their own perspective and struggles; we know they're going to end up a team, but the narrative doesn't blame any of the kids for taking their time about that decision or having conflicted feelings about it
- TEAMWORK
- HAVING FUN WITH SUPERPOWERS

I think my favorite part of all, in a movie full of favorite parts, is the montage of the Rangers using their new powers to... pass notes in class and fight over a piece of doughnut and so forth, and just having FUN with it, together.  If you can capture that, I will love your fic forever. 

Beyond that, I'm honestly up for just about anything!  The Rangers take on more bad guys?  The Rangers just kick around town figuring out what's next and hanging out and secretly being superheroes?  Flash forward to a few years down the line?

A couple of notes: I don't object to any intra-Ranger ships (though please respect Trini's queerness, however you want to play the details of that), but I'm also not especially invested in them.  Feel free to write any combination of Rangers as dating, friends, or anywhere in between.  Also, feel free to focus on a single Ranger or on a smaller subset or on the entire team, as you like, but I'd like at least a background awareness that they are a team now -- and that they have family ties and friends outside, too.

I left Jason off the list because I could only pick four and I felt that his story got told the most in the movie, but I love him too; definitely don't feel you ought to leave him out of the ensemble!

Ernest Shackleton Loves Me - DiPietro 

OH MY GOD THIS RIDICULOUS PLAY.

Okay, I can think of two general fic options here (which are not mutually exclusive):

1) Kat post-canon.  How do things go for her and Alex?  Does she make any more improbable connections (romantic or otherwise) across time and space?  If so, is that when she needs another boost... or is it her turn to inspire and give pep talks to a historical figure?  (Or just someone in her daily life?)  Or both?  (Does Ponce de Leon ever pop out of her oven again?)  The main thing I'd want is for her to remember the lessons that she learned in the course of this play, and for her future to not be relentlessly mundane.  I don't mind if you keep some ambiguity about whether this actually happened or was all just a weirdly vivid sleep dep hallucination/dream, or even decide that it was the latter, but I'd love some amount of the freewheeling wackiness of canon preserved.

2) Sir Ernest Shackleton.  Just how many people struggling with the challenges of life has he given pep talks and life-changing possibly-hallucinatory field trips to, anyway??  I HOPE THE ANSWER IS A LOT.

Both of these prompts are of course rife with crossover potential.  If you feel so inclined, I would be delighted to see either or both of them making connections with other canons!  They've already bridged time and space and mortality; what's a little question of universes or a fourth wall?

The Raven and the Reindeer - T. Kingfisher 
Gerta (The Raven and the Reindeer), Janna (The Raven and the Reindeer), Mousebones (The Raven and the Reindeer)

I loved a lot about The Raven and the Reindeer, but I really wanted the ending to take more time with exploring what comes after all the frantic death-defying struggle.  Let's see Gerta with the herd that is her village!  Let's see Janna adjusting to life there too!  Let's see their relationship in the day-to-day when they have other human beings around and it's not a fierce struggle of an epic quest together, and let's see them figuring out how to make it last in that new context!  Do they, in fact, stay in the village, or come back after they go to the coast, or voyage on, or what?  And what does Mousebones think of all of this, and what does everyone else think of Gerta having picked up a bandit girlfriend and a raven?  There was so much building towards that question of belonging and coming home and balancing how others see you with what you know in the core of yourself, and then we didn't get to see Gerta's own homecoming, or Gerta and Janna in the everyday.  I want more! 

As with my Lord Peter request, any other canonical characters you want to throw in, you're more than welcome to, but it's entirely up to you and the story you want to tell.  (Though I would like to see Gerta's grandmother at least a little, if possible.)

Dear Author,
You rock unknown author person! Thanks so much for writing for me! Yuletide is my favourite time of year~ I love getting random fics and I hope that you'll like writing in my prompts. 

As a general statement I really, really like fluff and happy things. All of my prompts can have comedy and humour elements and I'd really appreciate it if they did. Laughter (and fandom) is what makes life not suck! I love reading about people coming together as families, friendship, being nice to each other and people (and authors) having fun. Animals, pets, people bonding over pets, cooking (but not cooking the pets) and knitting (potentially for pets) are also appreciated plot points.

<b>I AM ALSO A HUGE CROSSOVER/AU JUNKIE. </b> I love seeing how people interpret characters in new ways and novel situations and I would be totally cool if you wanted to add crossover/au elements to ANY of my prompts. I would request that you crossover with another series that I know (feel free to look at my AO3 bookmarks to see), but that would be totally awesome, like WOAH. AUs, magical realism, alternate histories and fourth wall breakage are all totally cool (and brilliant!) as well.

Regarding romance, I am always happier to read about the relationship build up than I am the sex, so I would appreciate it if things stayed in the G&gt;T range (leave space for fandom!Jesus please). I am totally cool if you want to push things higher to allow for adult language/action (maybe even some heavy petting), but I'm really not a fan of PWPs. I would much prefer a fic about the characters hanging out and watching movies than them making a porno (unless it was ridiculously adorable!).

<b>Serious squicks for me are dubcon, non-con, assault, bullying, embarrassment, gaslighting, bestiality, and politics.</b> I am pretty picky about my pairings (I mean who isn't?) so I would ask that if you are thinking about romance and it's not for a pairing that I mentioned, please make it G or open for interpretation.

Regarding character diversity and re-interpretations, heck yeah. LGBQTAI it up. Make up new racial identities. Why not Rule 63? I'm totally open to you playing around with this too.

If I had a magical power it would be summoning; cause then you get a ton of friends with crazy ass magical powers. Not sure if that's useful, but I'll leave that up to you :)
Now for the prompts!

AHHH!! It got accepted! I would love, love additional bottle episodes of our favourite trash lords and their bumbling adventures through the galaxy. I am particularly a HUGE fan of Lyntel and Bacta (&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3) and would love them trying to corral the rest of the Mynock crew into doing something constructive (Like not making awful choices; 'Hi, I'm Leenik *$&amp;^#ing Geelo'/ The card says 'sex.criminal' lady) or maybe them spending a well earned day at the spa with Nemo or waterpark with Tamlin. Or maybe they all have to break into a highschool for reasons!
Inclusion of the Evil!Campaign crew and all side/secondary characters is welcomed as well (with the exception of Jacinto Reth *shudders*)! OMG I'm already so excited!!
Please Gen to T - I'm not a big fan of any of the romance plots getting serious (although Zero/Blue - yeah ok). The Mynock!Family is pretty much my OTP for this series.

As a general statement I really, really like fluff and happy things. All of my prompts can have comedy and humour elements and I'd really appreciate it if they did. Laughter (and fandom) is what makes life not suck! I love reading about people coming together as families, friendship, being nice to each other and people (and authors) having fun. Animals, pets, people bonding over pets, cooking (but not cooking the pets) and knitting (potentially for pets) are also appreciated plot points.

<b>I AM ALSO A HUGE CROSSOVER/AU JUNKIE.</b> I love seeing how people interpret characters in new ways and novel situations and I would be totally cool if you wanted to add crossover/au elements to ANY of my prompts. I would request that you crossover with another series that I know (feel free to look at my AO3 bookmarks to see), but that would be totally awesome, like WOAH. AUs, magical realism, alternate histories and fourth wall breakage are all totally cool (and brilliant!) as well.

Regarding romance, I am always happier to read about the relationship build up than I am the sex, so I would appreciate it if things stayed in the G&gt;T range (leave space for fandom!Jesus please). I am totally cool if you want to push things higher to allow for adult language/action (maybe even some heavy petting), but I'm really not a fan of PWPs. I would much prefer a fic about the characters hanging out and watching movies than them making a porno (unless it was ridiculously adorable!).

<b>Serious squicks for me are dubcon, non-con, assault, bullying, embarrassment, gaslighting, bestiality, and politics.</b> I am pretty picky about my pairings (I mean who isn't?) so I would ask that if you are thinking about romance and it's not for a pairing that I mentioned, please make it G or open for interpretation.

Regarding character diversity and re-interpretations, heck yeah. LGBQTAI it up. Make up new racial identities. Why not Rule 63? I'm totally open to you playing around with this too.

If I had a magical power it would be summoning; cause then you get a ton of friends with crazy ass magical powers. Not sure if that's useful, but I'll leave that up to you :)
Now for the prompts!

I would love fic about the \"day in the life\" insanity that is so often alluded to in this series. I mean Ryan doesn’t just spend his whole down time sitting in his room now with his cat, right? And not just 'cause that's an awful place to hide from Levi. I am a HUGE fan of the creepy adorableness that is Nurse Johns. Really anything with this cast would be much loved. Regarding relatioships, I am particularly partial to Ryan/Akmazian, since whoa, especially if it’s brought about by interference help from nurse Johns or Levi.
I would also be happy to see what life is like for the other people on the ship, I mean – Ryan now has a cat, is there a vet on the station? How do you register an illegal pet so you can take it to the vet? Is there a groomer on board? Is that a lucrative side business that Levi might try to get into?
Please Gen to T, unless it’s Ryan/Akmazian (then it’s all good!).

NOBELESSE
OMG Frankenstein, yes. Just that, YES. I would love fic just dealing with a typical day for Frankenstein at school and trying to balance being the Principal with his various roles supporting Rai (and everyone else). Like, what do the teachers at the school think about the new guards? About the new students? I mean we’ve seen Pedro, but there must be other teachers who work at that school and some of them must know something weird is going on (seriously they all know what's going on).
My preferred characters are M-21, Frankenstein, Rai and Tao, but Shinwoo’s gaggle are also welcome additions.
Gen to T rating is appreciated (no smut please).

Craft Sequence - Max Gladstone 
Caleb Altemoc, The King in Red, Elayne Kevarian

I love the complex relationships between Kopil and Elayne and between Kopil and Caleb--this is an 'or' request rather than an 'and' request, but I'd love to see you write something about any combination of the three of them. What were Elayne and Kopil like, during the God Wars? Does the King in Red ever long to reach out and make amends with Elayne, after he almost loses his city? What kind of relationship does Caleb have with his erstwhile boss, now that he has some measure of independence? (Is it romantic?) Do Elayne and Kopil ever play any active role in the Two Serpents Group--serving on the board, or attempting to influence its major players outside of the office? How does that affect their personal relationships? What kind of friendships can they build, with all they've seen each other do and all of the secrets they've laid bare?

Machineries of Empire Series - Yoon Ha Lee 
Shuos Jedao, Nirai Kujen

I love the idea of Jedao and Kujen as half-unwilling collaborators, trying to plan and execute a revolution through discontinuous lifetimes and intervening wars and the impenetrable maw of the Black Cradle. I love the secrets they have to keep in their collaboration, because each of them is a different kind of madman and can't be trusted with the fate of the Hexarchate. I love the different ways they solve the same problems, the different logical leaps they make and the different intellectual skillsets they bring to the same table. I'd love to see a few glimpses into their revolution, and all of the times when they twitched the strings of empire just a little. (And if you want to write me some ghostsex, I'm here for that, too.)

Kalevala - Elias Lönnrot 
Aino (Kalevala), Kyllikki (Kalevala)

I'd love to see Aino and Kyllikki banding together after the men in their lives betray them, learning magic, becoming skilled in weaving story and song. I'd especially love a quiet shared-space sort of story where the ladies keep a cottage together and go wandering for long periods in the woods, a story where they garden and herd and and find magic herbs and berries and weave and embroider. I'd also love a story where they go on wild journeys and quests (elaborate bride-quests?) like Väinämöinen and Lemminkäinen get to do. (I would not say no to a little revenge against those guys, either.)

The Penumbra Podcast 
Juno Steel, Peter Nureyev

There are so many things I want for these two. I want to see what Peter's been up to after that night when Juno walked out into the Martian night. I want to see the two of them almost connecting in the months that followed, as the election heated up and Juno sank deeper into despair. But I'd also love to see them reconnect, and to see Juno actually reach a mental place where he can accept what Peter offers. I'd love to see them in an alternate universe--what if they were in one of the Penumbra's other settings, like the Second Citadel or the Painted Plains? (What if Peter were a monster of manipulation, a creature with a thousand perfect faces? Or a traincar bandit who came to America fleeing a failed revolution?) But whatever, whoever, and whenever they are, I'd like to see them in love. Even if it's the kind of love that aches like a wound unhealed.

Almost Human

Ok, I'll admit I didn't care for the movie.  But the series holds a special place in my heart: all the reapers reaching out for each other, the blase normality (even in its absurdity) of death.  I'd love any sort of crossover.  Maybe the reapers meet the Buffy crew? Maybe they get involved with the Leverage crew?

But I'd love just something with George and her relationships to the other reapers, how they work together.

Moreover, is there shipping of Will/Warren in that universe? Do they have to deal with intrusive questions about their personal life?  I'm a Will/Warren shipper, but I'd love anything dealing with all of them grown up and superheroing.

Ancient Pompeii Graffiti 

I.7.8 (bar; left of the door); 8162: We two dear men, friends forever, were here.  If you want to know our names, they are Gaius and Aulus.

I first came across this website a few years ago and this is one that has stuck with me ever since. It's a simple couplet but I get such a bittersweet and melancholy feeling from it. Two voices crying out from antiquity: We were here! We lived! Remember us! Remember!

Were they just friends? Lovers? Did they grow up together? Or did they meet for the first time the night the graffiti was written? Did they die when Pompeii was destroyed? Did they die together? Did they find each other again in the afterlife? Tell me all about these two dear men and their lives that were so intimately intertwined.

III.5.1 (House of Pascius Hermes; left of the door); 7716: To the one defecating here.  Beware of the curse.  If you look down on this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy.

Boy do I have questions about this one. Was Pascius Hermes the one who placed the curse? Did he pay someone else to do it? What exactly does the curse entail? What does it mean to have an Angry Jupiter for an enemy? Is Jupiter angry for being called upon to curse someone for such a stupid thing? Is there more than one Cursed Defector? Do they have a club or support group or something? How does one who has been cursed go about lifting the curse? What are the paths to atonement? Or are they stuck with this curse for life? Feel free to make this as funny or as tragic as you like.

Big Wolf on Campus 
Merton Dingle, Tommy Dawkins

I have such fond memories of watching this ridiculous show after school. It was always such campy fun (also, I maybe had a huge crush on Merton).
I'd love to see something set either immediately following the end of the series when Tommy and Merton are roommates at collage or something set current day checking in with them 15 years later. If set during college you could explore Tommy's difficulty being a werewolf and going to college or how Tommy and Merton's friendship may change now that they're out of high school. Or if set present day them feeling kinda old running around fighting monsters in their 30s. 
I'm hoping for light, funny, story with friendship or romance. If you wanted to go romance smut is fine. Bonus points if you throw in the “The movie! What happened in the movie?” running gag.

IT (2017) 
Stanley Uris (It (2017))

I'd really be happy with any kind of Stanley character study. Maybe an exploration of his fear of the painting in his father's office. Or a focus on the coming of age aspect of the movie centered on him. Or more about his friendship with any or all the other losers. Anything, just give him time to shine. It can be set pre-movie or post movie. If you're interested in writing about 27 years later I'd love a story about adult Stanley (if you’re familiar with the book perhaps a story where he makes different decisions).

My Fair Lady (1964) 
Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady (1964)), Eliza Doolittle (My Fair Lady (1964)), Hugh Pickering (My Fair Lady (1964))

I think these three ended up with such an interesting relationship by the end of the movie and I’d love to see a post movie fic exploring that. Especially with a focus on how scandalous it is for a single lady to be living with two bachelors of no relation. (I’ve always loved Colonel Pickering on the phone with Scotland Yard being unable to explain his relationship with Eliza).
I’m not so much interested in a romantic relationship between Eliza and Henry but I’d love to see if Eliza can ever get these two to treat her as an equal. What becomes of them? (If you want to write romance I’m fine with Higgins/Pickering considering their meet cute or Eliza actually marrying Freddy).
I like happy or hopeful endings, found family and people agonizing over their relationships and their place in the world.

I’d really like a story about Edith – her life and experiences were just as interesting as Clive and Theo’s, but we mostly just see her from Clive’s perspective at the beginning and second-hand from Theo later on. Does she marry Theo so she can stay in Germany, because she really likes him or because she doesn’t want to be waiting forever to see if Clive says anything – or a bit of all three? And does she ever regret it? An AU where she survives into the WWII section could be interesting – would she feel as out-of-place in the modern world as Clive and Theo do or would she prefer it once women had more freedom and opportunities? Alternatively, a story where Clive and Theo meet again earlier in WWI would also be good – how would the war situation affect their relationship when it’s not clear who’s going to win yet? Hard to get Edith into that one in person but some mention of how she’s doing and what she thinks of the situation would be enough.

A Canterbury Tale (1944) 
Thomas Colpeper (A Canterbury Tale), Sgt Bob Johnson (A Canterbury Tale), Peter Gibbs (A Canterbury Tale), Alison Smith (A Canterbury Tale)

I like the almost mystical relationship the characters have with the countryside and its history in this film. If you’d like to try taking the supernatural hints a bit further, something where one of the characters sees or hears something from the past or has an encounter with someone from the past – maybe a crossover with the actual Canterbury Tales, or with a real-life figure from that time? I’d also really like a story set much later, when the war itself has become history – if one or more of the characters came back to the same part of Kent, how would they feel about it? I like all four characters equally so any one or any combination of them would be good – I do particularly like the friendship between Bob and Alison and the odd parallels and contrasts between Peter and Colpeper. Alternatively, I’d be interested in how Colpeper and Alison get on after Bob and Peter have left—do they become friends?

Back Home - Michelle Magorian 
Virginia \"Rusty\" Dickinson

What I like most about Rusty in this book is the way she sticks to her own values but at the same time learns to understand better how the British characters’ experiences give them a different point-of-view, especially in her relationship with her mother. If one or more of her American family visited her in England, how would they find she had changed? If she went back to America later on, what might seem different to her? I’d also enjoy anything focused on her relationship with her mother – perhaps working together on the house after they’ve moved back to Devon. Alternatively, a story about how she settled in with the Omsks when she was first evacuated would be interesting, either from her perspective or one of the older Omsks’ – it must have been just as big an adjustment as the move back to England, even if she forgot about it later.

Aubrey-Maturin Series - Patrick O'Brian 
Stephen Maturin (Aubrey-Maturin - O'Brian), Jack Aubrey (Aubrey-Maturin - O'Brian)

Hello lovely Yuletide writer!

I finished the series this year, and what I really want is just the chance to spend some more time with the characters! Any straight-up fluff and light adventure will make me really happy. If you haven't yet got to the end of reading the books yourself, write me a fun adventure in which Jack and Stephen are Best Friends and I'll be happy. I don't ship them, but I am super into a little non-romantic hurt-comfort. Stephen being rescued by Jack, when he has lost all hope, would be ace!

But what I really want is the chance to see what happens next in the story: I want to see Stephen go home and see a Christine who has changed her mind, maybe even see how they negotiate early married life together (though only if this is done with utmost respect for Christine's suffering in this respect - if they never have sex and just get married, that's fine by me. If they slowly manage to learn to be intimate, also fine. I absolutely don't want to see Stephen forcing or coercing her in any way). Stephen has excellent social skills, and a lot of love and respect for Christine. How does he bring these to bear in helping her to feel comfortable and safe?

I'd also like to see Jack reconnect with Sophie, and adjust to life as an Admiral. He'll wear the power well, but does he miss the adventure? The life of an admiral involves a lot of admin. What is he like when the greatest ambition of his life has been realised? Contented? Calmer? How does he connect with his children, who are presumably now approaching their teens?

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price

I have always found this book the hardest to love out of all the Austens, and it's because I never really felt I could connect with Fanny.

But you have chosen this as one of the fics you can write, so I'm betting you love it. I want you to show me what I've missed - what there is to love in Fanny Price.

I'd particularly like to see how she functions as a married woman, how her marriage works and how she copes with running a household. Does she come into her own a bit, with a more secure and stable homelife, and someone who loves her? I want this to be a happy ending, but I've always struggled to see how it plays out happily, so please show me!

Note: please use whichever characters you like - I just couldn't find any others on the drop down menu.

Northanger Abbey - Jane Austen 
Catherine Morland, Henry Tilney

So, although I love Henry, I've always found something just a shade troubling in his relationship with Catherine. He occasionally makes jokes that go over her head, and doesn't feel the need to include her in them, and he has so much more knowledge and experience that their relationship seemed a little unbalanced. 

I ship it, because he's funny and smart and warm, and their love for each other is absolutely sincere, but I'd like to see what their relationship looks like when Catherine has had chance to grow up a bit, and their marriage is a little more equal. I reckon it would be a great marriage about ten years down the line - I think Henry would slip from affection to affectionate respect very easily.

So! Maybe a fun, faux-gothic adventure where the two of them, now an established married couple, get to go and uncover a mystery together? We get to see how their dynamic works when it's a bit more balanced, but still just as fun and loving? We get to see the woman Catherine grows up to be?

Sonogi Yukina (Senkou no Night Raid), Miyoshi Aoi (Senkou no Night Raid), Kagiya Natsume (Senkou no Night Raid), Iha Kazura (Senkou no Night Raid)

This series has so many concepts to explore and yet leaves so much open and unexplained that I'd be happy to see just about any fic idea for it. Why do the characters have such specific limitations on their superpowers (e.g., Aoi's extremely restricted time of usage; Kazura's visual requirement for teleportation, Natsume's moon-influenced clairvoyance), and how have they trained to compensate for them? How did Yukina and Natsume's relationship develop from mistress-and-servant to working colleagues (and the nearest that either of them have to family, by the end of the series)? How did Sakurai track all of them down in the first place? Or if you want to go counterfactual, what would've happened if Yukina was the one to be swayed by her brother's argument, rather than Kazura? If none of these ideas work for you, I'd be happy to see scenes from individual episodes explored in more detail, or pre-canon/post-canon extrapolation about any of the four main characters.

Mouretsu Pirates | Bodacious Space Pirates

Marika has a lot on her shoulders as the captain of the Bentenmaru, so I'd be interested in seeing your take on her relationships with other characters of your choosing, especially in the ways that they help her out without her knowing about it. How much does she trust them to support her? What would happen if one of them got hurt during a pirating job, or some shady character tried to violate the agreement that protects Marika while she's underage? For that matter, how would Marika step in to protect her friends if anyone of them were falsely accused of a crime, or ran into some other kind of trouble? If none of these ideas work, I'd be happy to see missing scenes from just about any point pre-canon, during canon, or even post-canon. (I've seen the Abyss of Hyperspace movie, so something set during it would be great as well.) I'm fine with Marika/Chiaki (and definitely ship Jenny/Lynn), but shipping isn't a requirement for me in this story!

Fio and Gina are clearly the best characters in a film full of already amazing characters, and I would like ALL the post-canon fic about them staying in touch throughout the 1930s and 1940s and beyond. Does Gina act as a secret messenger/transmitter for the anti-fascist Italian resistance, or hide escaping prisoners or refugees? How does Fio end up taking over her grandfather's business, especially if it's in the middle of wartime? Do either of them still correspond with Donald Curtis? Does Gina ever hear from Marco, even if Fio doesn't? What is the Hotel Adriatico like in the early 1950s? Even if you don't want to go too far into World War II intrigue, just the two of them spending time together during a long warm Adriatic summer would be lovely.

Taihei and Keaton and Yuriko having a meal and chatting about family, Yuriko and Daniel having to work together track down a lead or fend off a threat to Keaton while he's off at a teaching gig, Taihei embarrassing his son by telling Yuriko tales of Keaton's childhood, Keaton trying to teach Yuriko one of the survival techniques he picked up in the SAS...I'm open to receiving just any fic for this canon as long as it stays close to the feel of the series.

The Order of the Stick 
Belkar Bitterleaf, Vaarsuvius (Order of the Stick)

Oh my god, Belkar and Vaarsuvius. One of my favorite hateships/rivalships I've ever seen in media. That said, I'm fine whether you want to keep it gen or go Bel/Vaar. The one thing I <em>don't</em> want is for them to be super fluffy and lovey-dovey together. Other than that, you're good. Hatred, snark, bickering, spite, grudging respect, snarky friendship, bickering lovers, outright hatesex... all of those get the thumbs up from me!

Anything with humor would be great - bring on the pranks, the snarkfest! Alternatively, you could go for some snarky/bickering-filled hurt/comfort. Or there's always good old-fashioned hatesex. In any case: the more bickering, the better!

Genderqueer/androgynous Vaarsuvius highly preferred; gender-neutral pronouns (they, ze, or even just V) also highly preferred.

Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri

Firstly, I'm flexible regarding how you choose to write Santiago and Deirdre's relationship; they could be friends, lovers, friendly rivals, rivals/enemies who deeply respect each other, rivals who find each other aggravating but also attractive (kismesissitude, if you happen to be a filthy Homestuck like me.) I'd prefer if they didn't just straight-up hate each other, unless you're going the hatesex route, &amp; even then it'd be nice if they held some sort of grudging respect.

Here are some things you could explore: how Deirdre and Santiago learned to tolerate each others' ideological differences (for the sake of an alliance, maybe? Or for the sake of a relationship? Or both? Up to you!) 

Something about the both of them having Planetdreams together, perhaps? Or maybe something about how they are both functionally immortal, and how over the decades and centuries they grow closer together, as a result of having few others to connect with who understand the heavy responsibilities associated with leading a faction?

Diana Winthrop series - Kate Chambers 

BACKGROUND: The Winthrop books are a teen-sleuth series (six slim paperbacks from the mid-'80s) set mostly in New York and New England, with \"Kate Chambers\" being a pen name for versatile writer Norma Johnston -- a fact I didn't learn till much later.  The individual mysteries are dedicated to (and often cleverly plotted in the style of) various classic and then-famous mystery authors, the characterizations are much more nuanced than is usual for this category, and there’s a strong ongoing ensemble cast (including a major and well-rendered secondary character who’s blind).

NOTES: If you are one of the other eleven people who read these books back in the day, you know their niftiness and recognize the characters. If you're not, I recommend the series highly even if it is incredibly obscure.  As the prompts indicate, if – beyond all odds – you do know the fandom, I would not be opposed to romance either between Diana and Brad or her father and Lydian (there being definite canonical hints of the latter in later books).  Alternately, a story expanding on the mentor/student relationship between Diana and Lydian would be welcome, too.

PROMPTS: This is one of my nano-fandoms and my Oliver Twist request -- which is to say, what I'm looking for is simply \"more\". Give me either casefic or a character moment for Diana and Brad, give me back story for Lydian (or build forward on what canon gives us of the relationship between Lydian, Diana's father, and Diana), give me a 20-years-later extrapolation...any of these will find me a very happy camper. 

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Given that these were set largely in New York (especially since one of the characters is an actual TV news professional), I’d think there’d be a lot of crossover potential for this fandom.  I myself Easter-Egged a much older Diana into one of my Castle stories some while back, but a Gargoyles, MCU, or Young Wizards cross (for instance) would also be entirely plausible.  For this purpose, see (1) my works and gifts received on AO3, and (2) all entries tagged “Dear Santa” in my  DW journal, and assume that any fandom represented therein is welcome.

Gargoyles (TV) 
Demona (Gargoyles), Elisa Maza, Macbeth (Gargoyles), Titania | Anastasia Renard

NOTES: I own the first two seasons on disc, but (like most) ignore the “Goliath Chronicles” episodes.  Sadly, I have read almost none of the published comics, but have consulted the major online wikis and timelines thoroughly enough in the course of writing my own fics that I’m broadly familiar with much of the post-canon-but-Weisman-canonical storyline.

I would strongly prefer a story featuring any two (or more) of the requested characters, but a story focused on any one character is sufficient to fill this request.  Also, feel free to include characters not in the tag set as appropriate for plot and story purposes.

PROMPTS: I didn’t nominate Gargoyles this year, but I’m intrigued by the inclusion of Titania/Anastasia on the character list.  In that light, I would be particularly fascinated by a story featuring Macbeth and Anastasia – presumably this would need to be either pre-series or offscreen-during-series, perhaps during the “World Tour” arc.  (It seems likely that she’d either know of Macbeth or be able to ID his semi-magical nature, but he would not realize her faerie identity. And now that I think of it, was Macbeth actually around to see that revelation?)  Alternately, we saw so little of Macbeth and Elisa together onscreen that I’d also be fascinated by a story in which they’re drawn together, perhaps because both have been strongly committed to law and justice (if at very different times in their respective lives).  One presumes that any encounter between Demona and Anastasia would lead to fireworks, although canonically I don’t think Demona can find out about the dual identity earlier than everyone else does.  And of course Demona and Elisa have their own ongoing rivalry, which would be highly amusing to look at sometime when Goliath is not actually in the middle of it.  (Note that in these last two cases especially, Demona’s “Dominique Destine” identity may be useful.)

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Have I mentioned lately that I’m a sucker for the well-executed crossover?  And that New York is just full of likely prospects (MCU, Young Wizards, Castle, etc.)?  I am thinking particularly of the mischief Elisa and Kate Beckett might get into together, what might happen if Macbeth and any of the Avengers were to cross paths, Black Widow and Demona facing off for some reason, or how “Anastasia Renard” might be drawn into the orbits of either Carl &amp; Tom or Nita &amp; Kit.  Or, now that I think of it, what Anastasia might make of the YW “Alien Study Group” team.

The Ice Ghosts Mystery - Jane Louise Curry 

BACKGROUND: This was a one-off mystery thriller for young readers (this being before “middle grade” and “YA” were categories) published back in 1972, which might best be described as a sort of L’Engle/Trixie Belden fusion (L’Engle for the science-fictional elements, which are clearly in the same neighborhood as Arm of the Starfish and Young Unicorns; Belden for the cheerfully determined family-of-sleuths dynamic).  Curry is better (but not nearly well enough) known for a wide range of children’s fantasy, and I kept hoping for a sequel to this that never arrived.  Curry has been gradually bringing her backlist out in Kindle editions, and at one point this was available that way; I’m not clear on whether it still is.  If not, it’s findable – and a quick read – via the usual used channels and possibly still in larger and/or kid-friendlier libraries.)

PROMPTS: This book is such an ensemble piece that I've not tried to pick among the available characters.  Just give me a solid \"further adventures\" story -- whether of foiling another Evil Science Plot, coping with school/academic politics, or simply wreaking cheerful familial havoc on some unsuspecting foreign metropolis.  Romance between Oriole and Gabriel is definitely on the table, too – or, perhaps, more ordinary correspondence in which Oriole snarks about the mischief her younger siblings are getting into.

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Yet again, my crossover bias rears its head.  As I note above, I feel a resonance between Curry’s Bird family and L’Engle’s Austin and/or O’Keefe clans – and I have to wonder at what sort of scientific conference (or in the context of what mad-scientific scheme) the Birds and L’Engle’s characters might actually meet one another.

Young Wizards - Diane Duane 
Carmela Rodriguez, Dairine Callahan

NOTES: I am fully conversant with both the “classic” and New Millennium timelines (and happy to receive fic set on either or both sides of that line), and have read all the canonical material *except* THE BIG MEOW and the second ON ORDEAL compilation (although I expect to have the latter finished by the time reveals roll around).  

I would strongly prefer a story featuring both characters, but a story featuring either one will fill this request.

PROMPTS: I chose Carmela and Dairine both because I like them individually and because canon gives us so very little that puts them together with one another -- which I find surprising, even granting the age difference.  I would very much like to see how they interact given an excuse and/or opportunity.  Additional characters welcome; suitably brain-bending crossovers totally welcome but emphatically not required.

With WIZARDS IN PLAY out, we have many of the answers we've wanted relative to Dairine and Roshaun, so I'm no longer deeply worried about excessive angst arising from that quarter.  It does occur to me that Dairine might find it easier to talk to Carmela about Roshaun than to have the same conversations with Nita, perhaps especially now that his situation's been resolved.  (Or you could set such a tete-a-tete earlier in canon, while things are still unsettled....)

Other possible tacks: Dairine getting one up on Nita with Carmela’s help, or the girls and the Alien Study Group having an adventure (I’ve seen a fair bit of fic in this line set in the Crossings, not so much here on Earth).  I would also be very much on board for quality father-daughter bonding -- no matter which father/mentor figure(s) is/are involved.

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: If you’ve been reading all the requests in order, you know what’s coming here.  (If not, feel free to skip upstream and come back....)  Young Wizards is by nature a decidedly crossover-friendly fandom; I’ve done just a bit with that myself, and would totally be on board with a crossover here.  To reprise one particular prompt from above: if you’re literate in Gargoyles, I’d be curious to see what might draw Anastasia Renard into the girls’ orbit here (or Macbeth, for that matter, which might lead to some amusing encounters).  And there are any number of other New York-centric fandoms to draw on – if anyone in TV’s Castle is a wizard, it’s probably Alexis, and it abruptly occurs to me that it might explain a lot in the Spider-Man: Homecoming background if Aunt May were a wizard....

Layla Williams, Will Stronghold, Warren Peace

<strong>What I'd absolutely love to see:</strong> late high school or after graduation, especially with established or developing OT3, but mostly the three of them balancing a life together (in whatever permutation), because whether they're all romantic together or not I can't see them being anything other than some variety of <em>unit</em>, at least at that phase of their lives. Maybe the three of them are fighting supercrime together? Or Will and Warren are superheroes and Layla's off doing her own thing and that's causing tension, or Will and Warren think it's causing tension and Layla's all, \"WTF, no, guys, we talked about this, I'm fine, seriously,\" or just. Anything. With them. Being them. Prom! Exams! OH MY GOD SENIOR YEAR FINAL EXAMS AT SKY HIGH WOULD BE HILARIOUS. And probably deadly. So that'd be awesome, too.

Emelan - Tamora Pierce 
Daja Kisubo, Briar Moss

<strong>What I'd absolutely love to see:</strong> something involving Briar and Daja's sibling relationship, especially with how they both have 'earth' related magic that is, in practice, drastically, drastically different. I'd also love to see something with these two and different parts of their family: the quartet being domestic in their house in Emelan, after Will of the Empress, or Briar and Daja with Lark and Rosethorn, talking over the table late at night in Discipline (visiting? before everyone goes on their journeys? IDK, maybe after everyone's back would be better). Daja is canonically a lesbian, and Briar is word-of-god non-straight (I'll have links to the relevant tumblr asks in my letter, if you're interested!), so something with the two of them relating on that level could be interesting if you'd like to include that aspect of Briar. (It's not on-page canon, so feel free to ignore it, but it is part of how I view the character.) Primarily, what I want to see is some kind of quiet moment(s) centered around these two and their family, whichever parts of their family you want to include. (Or not; I didn't officially request anyone else, after all!)

Practical Magic (1998) 
Frances Owens, Bridget \"Jet\" Owens

<strong>What I'd absolutely love to see:</strong> the aunts as 'mothers', either to Gillian and Sally, or to Kylie and Antonia. Or! Jet and Frances on their own, bantering back and forth, or an exploration of the various spells they do for the townspeople, or... You get the idea, I think. ;) One of the things I love most about the movie (and presumably the book, although I haven't read it) is that it does really well with the folk-lore and folk magic, but more in the sense of, \"This is something that feels like it could reasonably be a part of those traditions,\" rather than, \"This is something that SLAVISHLY ADHERES to this material I've researched.\" So anything with that would be fun, but most especially in the sense of, \"I am exploring and expanding and having fun with the magic side of things.\" SERIOUSLY DO NOT WORRY ABOUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH INTO FOLK MAGIC TRADITIONS.

Archer's Goon - Diana Wynne Jones 
Awful Sykes, Erskine (Archer's Goon), Shine (Archer's Goon), Venturus (Archer's Goon)

I love Erskine's relationship with the Sykes family, and his relationship with Venturus. I love Erskine in general, really, despite his Goonishness. :) I love how this book plays with the familiar elements of traditional British cozy-family YA fantasy and the \"found family\" trope. I love the cozy-claustrophobic setting, and the sort of general aura of not-quite-dystopia. If none of my suggestions appeal to you, you shouldn't feel the need to confine yourself to the nominated characters--I'd enjoy reading just about anything set in the world of this book

The Chronicles of Chrestomanci - Diana Wynne Jones

Sibling/schoolmate shenanigans! Canon ages, aged-up, anything you like. I'm endlessly fascinated by the different kinds of magic in this 'verse, and how it's applied and misapplied by people of any age who are learning to use their powers.

I got bitten by the theater bug at a very early age, so this book is one of my oldest favorites.

Does Miriam's talent really take her as far as everyone thinks it will? Is Mark truly finished with singing and theater forever? If the answer to any of these questions is \"no\", what happens next?

For Will, Jane, and Bran, I'm interested in fic about them as kids and pre-university teenagers, which could include romance (among any or all of them) if that interests you. If you want to write fix-it fic for the \"no one except Will remembers!\" ending I would welcome it, but if what interests you is \"no one except Will remembers and here's how that plays out\" fic, go for it. I'm interested in any interactions between Jane and the Lady, of course, but interactions between the Lady and either or both of the boys would also be welcome. I'm fine with focusing on just one or more of the named characters, if you're not interested in writing about all of them, and I'm fine with the inclusion of nonrequested characters, including characters not in the tagset.

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 

Quite a lot of fan fiction focuses on the canonical romances; so I'd prefer a story that's a bit different. Perhaps a gen school story or other backstory? Or war-time futurefic: <i>e.g.</i> Ralph's future in the Navy, Laurie after he's mustered out; life for the Straikes &amp;/or Aunt Olive during the war; Andrew with the Friends Ambulance Corps; Alec or Sandy as army doctors (or any combination thereof)? Other possibilities: an insider's view of the Bridstow scene, Bunny getting his comeuppance (or Bunny's p.o.v.), a slice-of-life at the E.M.S. hospital; Ralph in a P.o.W. camp. Feel free to include other characters besides those nominated.

I prefer canon-compliant stories that are gen or character-driven mild romance; but I'm not asking you to ignore canon relationships. However, I don't like anything more than PG13: explicit sexual detail is definitely a DNW for me. I prefer not to have characters die in the story; but references to canonical deaths are okay.  DNW second person fic.

Forever Knight 

Casefic is always a treat; and I enjoy ensemble stories, both in terms of the interplay back at the station and also the detective story plots. If you prefer to focus on an individual, perhaps family/personal life/backstory (for police characters), or history/backstory (for the vampires, whether Nick's \"family\" or Vachon's crew). By all means include characters who weren't nominated if you want. I like all three seasons equally.

I prefer gen; but I'm not asking you to ignore canon relationships. However, I don't like anything more than PG13: explicit sexual detail is definitely a DNW for me. I prefer not to have canon characters die in the story; but references to canonical deaths are okay.  I'm not interested in AUs or crossovers.

I love this book for Lassti, linguistics, the cast (especially Maggy!), and the detective plot. So as much of that as you can get into the story the better. A missing scene? Something aboard ship? A new case for the new judge? Or, if you like, something about the survey team after Tocohl leaves Lassti, particularly Buntec and Edge-of-Dark's dawning friendship (flowers <i>and</i> food!).  I love all the characters, including those who weren't nominated; so please feel free to include any of them.

Alias Smith and Jones 
Hannibal Heyes | Joshua Smith, Jed \"Kid\" Curry | Thaddeus Jones

I'd like some sort of adventure involving Heyes and Curry—maybe a heist or con they pull, or someone recognizes them, or there's some dangerous situation they need to deal with or someone who needs their help—anything along those lines.  I enjoy the comic side of the show, too, especially the banter between the two.

I like Heyes/Kid slash, if you're into that.  Either first-time or established relationship is good.  However, I don't care for smut, so please keep to a PG13+ rating. (Even better if you work it into a plotty fic!)

I'd prefer a story set more or less during the time line of the show (<i>i.e.</i> not backstory, nor futurefic about/after getting pardoned).  I'd prefer you <i>not</i> use any of the recurring characters from the series (other than the heroes, that is).  Explicit sexual detail is definitely a DNW for me. DNW AUs or crossovers. DNW second person fic.

Brian Lane, Esther Lane

I'd like a story about the Lanes.  I'm not interested in romance/smut, but in the sort of thing we saw on the show.

They've been married for many years, had their ups and downs, and know each other's idiosyncrasies by heart.  I'm open as to time period—during any season of the series, or backstory, or futurefic after Brian finally leaves UCOS.  (Do they really turn private detective?)  Feel free to use other characters from the show if you want. Including a current UCOS case is fine as long as the main focus is on Brian/Esther.

THE FLIRTING IN THE FIRST TWO EPS ALMOST KILLED ME, and then the end of the second ep actually DID kill me. :(

In my ideal world, the rest of the season would continue with Michael and Philippa running their ship together and working through what had happened during the attack, so I'd rather not have a fic that deals with the super-sad aftermath of an incident I would like to pretend didn't happen. 

Feel free to go totally off-script! Pre-series adventures of the U.S.S. Shenzhou would be AMAZING - we all know Star Trek is the birthplace of the world's best tropes, and I would give both my kidneys to see ANY of them played out with these two in starring roles. They're basically my Kirk and Spock, if that gives you any reference point. 

Please please please make them happy, make them gay. The rest is gravy.

Black Crystal Sword Saga - Ancient Bards (Albums) 
Daltor (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Dorus (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Sendor (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Shena (Black Crystal Sword Saga)

There are links to the canon on my letter page. Also: you do not need to try to write about all the characters I requested.

This trilogy is cheesy. It's shallow, and it's got magic and dragons and laughably thin characters. And I think it's really great. If you want to go a more serious, high fantasy route, do it. If you want to ramp up the cheese and just run with how foolish and incompetent the characters can seem, please do! Feel free to write about any or all of the characters I listed here, and including Alron or Rahed is fine with me even though they aren't on the list. (You can include any extra details from Sara Squadrani's blog posts about this saga or not.)

If it helps at all, my favorite songs from the saga are The Birth of Evil, All That Is True, Soulless Child, Through My Veins, and Hope Dies Last.

Here are some ideas for things I'm curious about:

Daltor - Why did Sendor target Daltor and his father? What was with the whole bear thing? When and how did Daltor learn to tame dragons like that?

Dorus - Just how much autonomy does he have? Is he just a puppet, 100% controlled by Sendor, or can he act on his own at all? What's it like to live without a soul?

Sendor - How did he find out about the black crystal sword in the first place? Or, how did he meet Shena? What was it that brought them together?

Shena - What's a kerim? They're described as \"elves of ice,\" but that's not much to go on. Why was it illegal for her to be in a relationship with Sendor? How did she deal with losing her son and Sendor all in one go (either when Dorus died the first time or second time)?

Any fic for this fandom that I didn't write would make me happier than I could say, and you do not need to try to write about all the characters I requested.

I'm always curious about the characters' backstories in this series, since we don't get a lot of information on that from the show. What was Galtar's life like before he met Goleeta? How did he meet or acquire Thork? What was Goleeta's family like? What was her kingdom like before Tormack? What motivates Tormack?

Or if you'd rather go a world-building route... do it! There's a strange combination of sci fi and fantasy in this world and it doesn't always seem to mesh very well. Why might that be? What happened to this world in the past to make it the way it is in the series?

I prefer no romance for this series.

Court of Fives Series - Kate Elliott 
Denya (Court of Fives), Amaya Ottonor, Agalar (Court of Fives), Bettany Ottonor

You do not need to try to write about all the characters I requested for this fandom.

I'm curious about all sorts of things about this series and its characters. Feel free to go into worldbuilding if you so desire, or write about any of these characters (or any combination of them).

Amaya &amp; Denya - I would love to see things from their perspective. What are they up to while Jess is doing her thing? What do they think of all of the changes taking place in Efea? How did they fall in love and become a couple? What happens to them after Buried Heart? I'd be totally happy with anything from G-rated fluff to explicit femslash.

Agalar - He was such a mysterious character... I'd love to know more about where he came from and those he left behind, and what he will do now.

Bettany - Another mystery. What was it like being the angry one who realized how unjust and unfair the world was in a household where everyone else just seemed to accept it? What will she do after the events of Buried Heart? Can she ever reconcile with her family?

Please do not write me fic for this series where Jessamy and Bettany act out any of the classic twin tropes. I don't want to see them switching places or tricking people by being visually / actually interchangeable, I don't want to see them as halves of some perceived whole, I don't want to see them finishing each other's sentences, and I don't want to see any sort of incestuous relationship between them. All of those are HUGE nos for me. In general, don't dehumanize them because they look alike.

Conan - Make some of the events of his history make sense. A lot of what happened to him while he was becoming the big bad barbarian just doesn't seem to fit together or make sense (at least to me). What's going on and why, and how does it all add up?

Valeria - What was her life like before she met Conan and Subotai? What if she had lived and carried on with Conan? Or, what if Conan had died and she had been the one to live?

I'll be giving basically the same prompt for each of the characters: how did they get to be the way they are when we see them in the novels? What might have been different had we seen things through their eyes instead of being limited more or less to Sarra, Cailet, Glenin, and Collan for POV characters?

The Pirates of Dark Water 
Ioz (Pirates of Dark Water), Ren (Pirates of Dark Water), Tula (Pirates of Dark Water), Zoolie (Pirates of Dark Water)

You absolutely don't have to write about all four of the characters I requested, though if you want to, by all means do!

In general - I like plotty, action-oriented adventure stories. If you want to write about the main characters finding another treasure not covered in the show, go for it. If you want to focus more on world building, that works for me, too. I'd prefer it if you didn't write romance, but if you have a great idea that calls for it, I can probably roll with that.

Ren - Does he miss his childhood at the lighthouse with Jenna? What are his plans for after finding all the treasures -- has he even thought that far ahead?

Tula - Were there any hints in her past that she might become an ecomancer? Or was she mostly just a warrior and seafarer?

Ioz - What kinds of scrapes and shenanigans did he get himself into before teaming up with Ren and Tula? I'm sure there are plenty of ridiculous swashbuckling stories he could tell... and some of them might even be true!

Zoolie - What's an average day like for him? What does he think of our brave heroes and their adventures? Or what were some of his own adventures before he \"settled down\" to operate that gaming house?

I've put only Frank here for maximum matching capacity, but he doesn't have to be the only character or even the primary focus. I'm down with just him, or him with one of the others, or him and Roberta and Bonnie and Mary, whatever you feel like writing, though I can only take Evelyn in smaller doses. I really love this movie and I'll try to write out some possible places to go in my DYA letter, but you can't really go wrong if you focus on Frank and Roberta. I just want to know so much more about them, how they became friends and allies, what's Roberta's story, or what happens with Frank (and maybe Bonnie?) after the movie. He's so changed by the end, how does that affect the way he raises Mary? There are so many places to go with this, so much that's unexplored in the film. Though the movie is pretty melancholy in a lot of ways, I'd prefer not to have something bleak or depressing, especially as regards Mary (and Fred!).

I've requested only Harry here, but I'm happy to have him interacting with anyone else, including other members of the Adjustment team or David and Elise, or even characters in another fandom. I'm just really in love with him, he's so gentle and sweet in his sweater vests and cardigans. &lt;3 More details in my letter, but I could see exploring Harry's viewpoint on the events of the movie, or possibly his history watching David and David's father, or what happens after the end of the movie--lots of options! Just more Harry, that's all I want for Yuletide.

Thomas \"T. J.\" Hammond

I've been so lucky to receive lovely TJ stories the past few times I've done Yuletide. So I feel greedy, but I always ask because I just can't get enough TJ. I love how broken and damaged and hopeful he is, how much he just wants someone to love and to be loved by, and how much of a fuck-up he is. There are a lot of types of stories to write with him, and I'm open to crossovers with other fandom characters (some possible ideas in my letter) as well as the ones in the show, just as long as Sean doesn't have a major role. Most of all, I'd love it if you can give TJ something resembling hope or even a happy ending, and I'd really prefer not to have bleakness, grimdark, or kink, please.

涼宮ハルヒ | Suzumiya Haruhi - All Media Types 
Suzumiya Haruhi, Kyon (Suzumiya Haruhi)

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

I love this series for its weirdness and its genre-hopping, but especially the strange rules of its universe and all the odd things you can do with them. I've nominated Haruhi and Kyon as characters; I ship it, but I'd be just as happy with fic about them as friends, or an it's-complicated-I-don't-know-what-we-are, or the UST thing they have going on in canon.

Some ideas I'd especially enjoy: Kyon gets hit with a truth spell; a look at their lives years in the future and how their relationship changes; any kind of supernatural weirdness; Kyon gains powers because Haruhi wants them to be equals

If you're up for writing porn, that would be cool, but I'd prefer it be set after they've finished high school. That said, I'd love to see fic explore what could happen with Haruhi's powers during sex.

Shoujo Kakumei Utena | Revolutionary Girl Utena

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

Every character in this series is brilliant, but Anthy and Utena's relationship is what I fell in love with the first time I watched it, and I'd really like fic about them as a couple. Some ideas:

    a missing scene about their developing relationship while they're still at school and everything's still very complicated - when was their first kiss, and were they really on the same page about their relationship then?
meeting again after school - how are things different when Anthy's been independent and looking after herself for a while now
If you're up for writing porn, I'd love some reunion sex for these two, the sweatier and filthier the better

Wayfarers Series - Becky Chambers 
Sidra (Wayfarers Series)

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

Sidra really sucked me in - something about her is really relatable even though I have never been a spaceship computing system stuck in a human-ish body kit. The way she goes about exploring her new world, and finding a lot of pleasure in it even though it's often challenging and upsetting to her, was really beautiful to me. I'd love some fic about her continuing to explore her new human-ish life.

    I loved the bit about Sidra looking to get a tattoo, and I'd like to see her try body modification again, whether it's tattooing or piercing or something else altogether, or everything she can find.
I don't ship Sidra with anyone in particular, but I'd love to see her exploring a relationship with someone, and especially exploring more of what touch means to her, whether it's with Pepper and Blue, or Tak, or an original character. I don't know what sex would be like for Sidra, but that would be something interesting to explore too.
I'm interested in how Sidra enjoys parties and festivals but interacts with them differently to other people. Going to parties and exploring dancing and meeting new people would be nice.

Battle Creek (TV) 
Russ Agnew, Milt Chamberlain

Russ/Milt slash would put me over the moon! There just isn't enough good slash for these two as a couple. If you feel you have it in you to write non-AU slash for these two, where Russ is his cantankerous, suspicious self and Milt is an assortment of secrets and sly wit hiding under a well-pressed suit and a Pollyanna smile, go for it!
If slash isn't your thing, I'd love a Gen fic focusing on these two. Any and all of the other characters are welcome to make an appearance, but please no Russ/Holly in place of Gen, and again… not AU. I love the characters and settings in their Battle Creek form, and just wish we'd gotten several more seasons of it.

Justified 
Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder

I'd love Raylan/Boyd slash, but if not then I'd prefer purely Gen. I love the complicated relationship between these two, the sense of them being not quite friends and not quite enemies. If Art were to make an appearance to snark the place up, I wouldn't mind. Drunk!fic, pre-series (the coal-mining days), collaboration, reluctant attraction-- all suggestions, none required, just trying to offer some inspiration.


Request 3 by HalfshellVenus
Die Hard (Movies) 
John McClane, Matt Farrell

John/Matt slash is always welcome (not kinky, please), or a Gen relationship fic. These two characters are opposite who balance each other surprisingly well, and usually with their own particular brand of dry, snarky humor. Matt trying to find a new job, or John in the throes of yet another dangerous adventure, or the two of them discovering romance in an unexpectedly masculine package, but again... this is just in case you need inspiration.

I wish we saw more of these two interacting. I feel like they actually could have a lot to offer each other, with their respective difficult secrets and troubled childhoods.

Mona Lisa Smile (2003) 
Giselle Levy, Elizabeth \"Betty\" Warren

I was so worried for what their ending would be, the first time I saw this movie (way back on DVD hire in like 2004), and so, so delighted for what happened. I must admit I fast forward a lot of the film on my rewatches but never them. I want to know about their lives together (I admit I ship it pretty hard, but close and supportive friendship would also be lovely). We never see them agree to live together - how did that conversation go? How does their flat look/get arranged/feel like to them? Where do they go, what do they eat, who do they meet? Or maybe you'd like to retell the arc of their relationship in the movie, or even before the canon.

The Martian (2015) 

So much to love about this movie (I also read the book, and I'm happy for you to draw on either/both). I mean, I love Mars, I love science competence that solves things, I love teams that go back to get the last guy, I love quests, I love the whole Earth getting united to Fix The Thing, I love snark about Aquaman. This was always going to suit me *g* 

As I've said above, I'm into stories about people interacting, generally speaking, so if you want to go the romance route Your Ship of Choice (including OT3 or more, with a preference for people being at least a bit queer somehow) is fine by me - I've seen various combinations for this fandom and liked them. Or cross people over into other fandoms as you like. I'd also love Space and Science to get in there - like what about future space missions? What about the first Mars colony? What about Saturn and it's cool moons? You could go to a Star Trek or Cloud Atlas type place or keep it more as The Nasa Coffee Shop, it's all good

The Americans (TV 2013) 
Elizabeth Jennings, Paige Jennings

Ok I finally started watching the Americans this year. I’m OBSESSED. 

Specifically, I really love Elizabeth and her dynamic with Paige. While I ship Phillip/Elizabeth, I’m more interested in the dynamic between mother and daughter. The similarities and differences between them – how Paige feels about her heritage, the added tension of raising a teenager who could ruin their lives.

To that end, I’d love something that explores the two of them. Maybe Paige gets dragged further in and goes on missions? How do her parents really feel about that? How does Paige feel about that?

Or maybe Paige rebels and outs her parents to Stan. What happens then?

What happens if Paige kills someone? What does that do to her? 

Or: Paige as a young-ish adult, out of college. Where is she and her family now?  Is she a spy? Did she get a normal life? Did they move back to Russia? Stay in the US?

If none of these grab you – I also would love to see Elizabeth in a spy mission where she seduces a woman. But not in a soft way, in a very Elizabeth way. You don’t have to include Paige if you go with this idea.

Note: I wrote this only having seen through season 4, but s5 is on Amazon Prime soon and I’ll be all caught up by December, so if any of this has been jossed, or you want to build on what happens in season 5, that’s totally fine!

The real draw of the Magicians for me is Julia, Marina (rip), and Kady. These characters hit the beats I tend to like in my media and I find that their stories are far more interesting than Fillory/Brakebills as magic in the real world is what interests me.

Ultimately this is a show about magic. There’s a lot of places you can go here. I’m pretty open to them all, except Fillory. I ship both Wickoff and Marina/Julia pretty hardcore and would love to see something hella tropey (soulmates, body swap, bound together etc) with either one of those two ships because they’re not characters who would take very kindly to that. 

I’d also like to see something from one of the other timelines where Julia is a student at Brakebills. What does that mean? I mean, yeah, Quentin dies in all of those timelines but *cough* I don’t care about that.

OR. More Hedgewitch backstory. How did Marina become so powerful? What would’ve happened if Julia hadn’t been kicked out?  What if Marina hadn’t died?  Who takes over after Marina’s gone?

Okay, this show man, this show. We could have had it all, but unfortunately MTV sucks. But I loved this show, I sat in on panels about this show at Austin TV Fest, I pimped it to everyone who would let me talk their ear off about it.

But, enough about my love and affection for it. What I want from you, should we match on this, is any of the following: case fic, post-finale fic, fic that leads up to what Jen said the ending would be (had she been able to get more seasons) where Ophelia takes the fall for Jules, fic that delves deeper into Ophelia’s fractured relationship with her mother. I am pretty open on the ship spectrum here – canon ships, Juphelia, Kennedy/Ophelia, Kennedy/Jules, Jules/Harris etc etc. The only real hard passes are poly ships and Ophelia and Harris, as I see their relationship as sibling-esque.

Please note: I requested the girls because I want the story to center around them, but I do love Harris as well, so please feel free to include him!

-It's implied in the short that Bill has been the man behind the curtain for several years. How did it start? Did he handpick James, or has Bill always gone after the person at the top, whoever they are? Both options are really interesting to me.
-What does Bill do with the tapes? Are there any further instances of James fucking up and Bill cleaning up after him? Post-short fic would be great!

-Something exploring the similarities and differences between them. There was that great moment in S3 where D'avin shared how he understood what it was like to be controlled by something in your head, to live with that shame and knowledge, and I am 100% interested in hearing more about it.
-More about what life is like for the Cleansed! I felt cheated that we only got hints about what life was like for them, and I'd love a Fancy-focused fic on what life is like, and what it means that D'avin wants them to fight in the war.

&nbsp;

-\"Are you fucking my hound?\"- Considering how Gabriel was very careful in trying to establish a sense of equality between him and Max, and not to make Max feel like he was a thing, how would their relationship change if they were fucking (from the start)? Would it be a power play on one of their parts? Gabriel trying to keep Max loyal or Max trying to make sure Gabriel finds him useful? Would it change things down the line?
-Osteomancer!Gabriel AU- I feel like this would be pretty dark, but I'm also very intrigued by how osteomancer!Gabriel would be different from how he is in canon. How would his and Max's relationship be different, considering Max's sensitive nose and Gabriel's relatives?
-What happened during the ten years between California Bones and Pacific Fire? What sort of power plays went down in LA that the new Director of the Water Department and his Assistant Director had to deal with? How did the progression from allies to best friends go, and did they even notice the progression? How many attempts on Gabriel's life have they had to deal with (or on Max's life)? How many people assume they're fucking, and are they/did they?
-What happens after? Getting shot didn't stop Gabriel from working, and Max stays by his side, so does this continue? Does Gabriel train up a protege or do they go out in a blaze of glory or what? If you want them to go out in a blaze of glory, then consider the 'permanent major character death' DNW lifted, but please don't linger on the process of them actually dying.
-What was Max's life like before Gabriel?

-What happens next? For Althea, who defied Ananke? For Mattie and Ivan, together now but heading towards an unstable rebellion? For Ananke, who has been rejected by all three of her \"parents\"? Where does the revolution, fractured and scared, go from here? Does Ananke go after Mattie and Ivan again?
-We know Ivan flirts with/seduces targets, and we see Mattie's jealousy. I'd love to read about Ivan undertaking a longer-term seduction and how that affects his relationship with Mattie. Pining, unstated (unrecognized?) feelings, sexual tension...all good. If you want to keep it in-line with canon and leave everything unspoken, that's cool, or if you want to go canon-divergent and have something happen between them, that's also cool.
-More about Ananke and Althea's relationship. Althea tried to kill Ananke, and Ananke punished her in a horrific manner. Now they're stuck with each other, so how does that go?
-I'd love to read more about Ivan, Mattie, and Constance, pre-series. I know Constance isn't nominated (four slot limit :/), but she's a huge part of their characters, so if you want to write about her, please do!
-Worldbuilding! There's so much that can be done with worldbuilding, and I'd be delighted to read any of it.

Ni no Kuni 
Oliver (Ni no Kuni)

So, what does one do after one has saved the world? Tell me about Oliver’s life post-game! Show me Oliver using magic to discreetly help out the people from his town, or going back to the other world to explore, or just hang out with his friends. The game hinted there are other parallel worlds out there: what are they like? What will Oliver be when he grows up: a racecar driver, a zookeeper, a professor at Hogwarts?
Ahem: the Great Sage Oliver. If Oliver hasn’t earned the title by the end of his adventures, he’s certainly well on the way. It doesn’t seem like a very demanding job when there aren’t any evil overlords around, but surely they do something with their time. Maybe a plucky traveller from the other world needs the legendary Great Sage’s expertise and has a hard time reconciling their expectations with reality?
Oliver could return to see the people whose hearts he mended during the game, and discover why exactly Shadar broke their hearts in the first place. Why was it so important to the Dark Jinn that this little catgirl not get a proper education? Why did that couple HAVE TO be thwarted from opening their shop???
At the end of the game, Oliver promises he’ll get on with his life. Is it that simple? Do his Motorville friends notice the changes in him? Is it weird to be friends with two versions of the same person? Is it hard to go back to school? How does Oliver pay the mortgage? Do child services notice he’s living alone?
Oliver survived the death of his soulmate, because Shazar severed their connection. But… is it really that easy? Are there no ill effects whatsoever to only having half a soul? Of course, his mom’s time-travelling universe-jumping antics managed to erase hers from existence altogether and she seemed fine (although… was this the reason she had heart troubles?).

Fate/Zero 
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne | Lancer (Fate/Zero), Arturia Pendragon | Saber (Fate/Zero)

These two give me life, from the moment they met and decided they were going to be Chivalry Buddies in this ruthless battle royale, to the bitter, bitter end. I’d love to have something shippy for them!
Missing scenes or stolen moments, no matter how little canon support there is - just them getting away from the war and simply hanging out, sparring to their hearts’ content, and why not a roll in the hay or two while they’re at it? Getting to know each other better, the awkward realization that he’s basically Irish Lancelot, the different ways their respective cultures interpret chivalry (and neither being quite what modern people think of as chivalry - more enemies’ heads as trophies, less ‘butbutbut I can’t hit a girl!’). Fun stuff!
Another possible tack is the fixit - perhaps in the AU created by Fate/Grand Order’s Accel Zero event if you’re familiar with that, or any canon divergence of your choosing. Maybe the canon divergence point is that they had different masters, or were summoned in a different class. How would that change things?
Or maybe an even more awful AU that flips the order of their deaths, or something equally tragic? Maybe Fate/Zero, sad as it was, was in fact the least horrible path their story could have taken?
Post-canon fic. Why not? There’s F/GO of course, a hypothetical sixth Grail War, an AU version of the fifth… There’s plenty of ways they could meet again! And it would be so awkward. He died cursing her, thinking she betrayed him, after all. It’s the kind of things that takes a while before one can get over it. (That just makes the reconciliation all the sweeter!) Just them slowly overcoming all that and growing close again, please. (Two things: 1)It prooobably doesn’t make sense for heroic spirit Diarmuid to forever have the scar from when he impaled himself with his own spear during that one Holy Grail War, but dammit I want him to have a scar. For, um, aesthetic reasons. Especially if it features during sex. Especially if he can’t remember how he got it because 2)The lore says he wouldn’t remember the events of Zero but she would. And man, there’s some delicious angst potential in 2), but feel free to ignore that one if you’d rather they both kept their memories - I’m fine with both scenarios.)

Fate/Grand Order 
Lancelot of the Lake | Berserker (Fate/Grand Order), Lancelot of the Lake | Saber (Fate/Grand Order)

I love characters having to deal with different versions of themselves from different points in their own timelines, and this canon is so great for that (especially since the “younger” versions still have vague memories of their “future”). To be the same person, and yet so fundamentally alien…
How do these two get along? Do they try to avoid each other? Do they seek each others’ company? Do they try to kill each other? Who was summoned first, and do they get territorial when the other shows up? Do they have to take down a dragon together to save their Master before they learn to work as a team? Are the other knights of the round table there? Is Arturia there? How well do they deal with having two Lancelots around?
How do they communicate? (I’m oddly charmed by the Protagonist’s attempts to bond with his/her less articulate Berserkers, from taking them on picnics to giving them chocolates for Valentine’s just like everyone else, so I’m guessing he/she would step in as an interpreter, at least at first.) I’d like it if they somehow, against all odds, managed to hash out their issues with each other and learn to accept themselves, even if one half of the conversation is carried out entirely in growls!
And here’s the spoilery bit: what’s their relationship with Mash like? How much time passed between the Camelot singularity and their summoning in Chaldea? Or was one or both of them already present (even, perhaps, along for the ride, with a front-row seat for the big reveal)? (Gameplay/story segregation is in full effect here; plot says they weren’t there, story mechanics mean they totally could have been, so go with your heart.) She’s not really their son-slash-daughter, but she’s also not really NOT their son-slash-daughter, and the whole situation is just so gloriously awkward. Zerkalot’s “About he Grail” dialog line is a very cryptic “Gala… had”, and I so dearly want to know what he means by that. Could be as simple as “Oh yeah, the Holy Grail. Yeah, Galahad found it that one time”, but where’s the fun in that? Most Servants use that line to say what they’d wish for if they had the Grail, so that’s a possible tack. Did he somehow sense or guess the identity of the heroic spirit possessing Mash long before everyone else? Or did he fight by her side for weeks/months without ever realizing? I dunno, I just want those three to be an awkward sort-of-family, beyond the Dad jokes.

Wakefield ruined Abby's life, she always lived with what he had done, was shaped by it. And when she comes back to her former home, it all starts again and she simply has to deal with it. I ship them but I would also enjoy Gen about their fucked up connection.

Prompt: Wakefield survives, Henry doesn't, and Abby has nowhere to run. Stockholm Syndrome, anyone?
Prompt: Abby returns home but not for the wedding. She is on her own and runs into Wakefield.
Prompt: Her father sent Abby away after the first murders. But Wakefield finds her even in her new home.

I really love this show and I especially love Axel. And I love Catherine despite her trying to kill him. I could always see the broken girl with PTSD in her and I was so sad to see her die. I don't even know how many times I watched the scene when she attacks him with that self-made spear in the cage, the way he shoves it away once and says 'Enough' as if he expects her to listen to him.

Prompt: Fix-it time! Mohamad saves her and they meet up with the group again? She needs no saving and finds the group by herself? And once they're back together, their arguing, her rage and fear and his power to actually protect her (together with Vanessa) lead to something new?
Prompt: The group decides against throwing Catherine and the others out of the hospital. Alliances and backstabbing for everyone!
Prompt: souldbond/trope-y stuff - The two of them end up with a soulbond that requires them to be close to each other. He can't throw her out because of that. Both of them are pretty pissed about the bond but that slowly changes.

&nbsp;

I loved the relationship between Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor. The support and trust between them, the tense camaraderie. I kinda figured Taylor was part of the conspiracy early on which didn't take away anything from the scenes between him and Barnes. Their last scene together, after Barnes shot Taylor and pulled him out of the car wreck, was amazing. Barnes' grief and anger over his partner's betrayal, Taylor's belief in his mission. Taylor starting to call Barnes \"Thomas\", Barnes returning the favour and calling him \"Kent\" as he died.

Prompt: A post-movie AU in which Kent doesn't die. Maybe he's in jail for his crimes and Barnes gets him out for a mission and there are ... feelings?
Prompt: Kent's group kidnaps Barnes before the attack, trying to get information out of him. But Kent can't betray him completely, is kinda protective.

Blades of Glory (2007) 
Jimmy MacElroy, Chazz Michaels, Katie Van Waldenberg

I love this goofy movie so very much but I love the characters an their interplay even more.

1: What the hell happens when Jimmy and Chazz land after the movie ends?  Was it a hallucination?  What even occurred?

2: Brotherly bonding!  This could be a missing scene or something that happens after the movie.  What does a movie night look like with these two?  

3: a Katie/Chazz/Jimmy committed poly situation, and all the weirdness that would entail. 

4: Katie and Jimmy getting closer, him proposing or her proposing!

5: Chazz becoming a big brother figure to Katie and Jimmy's offspring, them forming an extended close-knit family since all they have is each other (this would be an ideal way to write Christmas fic for them!) Basically every found family trope ever, please.

6: Chazz and Jimmy's training process for the next World Winter Sports Games.

7: Katie being badass and assertive as an assistant, with Chazz as her biggest advocate on the team.

8: They try another sport.  Doesn't even have to be a winter sport.  Just try to imagine Chazz and Jimmy synchronized swimming!

9: Katie's view on being part of Jimmy's life, and leaving her biological family behind.

10: Canon AU where Katie starts out as Chazz' coach and they take Jimmy under their wing after his adopted father all but disowns him.

11: Jimmy/Chazz - Something emotional or something kinky; I'm all for any of it.

Ninja Sex Party (Band) 
Danny Sexbang, Ninja Brian, Arin Neverbone, Samurai Barry

1: Any super-outlandish adventures with them.  The wackiest and yet most in-character thing you can think of!

2: Something meta-tastic.  Brian and Danny do Yuletide and are either the toast of the fest or become an object of horror!  Brian and Danny try to figure out fanfiction and one of them becomes fannishly passionate?

3: So we know what made Danny decide to go with dance over ninjadom - what set him on the path of trying to become the world's best lover (according to him)?  

4: A day in the life of slightly-competent galaxy-and-time-roaming crimefighters, successful or not.

5: Anything based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvLz5kCVIss\">6969.</a>  Cracky or goofy post-or-mid-video.  Maybe Brian and Danny have to do it to save the world?  Heck, even go bittersweet with it or uber-serious.  Maybe Dan accidentally killed the future by reintroducing sex to it!  Maybe the present he comes back to is ruined by what he did in the future?  Maybe he feels bad about forgetting Kristen's name?  Maybe Brian left his teacup in the future? 

6: Arin/Danny or Brian/Danny slash, as stabby and/or ridiculous or PWP-heavy as you want to make it.

7: Anything based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch%20v=Utj8DoSjfqo&amp;list=PLcIDqHah6ZnCp48Mixo9UvT505e7itqp7\">Any of the videos</a>.  There are lots to choose from!

8: What's Arin like when he's not chasing after Danny and Brian?  What does the SAP DO with its extra time?  Maybe there's a reason they're so pro-chastity.  I'd like to see if you can make them more sympathetic!

9: Ninja Brian backstory!  We don't know anything about him, at least not as much as we know about Danny.  What was he like when he was younger?  What's he like in his off-hours?  What's he like when he's doing something super-mundane? Do some world-building! 

10: Brian has a vague idea as to how Brian and Danny met once upon a time (A backstory Dan doesn't even remember writing); There's also an animated short that was shown at the last string of Rock Hard Tour concerts that explores this idea.  But what's your take?  How did they meet?

Romeo And Juliet - Shakespeare 
Mercutio (Romeo and Juliet - Shakespeare), Juliet Capulet (Romeo and Juliet - Shakespeare)

This is a very old favorite of mine, and I've enjoyed it ever since I was in high school.  Alternate histories, wild aus, alternate pairings and anything in between is what I'm looking for.

1: Juliet escapes her marriage to Paris, asking Mercuito to help her out.  The two of them either become friends or fall in love during the long trip to (general) safety.

2: Space AUs or Fairy Tale/mythological retellings of the canon.

3: AUs where Juliet is the only one to survive.  Five things fics. What if one little thing had changed?  What would she be like as an older woman, a mother, a nun, a spinster?  And what would change if Mercutio were alive?  Would he have gone on to become something or someone different?  

4: both characters (or just one of them) as ghosts haunting Capulets and Montagues. 

5: Mercutio meeting Juliet as a child instead of a teenager.

6: Simple everyday character studies.  What DON'T we know about these three?

7: Juliet rises to become a lady warrior and assume control of the Capulet holdings.

8: Mercutio's wit and wisdom, and his impression of life in Verona.

Lost Boys (Movies) 
Star (Lost Boys)

I adore this movie but Star's my absolute favorite character, so I've chosen just to request a story about her this time out!

1: Star before.  Who was she?  Who were all of the various hers that existed or might have existed before David and her conscription as the team's Wendy?

2: What about after?  Does she stay with Michael?  Is she able to accept her new, mundane life?  Can she accept the rigors of aging?  Of dying?  Does she become a mother and guardian beyond (likely) keeping an eye on Laddie?

3: Missing bits, hidden and lost scenes.

4: Star as the ringleader of the gang.  Would there be less desperation?  Moral improvements?  Less risky foolishness?

5: I am here for every single queer interpretation of her ever.  Does it add to or relieve her alienation?

6: Any and every kind of au you can bring to life.  Star heading a biker gang; Star running away with the circus; Star being Star, but somewhere else.

7: Star hanging around in Lucy's video store, developing a passion for film.  Alongside that - the march of time as seen through the world's transition from VHs rental to DVD rental to the loss of brick and mortar  stores.

Thelma and Louise (1991) 
Louise Sawyer, Thelma Dickinson

1: Backstories!  Tell me about their childhoods.  What if they'd met when they were even younger.

2: Obvious request: a nobody-dies AU.

3: Or worse: one dies, one lives, and the survivor has to deal with the legal fallout behind them.

4: Thelma and Louise as ghosts or angels/guardians protecting other vulnerable women out on the road.

5: Missing scenes!

6: Straight-up PWP.  I'll be frank, I would be one hundred percent fine with that.

7: Introspection and character studies.

Re-Animator (Movies) 
Daniel Cain, Megan Halsey, Bride of Re-Animator, Herbert West (Reanimator)

1: All of post-Bride, pre-Beyond angst where Dan ended up turning on Herbert legally.  Was it that easy?

2: Meg/Herbert/Dan poly situation where Meg lives and comes back (mostly) herself post-re-agent application.  Things are awkward or great.

3: Anything Meg-centric will please me.  Meg seeing Herbert's softer side.  Meg kicking ass and keeping them from fucking up.

4: Bride POV fic.  She's herself and yet not.  She's part of Meg, and yet not.  How does she handle this dichotomy?  Is there a world where she can, and can forge her own identity?  

5: Meg as a guiding force in the Bride's life from beyond - as a friendly spirit or ghost.

6: Dan and Herbert during their war years, or trying to live domestically after coming back to the states.

7: Anything that would involve heavy applications of the sweet, sweet crack and body horror these movies provide in dollops!

New Mutants 
Illyana Rasputin (New Mutants), Danielle Moonstar (New Mutants)

My favorite New Mutants stories are the Headmaster Magneto era, and I'd love to see some of him interacting with the kids, but I also love Dani/Rahne and, really, anything to do with Illyana. Dani is my favorite character. Honestly, anything relating to the classic New Mutants era would be wonderful - I don't care what characters you do or don't include.

I love all the bears equally so I'd really like ensemble slice-of-life stories. Alternately feel free to pick a random AU or have them meet some famous bears of history/literature/etc.

Milo Murphy's Law 
Milo Murphy

I'm happy with just about anything here as long as Milo's in the center of things being his usual calm self. Time travel hijinks? Bring on Cavendish and Dakota. Pre-show backstory with either Sara or Melissa? Go for it. Zack's past coming back to haunt him again? Why not? Or maybe a school story or just a wild adventure, or a glimpse of that Phineas &amp; Ferb crossover they keep teasing us with.

Wynd Family Series - Stephen Krensky 

I'd love to see the Wynds meet another magical family. Crossovers welcome or just expand on the magic in their world.

Alison, Edward, Jamie, Jennifer and Perry are the kids in a family with hereditary magical powers. The books are light magical adventures/mysteries in which the kids have to band together to save the day. I just love the entire family so I'd love to see either an ensemble adventure or focus on any member or members of the family.

The series is out-of-print but cheap used copies are available and all three books are available on Amazon Kindle.

My Two Dads 
Nicole Bradford, Michael Taylor, Joey Harris

Yes, I ship it. Michael/Joey, I mean. I'd love to see either Nicole playing matchmaker or maybe having a bet with the Judge about how long it would take them to figure it out. Or any other plot in tone with the series. 

On the off chance that you don't ship it, I'd be perfectly happy with a sitcom-esque plot with Nicole at the center. I'd appreciate it if you avoided some of the 80s gender stereotyping (especially relationship-wise) of the original, and keep it in tone with the original intended audience, but otherwise go wild.

Kitty Telefair Series - Florence Stevenson 
Kitty Telefair

A long out-of-print \"gothic\" series - 1970s urban fantasy before it was called that. Kitty is a member of a family of occultists, and does occasional stints on a television talk show. Mostly though, she deals with occult menaces of various sorts.

This is my long-shot fandom but I'd be happy with another case set in the 70s, what happened to her after the series, or maybe a time travel adventure to the present.

Northmen: A Viking Saga (2014) 
Asbjorn (Northmen: A Viking Saga), Inghean (Northmen: A Viking Saga)

No Thanks:
Slave worlds, demon-possession, mind control, prostitution, noncon, dubcon, character death, infidelity, love triangles/jealousy focus (I am far more fond of OT3ing it up), characters de-aged during the story (if you make one of the characters a child, make them “canon” children for that story if that makes sense), A/B/O, gangster/mob, noir settings, amnesia fics, loss of limb/amputations, mpreg, underage, gender swap, teacher/student stories, or focus on drug abuse or alcoholism. Regarding incest – I have exactly two sibling pairings that work there for me and I haven’t requested either fandom for this exchange, so please avoid that. Also, no parent/child pairings. Please no 2nd person or 1st person POVs except for the Innkeeper Chronicle request (enjoyed them in the past - just not in the mood this year for the other fandoms).  For M-rated fics, for triggering reasons I have to shy away from knife play/blood play/gun play (only in a sexual context – canon level plot/action violence is fine), scat, watersports, rape-as-fantasy-scenes, anal for M/F pairings, and any kind of direct blow in a sexual connotation even including spanking/flogging.

Yes Please:
Post-apocalypse fic, slice of life/domestic fic, epistolary stories, teamfics, found family, crossovers, AUs (particularly coffee shop, Black Jewels trilogy, daemons, steampunk/neo-Victorian, Sentinel/Guide, Old West, and Pacific Rim fusions), outsider POVs, supernatural elements, badass chicks and men who respect/lust after them for it, OT3s, fixit fics to bring back killed off characters, fics where characters have kids and are adorable parents, 5 and 1 style fics.  I’m definitely OK with an M-rating, and for smutty fics, I particularly love dirty talk, a clear top ordering their bottom around, hair-pulling, restraint i.e.: ropes/shibari/handcuffs/holding partner down, wall sex, shower sex, cramped vehicular sex, biting/marking (without major blood being drawn), mate bonds, “OMG we didn’t die” sex, and “sharing body heat” leading to sex.

Fandom Specific:
Tom Hopper pulled me into this teeny tiny fandom (No really – there are 7 fics. SEVEN. And I’ve written half of them LOL) after Black Sails moved him to the top of my fandom boyfriend list. I gotta admit, it’s such a terrible movie objectively, but it totally appeals to my love of questionable action movies.

We get all the Tom Hopper biceps you might hope for in his character (and the lead) Asbjorn, though sadly he never takes the shirt completely off. As the leader of the exiled and shipwrecked Vikings, he’s awesomely competent and has mad chemistry with the one female lead (in the entire film sadly), Inghean. She is a Scottish princess the Vikings kidnap in hopes of ransom only to discover her father prefers to see her dead than pay for her safe return. She also is the source of the one fantasy element in the film: an earth sense that warns her when the group is in danger.

All in all, I just desperately want a post-movie fic with these two. The movie ended so very abruptly, and there was so much more of the story hanging. How do they all survive the long boat? Do they ever find safety? Is it at the Viking encampment they hoped to find? Does Inghean’s earth sense end up more under control or cause people to see her as a witch? Will Inghean and Asbjorn EVER do more than stare at each other longingly? LOL

Fandom Specific:
Ilona Andrews basically owns my readerly soul LOL. I mainlined through everything they’ve written last fall &amp; have devoured every new book that has come out since them. The Innkeeper Chronicles series is definitely my fave though. Really what’s not to love about an intergalactic Bed and Breakfast? I put “any” for character choices because honestly I really love all of the characters in this story, including the inn itself, Gertrude Hunt which DEFINITELY feels like a character all on its own. Just FYI tho, I ship the canon ships, so please no Dina/Arland or Sean/Maude stories if at all possible.

So, prompt/concepts I’m excited about: I’d love to have a 1st POV fic ala the books (though from any character you like – Dina, of course, is always a win as the book’s POV character, but I’m game for a look into anyone’s head!), &amp; I’d like it mostly set in and around Gertrude Hunt since the inn is a delight. Domestic fic in particular would make me super happy here. We always see Dina in a panic, but rarely get those calm moments of life running like normal or even with a guest that ISN’T close to causing an intergalactic incident. Are Arland, Maude, and Helen visiting for a holiday? Have Dina &amp; Sean finally made it official &amp; started bonding Sean to the end? Is Orro in a tizzy? Does Caldenia have a visitor who ISN’T trying to claim a bounty for once? Of course, if you do want to write an actiony fic I’d be happy to read that as well. Seriously run wild – this series just makes me happy in general LOL

Oh! BTW, I would TOTALLY be thrilled to have a crossover with any of the other Ilona Andrews series as long as it’s taking place in the Innkeeper universe. I mean, it’s already canon that Edge verse characters have made it there, but what about a visit from Julie &amp; Derek ala the Kate Daniels books? Or one of Nevada’s sisters &amp; cousins from the Hidden Legacy books? I think that would be a TON of fun for sure. (Hell, now that I think about it – a crossover with any of the other fandoms I’ve requested would also be a blast. This fandom just totally works for crossover fics in general I think!)

Fandom Specific:
Oh yeah, I shipped it. I shipped it HARD. Honestly, I’ve never quite gotten the appeal of Tom Hiddleston, but oh holy hells this movie convinced me! Conrad and Weaver’s chemistry was fantastic, and I loved how well they worked together. My competency kink was definitely tingling every single scene they had together. I think what I really want is post-movie fic for this one. Do they drift apart and find their way back to each other during another strange creature related incident? Do they join Monarch &amp; get read into the Godzilla insanity? Just give me these two confident badasses together facing the world after learning that it was so much bigger in some places than they ever knew.

Fandom Specific:
I both loved and hated this movie. Most of it was so right up my alley I could hardly stand it, but I have to admit I was disappointed by the way ladies were fridged right &amp; left, and that The Mage didn’t even merit a name. So, I want her story. Who is she really? I thought her to be Nimue, but I know some people see her as Guinevere. Could she be Morgana? I want to know who she is and why she risked so much for Arthur, especially if Merlin was dead and gone. Hell, who even was Merlin to her? Just a leader of her people or more? Feel free to ship her if you like! I’m game for Mage/Arthur or even Mage/Maggie or Mage &amp; one of the brothel girls. Femmeslash, as always, is definitely welcome. I’m game for the rest of the cast making appearances too, but she should be the focus. Just give me awesome Mage fic. That’s all I ask.

You don't understand how much I love this pairing. Seriously, these two are my catnip.

Kazufumi is the friend of Nagano family. When Hina was a little kid, his parents were killed in a car accident and Kazufumi took him in and raised him. Hina grew up having feeling for Kazufumi, and sometimes feel guilty that because of raising him, Kazufumi couldn't get married.

And then Hina just has to join group of thieves, and Kazufumi the police didn't know the thief he's chasing is Hina! Ahhh my heart!

All the angst! All the forbidden feelings! I want loads more of it! And I want the feeling to be reciprocated! Please! Something happy for these two they had gone through so much TT^TT

I just want ANYTHING! Pwp, fluff, their first date as couple, Hina threw himself at Kazufumi, AU without the whole bandit heist thing, Soul mate au, ANYTHING!

I am a sucker for people at war coping with the horrifying realities they are participants in, I am a sucker for comrades in arms coping together, I am a sucker for flash-in-the-pan friendships and romances that only last a moment or lifetime and are exactly what is needed right in that moment.

I would love to see more moments in-between. Corran is my favourite, a good start, but I will be so pleased to read about any and all of these hot shot pilot rebels and the important nothing moments that make up most of their time together &lt;3

I will jump at any chance to queer up the Star Wars Expanded Universe in any way, representation is my jam, but I'm perfectly happy with gen stories, and doubly so if they have casual no-big-deal diverse queer casts.

You could write the weather report in this world and I would be so so so so so happy. Seriously. Worldbuilding, missing moments, long introspective character pieces, like anything. I love Ged, I love characters who flicker in and out like Vetch, Tenar's powerful outsider view of the gender dynamics of Earthsea are my favoured wisdoms, I ADORE Arren and everything about politics in Earthsea, and every word Tehanu thinks brings me a deep happy-sad satisfaction. Pick any moment or any tiny character or any side quest or any red herring wordbuilding clue that spiked your interest and I promise you I will adore hearing more. Ogion and his goats chilling? Yes. The childhood friend witch who tried to run off with Ged in the frozen northern Keep? YES. The ancestors of the ladies keeping the old house where the great ancient king once stayed in that one Tales of Earthsea ancient background side story?  YES!!! Something you COMPLETELY CAME UP WITH using this place and setting and with only tangential relations to the characters we know, be it millennia in the past during or before the reign of Erreth Akbe or centuries after when everyone we know is dead and gone, YES THIS IS GOOD TOO!!!

- Julie before the war. Julie growing up -- if you've read The Pearl Thief, feel free to include any canon you've gleaned from that; if you haven't, feel free to make up what you want.  
- Julie on missions during the war. Julie being smarter than her enemies. 
- Julie falling in love. Julie pretending to fall in love. Julie realizing too late that she's in love. 

Feel free to use any/all other characters from canon as you see fit; I've read all the books so I'm good there. I do very much love Julie/Maddie, and also Julie/Ellen (from the Pearl Thief), and also will gladly read gen or het or whatever you come up with.

Taboo (TV 2017) 
James Delaney, Zilpha Geary

When I saw Taboo, I was instantly like, oh boy, this is a Yuletide fandom. 

(Obviously this show is super fucked up, including but not limited to the, ah, explicit incest, so don't feel like you need to tread lightly with content.) 

I just want anything and everything about Delaney and Zilpha. Maybe scenes from each of their lives when they were separated when Delaney was in Africa. Maybe something from their earlier life, showing how they ended up taking their relationship to, uh, a different place.  Maybe Zilpha really isn't dead? 

Go ahead and use any of the other characters in the show, too.

If bad things happen to Zilpha, that's fine? It's canon, for certain. But I guess I'd prefer not to see explicit violence against her written out in great detail. 

Of all my requests, feel free to just get really heckin' weird with this one.

Kushiel's Legacy - Jacqueline Carey 
Phedre no Delaunay, Joscelin Verreuil

It has been ages since I've read these books but Phedre and Joscelin are my forever OTP and I would read any story about them. Here are some thoughts.

- Any sort of \"missing moment\" throughout canon
- We know they go on some of their own adventures after the original trilogy/during the Imriel books. What are their adventures?
- Sexytimes, obviously. Of any kind. 
- Quiet moments at home? Loud moments of court intrigue? 
- Young Phedre, headstrong and brash. Older Phedre, still much the same, but wiser. Phedre and Joscelin growing old together, content, beautiful.

I am a super huge fan of Hyacinthe/Phedre/Joscelin, if you want to use him in any way, too. 

As always, feel free to toss in other characters from throughout canon, and clearly, this is another canon where things can get dark and if that's the direction you want to go in, that's fine. (I would prefer not to read about non-consensual violence against women. Consensual kink/BDSM play is fine.)

Cynster Family Saga - Stephanie Laurens 
Sylvester \"Devil\" Cynster, Honoria Cynster

I’d love some sort of an outsider’s point of view of their relationship (and it can be at any point in time). A servant’s point of view, Lady Osbalderstone’s point of view, their children’s point of view … whatever really. I for one, would think it would be hilarious to see the thoughts of the servants about certain happenings that take place at the Place in The Untamed Bride (which I know isn’t technically part of the Cynster Family Saga books but does feature the Cynsters heavily). And if you’ve read the book, you know what I mean. Alternatively, I’d like something about Devil’s and Honoria’s thoughts and feelings when they might have to worry or fear about their children (for instance, in By Winter’s Light when Sebastian and Michael are with their cousins, stuck in a storm, where Lucilla is assisting with a birth of a baby).

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Roberto Nicholas, Hiraga Josef Kou, Lauren Di Luca

This show was one wild trip, but definitely never boring for a second. Maybe it was the cocaine. Anyway, the cracky enjoyment of the incredibly paced anime aside, I genuinely grew very attached to our investigator duo. Something about their mutual high respect and affection for each other (which doesn’t mean they won’t drag each other in public for the occasional short coming re: science or understanding human relationships, which only goes to show they are true friends imho) is just very touching, and seeing them stumble into murder conspiracies every second Thursday and solving them with casual grace, common sense and some liberally applied Catholicism was always a joy to watch.

So I would absolutely love a case fic for them! Go wild with conspiracies, red herrings and out-there motives, last minute twists, fake exorcisms and deii ex machinae! If you have any local trivia to share, please do, because casefics set in the real world (or the heightened reality this show is set in, rather) are the ideal opportunity for that and I really enjoy reading about other places.

However, I would equally like just a fic about them hanging out together when off-assignment, in case you’re not up for murders and mayhem - just a nice day where neither of them is about to get murdered for once, you know what I mean.

For these two, I like everything from just their close relationship in canon to a more definitively romantic take, so please feel free to go with either.

Also, I very much like Lauren and his friendship with Hiraga versus his tolerance for Roberto, so him making an appearance of some sort is also always welcome!

Aldnoah.Zero (Anime & Manga) 
Kaizuka Yuki, Marito Kouichirou, Mazuurek (Aldnoah.Zero), Yagarai Souma

Note: for this fandom, I’m also fine if you don’t include all the requested characters! Focussing on any of them will make me a happy reader :D

Yes it’s been three years and I’m still hung up about this show, mostly about the older generation of the UFE side to be specific. I loved literally everybody among the Wadatsumi/Deucalion crew a metric ton, and how they all just got along so well without any unnecessary drama was just very refreshing somehow.

Really just anything with them interacting would be great! I have a particular soft spot for Marito and Yagarai, no matter if as friends or lovers. Their utter unshakeable trust in each other and supportive relationship developed so naturally and the strong sense of familiarity their interaction conveys was something for sure. Staying together is a strong (or main) motivator for them to fight (in Yagarai’s case, to enlist in the first place), and there’s the fact that Yagarai is one of two people who recognise Marito’s exceptional qualities even when he’s at his lowest point in life post-Tanegashima. Yuki being the other one, of course, and her friendship with and loyalty to Marito is just great. So anything about them, both during the series or after, would be lovely!

Also, any mundane adventure including Count Eastercake of Arabia Mazuurek would also be much appreciated! I ended up really liking this accidental double agent and his generally cheerful disposition. I thought it was a bit unfortunate that we never saw him interact with the ones who actually bested him in combat, so I’d love to have him meet Marito and Yuki, seeing how he seems to remain on Earth post-canon and clearly enjoys befriending former enemies and learning about their lives. (Also if you’re up for a challenge - truth is, I’d really love to see anything involving Mazuurek and Yuki in a more shippy way. It’s a one-man rowboat kind of ship, I know, but they actually might make a nice couple! They have quite a lot in common - both are Inaho’s biggest fans, both are great with children, both care aggressively for those around them (with more passion than advisable in an all-out war), both are upbeat and warm people who can ruthlessly get things done if necessary and are a force to be reckoned with. TL;DR: I’d love to see any take of Yuki remaining utterly nonplussed by his quick changing between being genuinely sweet and smugly arrogant. Those voice switches, mate.)

モノノ怪 | Mononoke (Anime & Manga) 

Mononoke was an absolutely unique experience, especially because we learned so little about the main character, and so much is still a mystery. The series lends itself to casefics in particular, the wandering exorcist/medicine seller appearing across centuries just at the right time, and seeing how the people affected react to him and his seemingly very grey morality when it comes to saving humans. Mononoke plays a lot with absolutely unreliable narration and people’s lies, which always makes for an interesting narrative. Also, the challenge is of course capturing the surreal style and atmosphere of the anime, so if you are up for a more experimental request, I think this might be the choice for you!

While a look at how he and Hyper are connected and work together is very interesting as well, I think a spelled out origin story would take away some of the charm of this character. Also, please no shipping between those two!

Fantastic Four (Comicverse) 
Valeria Richards (Comics), Franklin Richards (Comics)

I love the FF.  I especially love Valeria, Franklin, and the other Future Foundation kids.  Kids are a tricky thing to pull off in comics, but Franklin and Val are capable enough to hold their own.  They also have a sibling relationship that can run either antagonistic and envious or all in, which feels very accurate to me.  Both of the Future Foundation runs have great moments for them, but I particularly like the end of Hickman's FF and the Dark Reign: Fantastic Four mini. I'd love anything that focuses on their sibling relationship or that features them teaming up! Any/all other Fantastic Four/Future Foundation characters are also great and I'd be super happy for them to be included.

I have such a weakness for Regency period stories and magic and girls being smart, so this series always feels like it was written for me.  I love the bantery romance.  I love the magical elements.  I definitely love the Regency trappings - the balls, the dancing, the weird etiquette and dialogue.  Wrede and Stevermer do such a great job giving all of the characters their own voices and making the girls clearly the heroines, even while keeping much of the period-specific sensibilities.  I didn’t request Thomas or James but they’re certainly welcome if you so choose!

Champions (Comics)

My other Marvel faves.  Mark Waid's Champions run was a little hit or miss for me, but the friendship between these three was definitely a stand-out element.  I love that they're going through so much of the same things so differently (highschool, parents, superheroing).  I really enjoy seeing them come through for each other and also seeing them relate/not relate to older heroes.  Note: Gen or romance are both fine for this, but if it's the latter, I definitely lean more towards Sam/Kamala (Samala?) than any of the other combinations.  Although I was definitely intrigued by Miles's apparent interest in a Sam/Kamala/Miles love triangle in the All-New All-Different Avengers Annual, so feel free to play around with that

So the Robot Devil's always been my favorite minor Futurama character, but he's so underutilized in fic! I will take just about anything--trying to make a deal with someone (successfully or unsuccessfully), the ups and downs of running Robot Hell, additional run-ins with Fry or Leela after the events of \"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\" (or set during it), how exactly he wound up granting Calculon his UNHOLY ACTING TALENT, etc. I also think he and Bender play off of each other really well, particularly given the fact that Bender's evilness shocks even him, so you're welcome to explore that in any way you see fit.

The Simpsons 
Sideshow Bob

Bob's my favorite Simpsons character by far, but I really hate what the show's done with him over the last decade or two. (Well, I hate what the show's done with just about every character over that timespan.) I'm less interested in Sideshow Bob as a deranged psychopath and more interested in Sideshow Bob as a guy who perpetually struggles with the notion of forgiveness instead of revenge. He's bitter about a lot of things, some of it justly, and some of it unjustly, but he's still capable of emotions like guilt.
There are really a lot of ways you could go about this. Bob and Krusty, at any point in their lives (first meeting, during the time they were working together, after Krusty was framed, after Bob tried to kill him, etc.), Bob and Bart (any time after Bob was sent to jail the first time, including the times that they worked together)--hell, I'd even be interested in the two Sideshows, Bob and Mel, getting to interact more! Maybe even Bob and his brother Cecil in jail squabbling over who gets the lead in a prison production of \"The Mikado\" or something like that. (The more high culture--or at least highbrow culture--you can work into it, the better. He's basically evil Frasier with more hair, after all.)

DNW: References to Bob's faceswapping or genetic modification. It's not a squicky thing (well ok, maybe a bit with the whole \"cutting your face off\" thing), I just really dislike the whole premise of those episodes because they're too farfetched.
