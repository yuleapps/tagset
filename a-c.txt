Temeraire - Naomi Novik 
Tenzing Tharkay, Sipho Tsuluka Dlamini, Emily Roland, William Laurence

There are SO MANY fics I might like to see in this fandom, and those characters I listed are all options - you don't have to try to put all of them in. Ship-wise, I'm very fond of Laurence/Tharkay and Emily/Demane, but gen is just as good. Do Not Wants include noncon and unleavened bleakness.

I'd be happy with any fic you'd like to write within those parameters, but if you would like prompts, here are some!

1. Tharkay adjusting to his new life. How does he deal with being responsible for the land and its tenants? Does this mean he has to deal with other gentry now? What do people think of his permanent guests, Laurence and Temeraire? Does he get sucked into Temeraire's political career by sheer proximity? Does Lady Allendale involve herself? Are his cousins still plotting to sell him out to the French?

2. Sipho's continuing education. Basically I would just love to see fic where Sipho's tutelage under Temeraire continues until he ends up in university and becomes the world-class cartographer and natural philosopher we know he will be one day.

3. Emily and Demane making it work. Sailors made it work; who says aviators can't? (Okay, Emily's mum, but she's a bit biased.)

4. Laurence's retirement. Exactly how long does that last before more adventures happen to him?

I honestly got so fond of Charon in this game, and was really fascinated by his code of conduct. I'd love something exploring Charon's partnership with the Lone Wanderer. Personally, I played a female protag who erred on the side of altruism, but however you play it, he's watching this kid pull off some crazy stuff. What's his perspective?

Westworld (TV) 
William (Westworld)

Okay, I'm going to do my darnedest not to spoil anything for innocent bystanders, so away we go!

William's my favorite character (I love the different facets of him we get to see, his all-consuming need for meaning, and the idea that even virtues can become destructive if taken to extremes) and I'm most interested in his development following his first visit to the park. I'd love to see more of the \"real world\"--his home life, corporate maneuverings at Delos--and how his perception of these things changes as a result of his time in Westworld. (That said, if you want to write a story that takes place solely in the park, go right ahead.) How does he get from the person he is at the end of his initial arc to the man he'll ultimately become? (You don't have to answer that, obviously--but I'd love to see one of the steps along the way.)

I love William's relationships with Dolores, Lawrence, and Logan, and would also be really interested in learning about his family. But really, include whoever you like--tell me about him meeting Ford for the first time, for instance.

I also really dig the way the show plays with time and memory, so a more experimental approach would be great too! Anything that expands on the ideas or world of the show--there's so much that's hinted at, or just left open to explore--would be phenomenal.

Baby Driver (2017) 
Baby | Miles

So my favorite scene in the movie is the one where Baby's getting coffee. It was such a fascinating glimpse at the way his mind works and the world he inhabits--I'd adore anything that could capture that feeling.

I'm also intrigued by Baby's past (I'm a sucker for childhood flashbacks)--I'd love to read about the first time he met Doc, car-theft-related shenanigans, or a musical discovery he made when he was younger (bonus points if you manage to incorporate car-theft-related shenanigans). His relationship with Joe is wonderful, I'd love anything about them--pre- or post-movie. And if you'd rather write about someone else, go for it!

I also love car chases (go figure) and stories with a strong sense of place, so if you just wanted to write about Baby zipping around Atlanta, I would be absolutely fine with that.

Mad Men 
Don Draper, Sally Draper

Sally is the Mad Men character whose post-finale fate I'm most interested (and invested! please let things turn out moderately okay for her!) in. I'd really love to see how she evolves as a person, and how that affects her relationship (or lack thereof) with Don. I can imagine all kinds of futures for her, and I'd love to read about either one possibility in particular or a five-things-type exploration of different paths she could take. I'm also interested in how she comes to terms with her own past, as well as Don's (what she knows of it--how much does he wind up telling her about himself? is there anything she finds out on her own?).

If futurefic isn't your thing, a Sally-and-Don moment set during the show would be fantastic, too--maybe sometime between seasons 3 and 4 (the first time he sees the kids after the divorce?), or Don sharing something about himself with (or being reminded of something about himself by) her.

Hut 33 

f you can get the humour of this, I will love you and everything about this series. The quasi-Blackadder of it makes me extremely happy, so should you wish to transpose the setting/context Blackadder-style and AU it, that is perfect. Minka delights me, as does Charles, as does everyone, but I'm as happy with a single Archie-perspective read as with a series-style script, so whatever method takes your fancy. I'd love the team to actually succeed at something important, whether by design or mistake, or I'd also be really happy with an improvised festive time with this. Again, more in letter!

As above, really! Again, it's the sheer bloody-minded fun of it amidst the most head-bangingly frustrating characters. I love when Bernard actually has to engage with the art of bookselling, either by buying more books, or doing tax returns, or anything else...I'm imagining him trying to deal with the influx of YA into publishing (perhaps he is an unexpected fan? At the very least he ought to love The Hunger Games), author visits, cardboard promotional material that doesn't fit together properly, the Christmas rush, the very notion that the British public are once more reading and buying books from bookshops...I would love any kind of bookish geekery.

Again, I'm also super here for any weird AU/crossover/crack. I love all the characters, and really, the whole everything

Amelia Peabody - Elizabeth Peters 
Amelia Peabody Emerson, Radcliffe Emerson

Amelia and Emerson are such wonderful characters. I love Amelia’s strength and her foibles, her idiosyncrasies and her fabulously distinct narrative voice, her love for Emerson and her love for archaeology. Meanwhile Emerson’s love for Amelia is so manifestly evident at all times and endearing (plus I love his own archaeological fervor). And their banter, conversational style, working together, arguments, and reconciliations are all so much fun to read about. If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): How about a story about their relationship over the years – perhaps five times Peabody rescued Emerson and one time Emerson rescued Peabody, maybe? (Or vice-versa.) (Five-times fic in general is great.) Or maybe they have an adventure together that didn’t get recorded in the books. Or maybe one of them is writing an article about best archaeological practices and the other provides input. ;) Or perhaps you’d like to write a story from Emerson’s POV (either first-person or third-person is great).

If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): What adventures might Harry and Corlath have together after their marriage? What's Narknon's perspective on their relationship? How might they solve a mystery together? Do they ever visit Ihistan and/or Harry's homeland together? Or what about an AU in which Corlath doesn't kidnap Harry, or an AU in which Harry and Senay are the ones who fall in love?

Tell me a story about Polly! If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :)

A few prompts (more in my letter): What's Miss Snelgrove’s POV of Polly’s career at Townsend Brothers? How might Polly and Eileen have fallen in love? (And did Binnie ever figure it out?)

Jewish Scripture & Legend 
Naomi (Jewish Scripture & Legend), Rut | Ruth (Jewish Scripture & Legend)

Naomi and Ruth are one of my earliest ships. I think Ruth’s speech is one of the most beautiful ever written, and it’s no coincidence that it appears in so many romantic contexts (and is often used in wedding ceremonies). As a young, childless widow of marriageable age, it would have made so much more sense for Ruth to return to her family, as Orpah did. To journey into a foreign land with another widow, without any male support, where they would struggle on the margins of society? (The reason Naomi and her husband had originally left Judah was because there was a famine there, after all.) To cleave to Naomi was a brave choice indeed for Ruth, but she makes it so passionately and with such conviction. Then she supports Naomi by going out to glean, and when she marries Naomi’s relative (with Naomi’s urging) and has a child, does the village say “Boaz has had a son”? No, they say “There is a son born to Naomi,” and Naomi cradles him in her bosom. ♥

While I have no problem with historical detail if that’s what you are excited about writing, I also don’t mind at all if you blur/handwave the historical accuracy (or if you take Ruth and Naomi’s story out of its context entirely, in the case of my AU prompts).

See my letter for specific prompts. :)

Ben 'Light Boy', Johnny (Dare (2005))

I love the ambiguity in this! I love Johnny's badness! His seductiveness! I love the tension! I love how it sort of drops off at such a point where you don't know what would have happened next. Do they return to form, ignoring each other, or even turning hostile? Do they meet again in secret? Can Ben ever get over his lust? Is Johnny capable of being more authentic and true to himself? Could they become friends, or more? There's a push/pull dynamic that's really sexy for such a short piece. I'd love to see a scenario where the tables are turned--where Ben is out and happy with himself, and it's Johnny, still closeted, but envious of Ben's freedom, who makes the first move. I'd love to see Ben string him along a bit. But really, anything more with these two will make me super happy. There's nothing like two hot guys, some ambiguity, and some splashy-sexy times.

They're also gearing up to make a sequel next year, yay! So that's another tack you could take--Jonnny and Ben, years later, meeting up again for a dip in the pool. Is Ben Johnny's dirty little secret? Or do they happen to meet randomly, only for sparks to fly once more?

Would Walsh even seem charming next to a bunch of other Reptilians? What would Ozzie think of Walsh's homeworld? Does Walsh's homeworld even exist anymore? Does Jeff's? What's with the cover memories involving deer? And what made them choose deer? What other fun-sexy advanced technology to aliens have access to? Why does Walsh prefer his human suit? Oh, or what if they ended up on Jonathan's homeworld and Ozzie had to pretend to be his slave/pet/boyfriend/husband/boss? What if, according to Reptilian status markers, Jonathan's considered a real nobody because he has to work on Earth? What if they get to ~Reptileworld and Ozzie's super popular for some reason? Or what if Jonathan's actually capable of babies? Go wild, I say! This is the canon for just about anything. :) 

And I love the whole cast, so though I'd love Jonathan and Ozzie (and Jonathan/Ozzie), feel free to have fun with everyone else. More of Don's lightning-fast processing of emotions, more of Nancy's random feminism, more of Yvonne's weapons EVERYWHERE. Just--moar, please!

Suikoden III 

Suikoden 3 is my favorite RPG of all time in terms of its worldbuilding. The realistic qualities of the world, in both the overall plot and the small details - racist innkeepers! Real, serious emotional trauma from war! An alliance that is fragile and, ultimately, broken! - still fascinate me, despite the game being 16 years old. What I'm most interested in seeing is what canon teases but, ultimately, denies us - a chance to see the future, past Suikoden III. I'm particularly interested in how the characters have grown and changed in the tumultuous, war-ravaged world. How does Chris cope with the war with Tinto, especially with things as fragile as they are in the Grasslands? How does Zexen as a whole deal with their Knight Captain never aging, eternally youthful? How do Thomas and/or Cecile hold on to Budehuc - or do they not, and are left desperately trying to find a place that would accept them? How would Chris feel to see an older Thomas and Cecile as soldiers signing on for a war? How does Geddoe feel about how things are left in the Grassland? Does anything change in his troops after his friends find out his true origins? 

In terms of ships, I would prefer Thomas/Cecile. I tend to ship Chris with Salone and Geddoe with Queen, but I am alright with gen for any of the four nominated characters as well but would prefer not to see the character(s) in other ships. (Past relationships is fine.)

The Good Place (TV) 

The Good Place is a show that has come and absolutely stolen my heart this season. I absolutely adore the characters, the setting, and the mythology of the show. I'm most interested in an exploration of how things change over the many, many times Michael has wiped the Main 4's memories - how do they handle it when they get deja vu? How do the demons handle having to keep their stories straight time and time again? Does Trevor come in to assist? What happens to those who Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani/Jason left behind? Does Jason ever get corrupted from how much Michael is rebooting her? Will Janet and Jason ever fall in love again? Has Janet ever figured out she is in hell? How does the soul-mate switch up affect the crew over those many reboots? What was the magic panda? Did the Seduce Michael plan actually work?  How long have they been in hell, anyway?

I'm staying current on the show so please do not worry about spoilers. In terms of ships, I basically ship the entire cast with one another, but I'm especially fond of Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Michael. Would not say no to pretty much any combination of the main 4 + Janet/Michael/Trevor. No problem with demon or computer/human. Am also open to gen for any.

Atomic Blonde (2017) 
Lorraine Broughton, Emmett Kurzfeld, Delphine Lasalle

I quite liked Atomic Blonde in theaters this year. I'm all for spy on spy action, and the canonical femslash pleased me greatly. I'm mostly looking for fic playing on the lack of trust inherent in these relationships; how do you trust anyone, or love anyone, in a time so bleak as the cold war? What makes them want to be spies? Are they loyal to their countries? One another? Why was the CIA double-crossing the British? Why was Lorraine a triple agent? Was Delphine a baby spy, or was there more to her than how she presented herself? 

In terms of ships, I would love Kurtzfeld/Lorraine or Delphine/Lorraine but I am open to gen as well.

Suicide Squad (2016) 
Harleen Quinzel (Suicide Squad (2016)), Floyd Lawton (Suicide Squad 2016)

I loved Suicide Squad. It's so cartoonishly grimy and fun and I love the idea of these villains not only getting a hero turn in some cases but also showing that they're not, entirely, their bad actions. In particular, I thought Floyd/Deadshot being both a murderous killer <i>and</i> a very dedicated father was a really interesting turn on his character; I also enjoyed seeing Harley's secret desire being having a family with the Joker, so naturally what I'd <i>really</i> like to see is Harley/Deadshot with a family focus. How would they get together? How would Harley react to Deadshot's daughter? What would happen when the Joker or Batman got word of this? 

I only want Deadshot/Harley in terms of pairings, but I'm open to them having been with other people in the past. I'm also fine with villains being villains, or if you want to make them turn over a new leaf, that's fine too. I'm just interested in the journey.

Crazyhead (TV) 
Raquel Francis, Suzanne (Crazyhead), Amy (Crazyhead)

Crazyhead is a show that's so short but <i>so good</i>! I'm a huge fan of the entire female cast and would love more adventures together, especially post-canon since it doesn't seem like we'll ever see a Season 2. How did Suzanne come back to life after throwing herself out of the window? How do Raquel and Amy patch up their relationship after the distrust and the drugging etc? Are the demons still gunning for them, now that Callum is gone? 

I love any combination of the main three here, whether it's gen or shippy.

NieR: Automata (Video Game) 
2B (NieR: Automata), 9S (NieR: Automata), A2 (NieR: Automata), Anemone (NieR: Automata)

NieR is a game I didn't think would punch me as hard in the feels as it did. I'm really fascinated by its androids, still fighting an endless war for the sake of and against a people that no longer exist. Mostly I feel terrible for the main cast, who are all so traumatized. A part of me wants happier fluff, and another part of me wants to revel in sadness, so whether fluff or dark-fic, you'll make me happy. Mostly I'm looking for the connections between the characters nominated - How do their relationships grow and change, especially with so much going on around them? How does 2B react to killing 9S and seeing him, again and again and again? How does Anemone react to re-meeting A2? How does Anemone see the YorHa units - or  A2? How does 9S start to see the world once his sanity starts slipping - particularly 2B, A2, and Anemone? 

In terms of ships, I prefer 2B/9S and A2/Anemone, but I am open to gen for all as well.

What I'd really love is a story where Duncan and Owen make out, could be that summer - Duncan's never been kissed, and wants to practice before he tries it on Susanna - or Duncan could come back to work another summer at the park. I also really love the found family vibe of the park employees, and would be into some sort of \"it takes a village to raise a child\" story about Caitlin and her baby.

Northern Exposure 
Chris Stevens, Ed Chigliak, Holling Vincoeur, Shelly Tambo

I would really love something that goes even more into the magical realism of the show (double, triple the strange magical things! Go full-out Night Vale! Actually going full-out Night Vale with it is something I would be SUPER into). Character-wise, if you wanted to get kind of epistolary with Chris - like radio show excerpts mixed into the narrative - that would be amazing. I would also be excited about a Chris/Ed of any sort, gen Chris+Ed having some sort of adventure (maybe a road trip?), or Shelly/Holling just because I find them adorable together.

I saw this for the first time a few months ago and thought, \"I need fix-it fic where Mitch dies instead of Annie, and Annie goes with Melanie at the end.\" This could be Annie+Melanie friendship, or Annie/Melanie. (Sorry, Mitch, it's not like you're horrible or anything but I was annoyed that Annie died saving your sister.) Other ideas: I didn't nominate Mitch, but if you felt like writing Annie/Melanie/Mitch, I would be down with that. Or any of the tropes listed in my letter, really, as long as Annie doesn't die!

2) Reuben's \"I have some remaindered furniture I want to send you\" screams sugar daddy to me. Please tell me more about his relationships with Danny and Rusty when they were younger. Platonic or sexual/romantic, it doesn't matter to me.
3) \"the thing with the guy in the place\" - What did Danny and Rusty do for Reuben in Belize? Maybe only Rusty had to go to Belize for the thing, and Danny was doing his part somewhere else? Did they con someone, steal something, or maybe steal something back? I doubt Reuben is one to tell people he owes them lightly, so it must have really been something.

Really, if you're not entirely comfortable writing the Napoleonic era version of these guys, an AU of any sort would be great. (How about Jack Aubrey as Danny Ocean? I'm only slightly joking.) Either Jack/Stephen or Jack+Stephen as friends devoted to each other works for me, and if you'd also like to include Diana that would also be cool.

Chronicles of Amber - Roger Zelazny 
Corwin (Chronicles of Amber), Deirdre (Chronicles of Amber)

I'm very fond of Corwin as narrator and in general, and I really wished we could have gotten more of Deirdre than canon gave us (and I hate only realizing I ship something when one half abruptly dies!) so I would be delighted to receive a story that focuses on them, or on one of them with the other in a supporting role. With all those centuries, even before Corwin's stint as an amnesiac on Earth there's a lot of time canon didn't cover or barely glossed over in which adventures, learning experiences and heartbreaks must have been happening. 

I would rather not receive a story focusing heavily on Deirdre's canonical death-- stories set before then or handwaving it would be my preference at this time.

Gen or het with their current/past partners is fine.

I don't see these two in a romantic light, and I don't see either one as they type to cheat on their mates. But if they happened to meet before they were mated, then I could see them having a fling. Nothing serious, though, and I think it would largely be about the two of them testing one another for dominance. Or possibly Asil testing Bran (somehow I see Asil as younger, but who even knows if that's true).

A roadtrip lecture tour, with all the joys of Victorian travel. One or more of them meets the Quacks-version of another famous Victorian. Sharing wildly over the top stories about what they did during the war. Caroline and Robert's wedding night, which goes as well as expected. They're invited to a party at Nicola's new house. The zombie apocalypse happens, and none of them are taking it as seriously as they should. It's Christmas and there might be ghosts, but it could just be drugs.

Hark! A Vagrant 
Dr. Sara Josephine Baker (Hark! A Vagrant)

I agonized over whether to nominate this under Hark! A Vagrant (which is, after all, the only reason I ever found out about Dr. Sara Josephine Baker in the first place) or as some kind of RPF fandom (since it's the real-life details from her wikipedia page that REALLY ignited my interest in a possible yuletide story!). In the end I decided to nominate under Hark! A Vagrant mostly because I didn't feel like I could come up with a sensible RPF category/label. :-P

So! IN ADDITION to all the awesome public health accomplishments of Dr. Baker that we learn about in the comic, wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Josephine_Baker#Personal_life) also tells me that she lived with two other women, one of whom 'identified as a \"woman-oriented woman.\"' !!!!!  So naturally I'm interested in the possibility of a Sarah Josephine Baker/Ida Alexa Ross Wylie/Louise Pearce threesome (in whatever romantic/sexual/platonic configuration may be pleasing to you to write :-)).

I'm not an expert on the relevant history or anything--I pretty much just know what's in the comic and the wikipedia page--so, uh, don't feel any need to be any more \"historically accurate\" than the comic itself. :-P If you want to go for the same kind of tone as the comic, that's cool! If you are a secret expert in the history, I will admire! If you'd be interested in exploring some other kind of setting or approach entirely (ex.: lesbian public health doctor in SPAAAAAACE)--also cool!

Beautiful Losers II - Jack Vettriano 
Woman (Beautiful Losers II), Standing Man (Beautiful Losers II), Seated Man (Beautiful Losers II)

You can see this artwork here! https://www.jackvettriano.com/exhibitions/lovers-strangers/beautiful-losers-ii-3/

This picture just tells such a story, doesn't it? I'd love to see more of it. :-)

Threesomes are my jam. This doesn't necessarily *have to* be a sexy threesome story, but that would be very welcome if you are so inclined! Whether they're already all three in an established relationship together, or a couple bringing in a friend as a third (and if so, which pair are the couple!), or some other possibility is up to you. I do have a fondness for some degree of established relationship--the comfortableness with each other that that can bring--but I have certainly also read reams of fanfic about first times, so I'm not exactly opposed to that, either. :-)

I will say, from the body language it seems like the woman might not be entirely happy to be there... but I do prefer my threesomes happy, or at least in overall happy relationships even if the immediate situation isn't happy. Maybe she could be upset about something else, and they could be comforting her? Or something else--you don't need to feel wedded to the idea that she's unhappy at all--I just wanted to mention my take on what seemed like it might be an obvious interpretation of the picture.

Request 4 by Age or Wizardry (ageorwizardry)
Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Marge Sherwood

Consider Marge. Consider how Marge is absolutely right about Tom Ripley in the end. Consider how no one will believe her because the old boys' club would rather draw together to protect even someone who murdered one of its own sons than take a woman seriously. Consider Marge returning home from Europe, grieving, betrayed. Consider what she does next. Consider how she picks the pieces of her life back up again.

Consider the book she's been writing since before she ever met Tom Ripley, or even Dickie Greenleaf. Consider what kind of book she might be working on, what work she would consider so important—and take it seriously, because she does, even if no one else does. Consider whether the direction of her work would change after her experiences in Europe, and if so, how.

Consider her eventually being vindicated about the nature of Tom Ripley. Or, alternately, consider her living so well that he recedes ever smaller in the rear-view mirror of her life.

Consider Marge.

And then tell me something about her.

This request is primarily based on the movie, but I have read the books as well (although it was several years ago now). Feel free to incorporate or disregard anything you wish from the books—for instance, we know what Marge's book is about in the books, but there's no need for that to be the same in the movie/your story, unless you want it to be.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) 
Bella (Hunt for the Wilderpeople)

I really enjoyed this movie, but I was disappointed that it was Yet Another Story whose plot was kicked off by a woman's death. I'd love to see an AU where Bella didn't die--and whether their ordinary lives continue together on the upward trend you could expect, or they still (somehow??) manage to wind up in some of the wacky adventures they have in the movie is up to you. Or pre-movie Bella backstory--or whatever takes your fancy! I'd just love for Bella to have more room to breathe in a story that doesn't treat her as expendable.

The Alexandria Archives (Podcast) 
Morning Wood (Alexandria Archives), Gore (Alexandria Archives)

If you're new to this fandom, the Alexandria Archives is a fun cute podcast that's basically a college AU of the Cthulhu Mythos (alexandriaarchives.com) and it's an easy listen if you'd like to check it out!

I really like Morning Wood but I hate her DJ call name so I'd love something explaining it or telling us what MW's real name is, haha.

I'd also be pleased with a day in the life of Gore, vampire, not really on campus. What does he do with his days (or nights?) What's up with his \"Canadian\" roommate? How is he doing shaking off his ex? When we last left her she seemed a bit jealous of MW — although also they both liked each other. Does she have a reason to be jealous? (I'd love MW/Gore if you're so inclined!)

Alternately anything exploring the school and its background and its cast of creepy characters and landmarks would be great. You can build on any of the story-within-a-story of the individual eps (that first episode with the sever room, for example!!!! or the SWAMP), or follow any of the other characters around — really, it's all good!

Once on this Island - Flaherty/Ahrens 

I love this musical, it's one of my all-time favorites, and I'd love absolutely anything you chose to do with the mythology, the worldbuilding, or any of the characters! Want to turn all the characters into plants? Be my guest! Want to explore the antics of the gods and goddesses? Great. Want to show a conversation between Timoune and Papa Ge as she bargains to keep her life? Perfect. Want to explore what happens to the girl and boy at the end of the story who are set free by Timoune's sacrifice to love and unite the island? I would be overjoyed. &lt;3333 Even if you just want to do a look at the customs and the traditions of the people on the island, or a character study, or something experimental, or anything that's not particularly plotty — seriously, anything. I'd be delighted.

I feel like I ask for this fandom every other year I've done Yuletide, haha, and I really just would love it if someone else who loves it too comes along and cares to extend a lovely story and/or a gorgeous fascinating universe a bit further.

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

So basically I just want Alex and Dr. Strand fighting and fucking, in no particular order.

But, it would be a cool bonus if Alex has to actually deal with the conflict of interest she courts by falling in love with the subject of her reporting, because the extent to which she's willing to muddy personal/ethical lines on this show drives me crazy, haha.

Also another thing that drives me crazy about this show is the extent to which it has inverted the concepts of 'open-mindedness' and 'skepticism' by having Alex constantly comment that she is skeptical of the ability with which Strand easily explains away things she herself doesn't understand. That! is not! how skepticism works! He is easily dismissive of things because there's no practical/physical/tangible evidence for them which is the essence of skepticism; you don't get to be skeptical of a skeptic's skepticism when you are only basing your own observations on \"but i saw X happen with my own eyes\" even if it is scary and impressive and convincing! and, like, oh my god, this drives me batty. I just want him to like explain the scientific method to her until she gets it. Maybe while eating her out.

Alternately, i would love to see more of *her* skepticism and critical thinking on display, maybe in a follow-up to the end of S2? But in the end, I'm really not picky about the details or where in the timeline it takes place; I just really want Alex and Dr. Strand fucking and fighting, in no particular order. :D

Early Edition 
Gary Hobson, Marissa Clark, Toni Brigatti, Zeke Crumb

NOTE: Though I've requested all four nominated characters, with this character set I'm fine with you leaving one or two of them out, or giving one or two of the characters less screentime than your main focus. Gary and Marissa are my OTBFFs, Gary/Toni = OTP of my 14-year-old heart, and Crumb interacting with any or all of those three is always gold. The fact that the show never had Toni and Marissa together for more than three forking seconds is a damn tragedy. So seriously, any combination will work.

I'll always love a story in which Gary and Marissa negotiate how to take care of the paper and run the bar and have personal lives while being occasionally exasperated BFFs (while, meanwhile, Crumb both does and does not want to know how Gary predicts the future). I would never object to bantery romance and/or sexytimes between Gary and Toni. You could give them all a paper-based problem or one of Toni's or Crumb's cases to tackle (or a heist!) if you want to go with something plotty. 

DNWs are rape and non-consensual sex, abuse or serious harm of children, graphic violence, major character death, and depictions of real-life tragedies. See my letter for more details and prompts.

In Plain Sight 
Mary Shannon, Marshall Mann

Partnership is the best ship, and US Marshals make for fascinating partners. I would love an episodic story about Mary and Marshall and one or more of their witnesses getting into and/or out of trouble, an exploration of a trope like a road trip, bed sharing, trapped in a small space, or even an AU like a noir detective story or a time loop fic. I also would not object to a fix-it fic that repairs the damage the finale did to their friend/partner ship. Whether or not you want to make them romantic partners is up to you—I'm okay with them being BFFs forever, or with their friendship growing into something more romantic.

Feel free to include other characters from the show if you'd like, especially Stan, but I'd prefer the focus be on Mary and Marshall.

What was she like as a child; what stories did she imagine and play at with her brothers? How did Neverland change her? What pearl does she make of the bit of grit left in her by her adventure there? Can she fly without Peter's help afterward? Does she find her way back to Neverland, or to other imaginary realms as she grows up? Does she grow up and work for the better world she can imagine? Go as wildly off-canon as you want for this request and do whatever you want to give Wendy a better, happier story.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Bedivere (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I don't need all three characters to appear together, just any two! My letter has general likes, as well as a Arthur/Mage smut prompt, if you want more details than are in these prompts.

Arthur &amp; Bedivere: Bedivere comparing Arthur to Uther, developing respect between the two of them. Sparring? Would not be opposed to past Bedivere/Uther and how that affects Bedivere’s interactions with Arthur.

Bedivere &amp; The Mage: Bedivere knew who she was/that she was coming. What did he know? How did he know she was coming? What were those first weeks like, as they were planning the rescue? How did the Mage settle into the rebellion?

Bedivere &amp; Arthur &amp; The Mage: some early Table difficulties! I can see Bedivere and the Mage being the most important advisors to Arthur as he’s getting started, since Bedivere was in charge of the rebellion and was a high ranking knight in Uther’s army and the Mage is obviously an expert in a field with not a lot of experts. Something about Bedivere’s experience with the Dark Lands and him telling the two of them about it? 

Arthur/Mage, SFW: He let her bite him with a snake. What else would he let her do? Any explorations of that trust, or post-movie anything about her getting a seat at the Table would be great.

General likes and smut prompts are in my letter. Otherwise, here are a few of my prompts!

Dorothy/Lucas: during or post-canon, or canon-AU. I’m still peeved that Dorothy wasn’t the Beast Forever, so anything that switched that up so she is would be greatly appreciated! The return to Oz, the awkward first night. Lucas’ thoughts while he’s strung up. Anything, really!

West/Tip: anything to do with assuming the throne and having to be Ozma when he’s in public, West as the loyal right hand witch.

Dorothy &amp; West: witchy bonding? magic worldbuilding?

Tip &amp; Lucas: Did Tip send Lucas to retrieve Dorothy? I’d love to see how that went down. Did Lucas ask to be sent after Dorothy? Was West the one who sent him?

Lucas &amp; West: this is kind of a wildcard to me! did they know each other pre-series? how does West feel about Glinda’s hypocrisy in having a husband? do Lucas and West bond over being happiest when they have someone to serve?

General DNWs: on-screen/gratuitous/explicit rape, trauma to eyes or teeth, pregnancy, kid-fic, de-aging, crack, mpreg, A/B/O, kink treated like part of the structure of the world, mundane AUs, Christmas

General likes and some smut prompts are in my letter. I would love to read about Anderson playing off of any other character, so I've only requested her, but would be happy to have her interacting with anyone! And if you just want to Anderson on her own, I'd love case-fic! Her first case by herself, maybe? Or her backstory/the discovery of her powers/her time in Academy?

Anderson &amp; MaMa: Anderson doesn’t believe in ghosts but Madeline Madrigal haunts her all the same. Is it guilt? A psychic imprint of her last moments? Up to you!

Anderson &amp; Dredd: case-fic, or post-case fic. Patching up each other’s wounds. Dealing with psychic migraines during a case. Being teamed up together after a while apart and Dredd’s unsurprised and (seemingly) unimpressed at how much Anderson’s improved because he totally expected her to but she wants him to be proud anyway and doesn’t realize that he is?

Anderson &amp; Clan Techie: I’d be interested in a follow-up – how do they think about each other? if you want this to be shippy, i’m not opposed, but I’m thinking more along the lines of Anderson had to do a lot of killing, and the Techie is one person she was able to save, and the Techie probably remembers her. Do they meet again? Do they want to? this would be a more introspective fic, i think, though i’d love it if you could work it around action/daily life. I don’t think there’s a lot of time to stop and think and decompress in Mega City One.

Legion (TV) 
David Haller

Gen or any pairings are fine!

- What the fuck happened to David after the season finale?? Whose weird floaty metal ball prison thing was that and where did it take him?

- Division 3 can't be the only ones out there investigating and experimenting on mutants. How about a classic X-Men mutants-on-the-run kind of story but with this group of weirdos with mostly impractical abilities.

- David has the potential to do amazingly fucked up shit with his powers. What happens when he discovers his true potential? What if he enjoys the power a bit too much? Maybe he decides he can compromise with the Shadow King instead of defeat him, or maybe David consumes Farouk and loses control with their combined power. Just how much damage can he cause and is he even aware that he's doing it?

- David meets his father. I actually can't imagine what would happen if this version of David met either movie version of Xavier, but I love the idea of two of the strongest mutants in this universe - a father and son who don't even know each other - finally meeting. I figure either shit will go horribly wrong and/or they'll find a way to work things out.

Sense8 (TV) 
Lito Rodriguez, Sun Bak, Will Gorski, Wolfgang Bogdanow

I only requested a few characters, but I'm happy with any of the cluster, any pairings, any rating level. Feel free to bring in any of the supporting cast too, but I'd prefer the focus be on at least one of the cluster. I'm good with happily ever after or something more melancholy - including outright tragedy. I'm not interested in exploring issues of real world discrimination, but sensorium vs humans would be cool. 

- How the cluster rescues Wolfgang. The season finale was fucking brutal and I want to know what the rest of their mad plan was to get Wolfgang back.

- Or if you want to break my heart (go for it!), maybe they fail and the cluster has to deal with losing one of their own. How do eight become seven (or fewer)? Hell, go all out and give me the last sensate standing, alone, without their cluster (and then my family will wonder why I'm crying on Christmas and I'll babble about beautiful tragic fanfic).

- Winter holidays with the cluster! If you're in the mood for something fluffier, I love holidays and people coming together as families of different stripes. Even if they're a world apart and come from very different traditions and religions. One of my favorite things about the show is how often they celebrate with each other: all different kinds of events and festivals where they're there for one another.

- Some ideas focused on specific characters: Sun gets her revenge, one way or another. Lito becomes the movie star he was meant to be, with Hernando and Daniela at his side. Nomi and Amanita's wedding goes off with a bang. Will and Riley rebuild their lives. Capheus climbs the political ladder, for good or ill. Wolfgang figures the best way to deal with all this organized crime nonsense is to either control it all or wash his hands of it forever, with or without Kala.

- The world thinks both Matt Murdock and the Devil of Hell's Kitchen are dead. How does anyone come back from this? In other words, either about the Defenders moving on without him or literally about his return from the supposed dead.

- Matt and Jessica are the best snarky assholes. They decide to put their respective skills to good use together to save a person/their fiends/the city. Eye rolling and ass kicking ensue. I'm imagining gen here, but I'm open to being sold on them ending up in bed together (I can totally picture Jessica mocking the devil costume while trying to get Matt out of it)!

- You can't punch your way out of all fights, but it's kind of the only thing the Defenders know how to do.

- Jessica and Luke eventually figure their shit out and that they are best together. [Note: I love Claire but I find Luke/Claire not very exciting so I'd ask that you break them up kindly.]

- Luke/Danny porn. Against a wall, over furniture, grabbing, biting. Super strength/invulnerability meets harnessed qi. Most likely awkward and rough, but maybe something they both need. Feel free to throw Matt in here too, why not. 

Do Not Wants: D/s, mundane/modern AUs, kidfic, pregnancy, incest, 2nd person POV, soulbonds/soulmates, jealousy, A/B/O, spanking, issuefic.

Goon (2011) 
Xavier LaFlamme, Doug Glatt

There just isn't that much shippy fic about these two - I'm all in for fluffy romance or smut, I'm not fussy.  I haven't included Eva as a required character but I am happy for her to be included in a poly triad or full on OT3 or not as the filler chooses.

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 
Corran Horn (Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types)

This was my very first fandom and I fondly recall reading fanfic of it back in the day but so little seems to have survived.  Corran was always my favourite character and I'd love to read anything involving him, especially anything during the events of the Allston books when the canonical focus moves to the Wraiths - we get a couple of anecdotes about Corran but it would be good to read more.  Or anything involving his recovery from being held on the Lusankya, which gets glossed over in the books.

Washington Capitals RPF 
Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

Backstrom is my favourite player on the Caps - he doesn't get the limelight like some other players but he's always there getting the job done.  I would probably be happy with anything involving him but something shippy with another Caps player would be great.  I don't have a long list of DNW but must have a happy ending, no ongoing infidelity or bashing of real life relationships and no non-hockey AUs.  I'm totally good with ABO and similar type AUs and I absolutely love magical realism done with these guys.

Vegas Golden Knights RPF 
Marc-Andre Fleury (Vegas Golden Knights RPF), James Neal (Vegas Golden Knights RPF)

As sad as am I for Flower to have left the Penguins, at least Vegas seem to have got off to a good start.  Since Flower and Neal have been reunited in Vegas and both seem to be starting off hot, I'd love a story about them helping each other adjust.  Would be happy with gen but something of a more shippy, or even smutty nature, would be great.  If smutty, would prefer if real life relationships were acknowledged but no cheating (open relationship, one-off agreement, or whatever).  I love the narrative about Flower being a prankster and references to this would be an added bonus.  I just want fic which shows him settling into Vegas and being happy there - he deserves it.

The Bold Type 
Jane Sloan, Ryan Decker

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

The Bold Type (Jane Sloan &amp; Ryan Decker)
I let friends and a barrage of Facebook ads talk me into starting this show and I fell in love with it, and with Jane Sloan specifically. I love that things scare her and embarrass her, but she does them anyway (and then writes something honest and heartfelt about it). I love her friendship with Kat and Sutton, so feel free to include them and any other characters from the show in your fic. I like Ryan, hence my requesting him, but the TBT really only shows him from Jane’s point of view, so I have a hard time really pinning him down. 

I really enjoy the two of them together, and would love to receive a fic that involves the two of them giving a serious, exclusive relationship a try. Jane clearly has a certain idea about what Ryan is looking for from a woman, but she hasn’t given him much of a chance to prove otherwise (nor has he put much effort into getting one). But what if he did want to date Jane seriously, and only date her? It seems like he at least entertained the idea. I’m sure there would be some missteps along the way, but I’d love to see them put in the effort. Maybe they have to go separate ways for a while, but run into each other years down the line and find that the attraction’s still there. Do they give it another go? Or do they give casual another shot, only to eventually find they want to be less casual, and then try to broach the topic again?

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Call the Midwife  (Trixie Franklin &amp; Christopher Dockerill)
I forget how I started watching this show, but I’ve watched the last few seasons over long weekends with my mother. I love the historical aspect (fashion! medical breakthroughs! the horrible trauma of a generation that survived World War II!), as well as the focus on women and all the different types of relationships that they have. It took me a season or two to warm up to Trixie, but as we’ve gotten to see more sides of her I’ve come to love the vulnerability that she hides under her perfectly applied eyeliner. I’ve been hoping she’ll get some sort of happy ending since she broke off her engagement to Tom, and I like the idea of Christopher being that for her. Neither one of them was entirely forthcoming about their pasts at the start of their relationship, but it was to avoid getting hurt (and in Christopher’s case, also to avoid his daughter getting hurt).

Please, please, please give me a happy ending (or middle) for these two. Whether it’s a sweet holiday interlude (I love the show’s Christmas episodes, but I’m also in for any other holiday), or something that has them both opening up a little more about their pasts (Trixie’s childhood and alcoholism, and Christopher’s divorce), and not letting that get in the way of their future. I’d love to see more of Trixie getting used to the idea of being in a relationship with a man who has a child. Trixie was really great with Alexandra during their first meeting, but things aren’t always that easy or pleasant when there’s a child involved. Alternately, I think there could be a lot to explore by having Christopher be formally introduced to the rest of the nuns and midwives. I love all of the canon pairings on the show, so feel free to include them, but I’d like the focus to be on Trixie and Christopher.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Emerald City  (Dorothy Gale &amp; Lucas/Roan)
Oh man, this show sucked me in from the first episode and I was so sad to hear that it was canceled. I love tv shows/books/movies that take a well-known story and twist it up, and this was no exception. At the start, Dorothy was so clearly thrown off-kilter by being sent to a world with completely different rules than her own, but she learned to play by them and play by them well. I also love how emotional she could be. When something affected her, it was clear for everyone to see.

For this fandom, I’d like to see something that picks up where the show left off. I think there’s so much to explore there, with Dorothy returning to Oz and also being around Lucas/Roan again. Something that shows them trying to figure out where they stand with each other now would be much appreciated. They were lovers and they were enemies, and they very nearly killed each other. How do they reconcile that? Is he Lucas or is Roan or is he some combination of both of them now? Where are his loyalties now? Can they trust each other? So much of their relationship is completely up in the air and can go down so many different paths. It’s exciting to think about. I also really loved both of their relationships with Sylvie, so feel free to include her.

Orphan Island - Laurel Snyder (Abigail)
I am a children’s librarian and I read this book for a committee I’m on at work. I wouldn’t say that I like the way it was open ended and mysterious, but I loved the book and the unanswered questions have definitely been circling around in my head since I finished. I will give Laurel Snyder a lot of credit, because usually books like this annoy me rather than intrigue me.

So I’d love to have your take any of the many unanswered questions. Who was Abigail, where was she from, and what happened to her? How did the first children end up on the Island? Where to the children start out from before coming to the Island, and where do they end up afterwards? Is there a purpose to the Island? How does the Island manage to provide the children with everything they need (at least until it’s rules are broke, and then how does it know the rules have been broken)? I know I requested Abigail, but if you’d like to focus on any other character or just give me worldbuilding, you do not need to include her.

Provost's Dog - Tamora Pierce 
Sabine of Macayhill (Provost's Dog)

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Provost’s Dog - Tamora Pierce (Sabine)
I’ve been reading Tamora Pierce’s books since I was a kid, and about two years ago I did a re-read of everything she’s written. I wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the Provost’s Dog trilogy when it originally came out, but the second time around I got so much out of it. As an adult, I loved seeing the Tortall of the past, as well as all these events/trends/movements/etc that created the Tortall we see in Pierce’s other books.

Sabine in particular is a great example of this. We tend to think that as time moves forward society gets more progressive, but Sabine is a lady knight in a society that is becoming more narrow in its gender roles. It would be fantastic to receive something that explores that more. How does the Cult of Gentle Mother affect her life as a knight, or even her life farther down the line when she’s put down her sword? How does it affect women knights as a whole? Alternately, something that shows Sabine processing/recovering from Tunstall’s betrayal and coming to terms with the inequality he saw in their relationship would be wonderful, as would something showing her relationships with Bekah and/or Clary in the wake of this.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Wayward Children series - Seanan McGuire (any)
Oh man, I was in love with this series from the moment I first read a description. And then I was completely awed by Seanan McGuire’s handling of it, especially in regards to the worlds she created for these children to have spent time in. I found every character in this tagset so interesting, and they each have so much about them to be explored, so whoever it was that you offered and whoever it is that you ended up writing about, I’m sure I’ll love it. I’m not really interested in anything shippy with regards to this series (I don’t think I really have ships for this series), so feel free to have any characters interacting in any way. Also, this is my first time requesting ‘any’ in an exchange, so I’m sorry if I’m explaining things I shouldn’t or not explaining things that I should.

Some ideas: We’ve seen/heard in first person what Nancy and the twins’ worlds were like, so I’d love to see or hear more about where Loriel, Christopher, Eleanor, and Kade went. That could be done set in their first trips to those worlds, or because one of them finds a portal back, or whatever interests you. I’d also love to see an alternate universe in which Loriel does make it back to her world. We know the Spider Queen mourned her for a long time; what was their relationship like? What happens to Jack, Jill, and/or Nancy now that they’re back in the worlds they longed for? Is it different now that things are permanent, now that they have a more concrete understanding of where they are and how they got there and where they were from?

Hello author! I'm out of the country without good internet access until Oct 23rd, so I will probably not be able to get a proper author's letter up until then (sorry!!). However, I've requested RW in previous Yuletides and nothing in those letters will change significantly (including dnws), so if you want to start working off those it's perfectly fine by me!

Mary mother of Jesus had a hard life to live. Tell me about that. Tell me about her relationships with her son and with the women (including the song's narrator) who supported her.

Alternately: \"slivers of the goddess that they never let us see\" is the line that most strikes me in this song. In a polytheistic world, where apotheosis is not unheard of (and may well be how Mary's mortal son got to be a god in the first place), who was Mary, and who did she become?

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Erasmus (Captive Prince), Torveld (Captive Prince)

The Captive Prince series is freaking amazing. So many feels! Erasmus should get all the hugs and comfort he wants; he seriously deserves to be happy, and Torveld is the kind of master who would treat him well and actually care. Erasmus and Torveld were just so sweet together when they showed up, even if we didn't get to see enough of them in canon. How are they going to feel about what happened in Kings Rising when they find out about everything? How will post-canon political changes affect their relationship? Missing (sexy, if you’re into that) scenes from during the canon timeline would be cool, too. :) Please no Erasmus/Kallias except as something that happened in the past.

I’d be happy if Damen and Laurent showed up in disguise somehow, if that’s something you wanted to do and it made any sense at all with the plot. An exception to my crossdressing DNW is crossdressing disguises, which are fun and also canon here. Charls showing up would also be welcome if you’re into that. Speaking of fun canon things, anything with Erasmus' musical talent would be great, too. I bet Torveld would be totally into it if Erasmus wrote him a song. ^_^

Shades of Magic - V. E. Schwab 
Holland Vosijk, Kell Maresh

The world!! Actually, the world<i>s</i>. I love the worldbuilding and magic in this series. I want more of it! There’s so much to explore when you have four Londons: this series has dimension-hopping <i>and</i> people with enough angst to fill multiple universes. Both the characters and the universe(s) themselves are just super-compelling. I so haven’t seen enough of Kell or Holland yet, and I definitely haven’t seen enough of them interacting. I ship those two a lot. They have a fascinating dynamic where they’re antagonistic and have completely different viewpoints but can’t help relating to each other on some level because they’re the last <i>Antari</i> left. Also fascinating is the potential to (mis)use <i>Antari</i> magic for sexy purposes. (It’s a very “your mileage may vary” kink, but I’d totally be into magic-enabled bloodplay here.) 

Being <i>Antari</i> seems to mean being a complete mess, psychologically. With great power comes great angst! Especially with <i>A Conjuring of Light</i>. It was awesome getting to see Holland and Kell working together, but that ending was so sad! I would be more than happy if you came up with an alternate ending where neither of them was damaged by that Inheritor (I knew it was going to be bad when it showed up!) and Holland doesn’t die. Please no Kell/Lila, and I’d prefer Lila not show up.

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Hiraga Josef Kou, Lauren Di Luca, Roberto Nicholas

I’m not even sure how to describe the show, but Scooby Doo: Vatican Edition is one alternate title I saw, and it’s totally appropriate. It could also be called WTF Vatican: The Show. It’s total cracky fun. So many wild plot twists of the “did that actually happen? Yes, it did,” variety. I don’t know how sensible the IT dungeon is (yes there’s what can only be described as the Vatican IT Dungeon), but it’s sure fun. Amidst all the crack and WTF plots, there’s a lot of heartfelt feelings, too. Heartfelt feelings and more cocaine than you might expect for a show about priests (who are basically married or want to be, in my eyes - Lauren is <i>so</i> very jealous of Roberto and Hiraga).

I just love the way Hiraga and Roberto work together and bounce off each other and obviously care about each other. I also love the idea of Lauren’s frustrated, bitter crush on Hiraga. And Lauren’s interactions with Roberto. Casefic would be awesome, and so would anything hurt/comfort. There’s so much potential for feelings between Roberto and Hiraga and also physical danger that causes or reveals feelings. (Sex pollen would be an excellent reason for hurt/comfort.) Speaking of feelings, I’m into the ideas where everyone assume Hiraga and Roberto are in a relationship and Hiraga is completely oblivious.

Luke Snyder

I'm a super cliche shipper of Luke/Reid. I love the pairing and I still resent the way the show ended. That being said,&nbsp; I would love a 'Train? What train?' story, or something during their (admittedly bumpy) courtship. I would also be happy with a more gen Luke-centered story. I would prefer that Luke's alcoholism not be a main focus of the story unless you have a good grasp of addiction &amp; recovery. But if you DO have those things, then incorporating Luke's recovery would be cool. I also like his relationships with his younger siblings.

Call the Midwife 

The thing I love most about this show are the relationships and the way that Nonnatus House is a source of help &amp; hope in Poplar. If you're moved to do a well researched historical look at a social issue (as the series often does), that would be cool. But honestly, I'd be just as pleased with a cheerful slice-of-life. I would be happy with a gen story, but if you choose to include a relationship, I enjoy the canon relationships of Chummy/Peter,&nbsp; Tom/Barbara, Shelagh/Patrick and Patsy/Delia. I don't especially care for Tom/Trixie (I simply didn't think they were well suited), so if your story is set during their romance, I would prefer it not be the main focus. I know that there is a lot of angst &amp; drama in the source material, but I prefer that this story be at least hopeful.

Machineries of Empire Series - Yoon Ha Lee 
Vahenz afrir dai Noum, Liozh Zai

So, this is a great fandom if you're into terrifying competent people, and Vahenz is up there on the list. Her reports are a constant source of glee: so chatty, so scattered with (possibly totally fake!) personal details -- and so full of references to her interactions with Zai. Nothing I fall for quite like a pairing of a ruthless idealist and an equally ruthless schemer. I love the idea of Vahenz seducing Zai (politically and otherwise) and somewhere along the way catching feelings, but knowing all along that if anything goes wrong she'll have to kill Zai to minimize damage and wondering whether Zai knows it, too. I also, for as little pagetime comparatively as she gets, find Zai endlessly fascinating: the deadly serious Liozh roleplaying! The actual devotion to democracy! I really want to know more about what's up with her world view, her approach to politics, etc. 

Assorted prompts: First meeting, Vahenz's first attempts to incite Zai to heresy? Vahenz giving Zai pointers on public relations? The two of them arguing about the new calendar? I can see Zai sticking at how limited their changes are, such as not being able to get rid of remembrances. How about the moment Zai decided she'd had enough? 

Generally I'm up for any Fortress of Scattered Needles interpersonal drama. If you're looking for side characters to include, I'm particularly interested in Nirai Faian and her and Iruja's experiments.

The Divine Cities Series - Robert Jackson Bennett 
Shara Komayd, Turyin Mulaghesh

So, right, funny story about me and these books: very early on in City of Stairs I made a mistake. The moment Shara met Mulaghesh, my genre senses (and/or my id?) said, Ah, the Local Authority that the Dashing Spy is working with/against, I know my spy genre, clearly here we have the Love Interest! Excellent! I was... wrong! It took me longer than I'm comfortable admitting to work out that I was wrong, and by then is was way too late for me not to ship it fervently. That exchange in Blades about Mulaghesh succeeding by being extremely obnoxious was very good for me. 

So... what I'd like is version where I'm not wrong: all the weird manipulative romance between prickly, competent women working together. Whether you go AU during Stairs, write something set between Stairs and Blades, or something set after Blades, I'll be happy. Some other favorite characters, if it helps, are Signe, Ivanya, and Olvos.

The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi 

This canon is one of the most gloriously id-satisfying things I've ever read: space opera, heists, intertextuality with the Arsène Lupin stories, a main character being dragged kicking and screaming into redemption. I finished rereading the books just before nominations closed and scrambled to pick the four best characters to facilitate an \"any\" request. What I'm after is post-canon fic: in particular, everything about Sirr's future. How do its politics shake out in this new setting? The Sobornost are obviously no longer an issue, but internal politics are still there, and there will be new opportunities for the jinn, with access to zoku tech. Use whatever combination of characters calls out to you! I have specific prompts for them in my letter. 

DNW: permanent memory loss*; plotless fluff; mundane/setting change AUs

*this is a consistent DNW but it occurs to me it's a little fraught for this fandom. What I'm against here is a story that ends in \"and then they forgot everything that happened!\" so. As long as you avoid that, it's all good.

Completely Optional Prompts: 

As far as I'm concerned, there can never be enough stories exploring the wider world of the Blade movies, particularly the Nightstalker network. How does Whistler senior go about setting it up, and how does Abby get involved?  How does Abigail and King's cell fit in with the wider Nightstalkers' network? Are they the main cell? R&amp;D? The misfits?

In one of the codas at the end of the movie, seen in the extended version, the vampires have been wiped out by DayStar and Abby and King are now hunting werewolves with Caulder, with the suggestion that the werewolves they're hunting have somehow been vampirised.  Tell me about that, whether it's how they move into werewolf hunting, or about one hunt in particular.

What happens when a hunt goes wrong? What if Abby's hurt? Or King?

Do they ever have to go undercover to find their mark? Troll night clubs looking for vampire lairs? Haunt metro networks or street corners?

Do they ever take the night off? What does downtime look like to a vampire hunter?

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story).

Completely Optional Prompts: 

It looks like we won't be getting any more Emerald City (sad face) so I'm all about fic that picks up where the series left off. 

What happens when Lucas comes for Dorothy? Does she go back to Oz with him? Does she not?  Do they face the Beast Forever and defeat it, save her mother?

What about Lucas's relationship with Glinda? Is he still torn between being Roan and being Lucas?  Why did Jane send him, or did she? Is it a trap?

Or, how did Lucas make the decisions he did that led to him trying to kill Dorothy? Was it simply the power that Glinda exerts, or something deeper that that? Something of Roan?

What about Dorothy? Was it grief or rage or something else that had her literally putting Lucas back where she found him?

How do they move past it? Do they? Or does it get buried under the weight of things they have to go, a silent tension between them while they do what needs to be done?

What about Toto? Does he make go back to Oz, too?

Other things you might want to know: I have read all of the Oz books, but that was many, many moons ago when I was wee.

I love how Button tries so hard to live up to their expectations of him, how he's itching to do more, but how he's still a child in many ways - trusting and impatient both at once. I love Charley's big brother like exasperation, and Boss's barely hidden affection, as rough and ready as the man himself. And how eager Button is for that praise, the need for validation.

Just anything about this little family - before the movie or after it - would be great.

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> The only reason I haven't also selected Sue is because I don't want to limit you to a post-movie fic. But if you want to include her, I'd be really happy with that. And if you do want to set it pre-movie, feel free to include Mose. 

No slash or underage sex for this fandom, please. Thank you.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story). No death fic, although I'm okay with a story dealing with the aftermath if it happened in canon.

Sólo quiero caminar | Just Walking (2008) 
Aurora Rodriguez, Gabriel (Sólo quiero caminar)

Please see my letter for information on why I love this fandom in particular, and wider info on my likes and dislikes.  I ship my chosen characters, but it's okay if you don't :)

Completely Optional Prompts: 

Can I just say one thing - why the hell does no one in this movie ever think to call a bloody ambulance? I mean, I get the aesthetic, but frankly if you've got time for a dramatically slow death scene, full of conversations with loved ones, then you've got time to call an ambulance.

So let's call one, yeah?  

So what I want is fix-it fic. No one dies. They escape. They carry out more crimes. They're avenging angels for the abused women and children of the world. Gloria sees her kid grow up and Paloma isn't forced into that weird thing of raising a teenager who's got a crush on each other.  Gabriel and Aurora actually learn about each other. Maybe they're all on the run from the mob. Maybe they aren't. Where do they go from here?

That's really what I want, but feel free to elaborate however you like on that bare-bones request :D

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> I'm perfectly happy if you want to include the whole gang. I'm just thoroughly intrigued by Aurora and Gabriel (and those smoking hot scenes) between them, so I'd like any story to focus on them, please.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves.

Blue Plate Special - Jeff Lee Johnson 

For this prompt: I'm pretty open to anything.  You don't have to stick to the nominated characters, you can crossover, you can do meta worldbuilding.  Pic something in the picture and tell me a story about it.  

This will be an exception to some of my general notes below in that tentacle sex is always a good thing if that's what you're about too.  Just throwing that into the mix.  You're not obligated and I'm not expecting it, just saying that if the many tentacles strike your tentacle sex fancy than that's okay.

General Notes:

After a particularly difficult year where I defaulted due to stressing out over the requests of my assignment I have adopted the philosophy that Yuletide needs to be for the writer as much as the reader.  So, I firmly believe that you should write what makes you happy.  Doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to read it, but I want you to write something you'll be happy with and that won't cause you too much stress during the next few months.  

With that in mind please do take note of the following things:

I'm not looking for smut or sex or anything above a R rating (and R is probably pushing things).  My kinks are highly specific and I'm not interested in you writing for them.  I'm just not.  If the only way you'll be happy this Yuletide is to write 1000 words of smut, then you do you.  Just understand that I most likely won't read it, but I'm giving you permission to do that.

I enjoy most every fandom trope out there, but the ones that mess with consent (AMTDI, Sex Pollen, etc).  Certain ones I'm not overly fond of (A/B/O, wing!fic, people-as-pets, things along these lines) but will enjoy an interesting deconstruction of the trope or twist on it.

Beyond that write what makes you happy.  And feel free to have the mods contact me about anything you have questions on.

Maybe they're just hanging out at the Last Dance drinking milkshakes.

If you read the Incryptid Series as well feel free to explore their relationship with each other in relation to their connections to the Price family.  I think it's interesting that they're both Price family ghosts, but they didn't interact for like 40 years.  How'd that work?

Pyre (Video Game) 
Jodariel (Pyre), The Reader (Pyre), Pamitha Theyn, The Moon-Touched Girl (Pyre)

I’d love a story that takes these characters and explores the world through them - especially the Rites. How does it feel to be in a Rite? What relationship do they have to the Reader? Or you could write about the revolution, and the Commonwealth, and how these people change the world &lt;3 Feel free to pick any mix of liberated people - whatever suits the story. I don’t have one particular solid headcanon for this game; part of what I like about it is that it feels like there are good things and bad things for any given ending for any given character.

Jodariel is the best, and I ship her like crazy with everyone. Her design is super appealing to me for one thing, with her buff arms and her horns and the way she moves in the Rites, both hulking and graceful. I love her mixture of kindness and reserve and frosty defensiveness - you can see how her history has shaped her, made her afraid and defensive, but also how incredibly kind she is. I’m up for any kind of story about her life in the Downside, but especially stories that focus on her place in the Nightwings, and how she feels about the other characters (I started to write out notes about individual relationships, realised how long it would be, and gave up. But I love all of them). Or how her life changes if she’s Liberated.

Pamitha is incredible. She’s beautiful, she’s snarky, she can fly. What’s not to love??? I really love her story with her sister, and how she begs you to lose the liberation rite against the Essence. A story about her and Tabitha would be incredible - whether they’re both liberated, only one of them is, or they both stay Downside.

The Moon-Touched Girl is great. I really like the way in which she’s odd - her perspective on reality might not be the same as other people, but it has its own internal logic. And she can be very sharp and intuitive. Her backstory hints at sadness, but it’s not the point of her character - her story is as much about her present and future as the experiences that led her to the Nightwings. I love her interactions with basically everyone - a fic about how she sees the other characters would be fantastic. Or a story about her experiences after the end of the game, especially if she is chosen in the Liberation Rite. (I called her Mae, as a nod to Night in the Woods, but give her whatever name you like for her.)

Given how much choice you have about the Reader, there’s a lot of different options. The only thing that I ask is that you make the Reader female - since I prefer my reader ships f/f. Otherwise, you can use whatever backstory you prefer. I chose the crippled scholar, and I do like the implications of the Reader being physically disadvantaged - the way that plays into their role in the Rites. But use whatever suits your feelings and story. As for story prompts: honestly, I think I’m mostly interested in fic about the Reader’s in story feelings. How do they feel about the role they were thrust into? How do they make their decisions about who to choose for Liberation? Or post-game fic about the consequences of their choices would also be fascinating.

&nbsp;

Ship-wise, I adore Jodariel/Pamitha, as a fabulous enemies-to-lovers ship (and this is one that I would be totally up for porn with - between Jodariel’s horns and Pamitha’s wings there is some really good potential, plus I could see them having a lot of fun with bondage - though who’s tying up who is a serious question). I’d love stories that tackle how they might get together, whether it’s slow burn, or a physical relationship that awkwardly dredges up feelings. (If you’re writing slow burn, don’t feel obliged to include the whole relationship. A short fic that was entirely stumbling blushes and awkward touches and the promise of something more down the line would be incredible.)

I also really like Jodariel/Moon-Touched Girl. It’s protrayed more as a familial relationship in canon, but I could easily see it becoming romantic. Though I imagine the Moon-Touched Girl would have to initiate things (and in fic with age differences, I do usually prefer the younger person to take the lead).

Jodariel/Reader is also great - partly because I am weak and Jodariel is hot, and partially because I think she’s the one of the companions who takes the most work. Getting her to open up and trust you is tricky, and I always like a puzzle that’s hard to solve. I particularly enjoy this ship as one where Jodariel is much taller and stronger than the Reader, because I am shallow.

Since I’m requesting the Reader, I’ll mention that I also really like Reader/Sandra. Obviously, Sandra wasn’t nominated, so this is very, very optional, but I did find their relationship fascinating. The tensions that exist in a situation where the Reader has all the power, Sandra’s loneliness and sarcasm and longing for companionship, the complications of not being able to touch - it is all such good stuff.

響け! ユーフォニアム | Hibike! Euphonium (Anime) 
Kousaka Reina, Oumae Kumiko

I got an absolutely wonderful gift for this fandom two years ago, but that was before season two came out, and I am weak and I want more. As much as I loved season two’s focus on family and sisterly relationships, I was a bit gutted that we didn’t get more of Reina and Kumiko. (That said, I really liked that Taki-sensei firmly rejected Reina. It was one of his best moments as a teacher, and I was so happy to see that subplot over and done with.)

I love both Reina and Kumiko separately, for different reasons. I love Reina for her overwhelming drive to succeed, and her passion, and how proud she is of her own talent. And I love Kumiko for her bluntness, and nosiness, and how she pays attention to people. And I love that she loves music, even though it takes her a bit longer to realise it. Fics that are about music - about how either or both of them relate to music, and about how it shapes and guides them through their lives would be amazing. I like to think that music is important to them for the rest of their lives.

If you’re writing shippy fic (and I ship the heck out of these two), I’d love a fic about them in college, or even later in their life. I like to imagine them both as professional musicians, eventually, and it would be really interesting to read a fic about how that plays into a romantic relationship between them. Something about them figuring out their feelings would be great - especially if there’s mutual pining. Or something about them in an established relationship, and how they juggle work and time commitments and all those other things. Reina is a genius, and while Kumiko has talent, she’s not quite at the same level, so that seems like something they might have to work around.

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price, Mary Crawford

I’m happy with both the Fanny/Edmund and Fanny/Henry, and if you want to include either in your story, I’ll enjoy them, but I have to confess that I would kill for a Fanny/Mary story that does what so many Fanny/Henry stories do, and breaks away from canon to write a different ending. I’m always a sucker for femslash, and the dynamic between Fanny and Mary is one that fascinates me. It has a lot of the same appeal as Fanny/Henry - that in falling for one of the Crawfords, Fanny truly changes her perspective on someone, and it pushes her away from the traditional Bertrams towards a more modern group of people. I also think it creates interesting tensions in Mary and Henry's relationship, and Fanny and Edmund's. On top of that, I actually really enjoy stories that are about starting relationships against the pressures of society and working out a way to be happy while dealing with repression. As long as they have happy endings. And I would ask, if you write this, that you give them a happy ending. I don't need them to be universally accepted by everyone around them, out and proud, but I would like them to be happy with each other.

* One thing that would be very interesting is to see Mary and Fanny in a completely different setting: perhaps in Mary’s London circle. I don’t think Fanny would be at all comfortable, that’s what would be so interesting.

Fanny is a great character. She’s extremely insecure, but in an incredibly relatable way, and despite her insecurity she has a will of absolute iron. She’s got a lot of insight into people, but she can also be very blind, especially as it concerns herself. And all of this is bound up in her morality. Fanny is an extremely ethical person, though her standards of ethics and morality don’t totally align with a modern perspective. I think her consistent desire to do what is right, rather than what is easy, is part of what makes her such a great character, but she doesn’t always consider other people’s perspectives, and it would be cool to see a fic that challenge some of her presumptions of the world.
* I’d love a fic where Fanny is, for whatever reason, trapped in a room making conversation with someone she would normally never talk to. Again, that idea of pushing at her boundaries a little, and exploring what her limits are, but also maybe giving her a chance to reconsider an assumption, really appeals to me. The person she’s talking to could be someone like the Admiral, Mary and Henry’s uncle, or one of Mary’s friends, or even one of the Admiral’s mistresses.
Fanny’s refusal of Mr. Crawford is one of my favourite parts of the book, even though I like fic where they do get married. That enduring and tenacious refusal is such a powerful plot point. I’d love to see fic about other times in her life when she had to draw on that stubbornness. (If you wanted to make this a ‘five times’ fic you totally could - I’m always a fan of those, but just one time would be equally interesting.)

Mary fascinates me because of the many ways in which she serves as a foil to Fanny. They’re great mirror images of each other. She’s superficially much more decisive and strong-willed than Fanny, but underneath she’s actually much more reliant on what other people think of her. In an odd way, she’s also very insecure. She really needs to be liked by other people, I think, really wants the approval of those around her. Whereas Fanny, though she feels that she doesn’t really deserve love and affection, is very good at relying on her own inner resources.
* A fic about Mary’s past, and her childhood, would be delightful. It’s only touched on very briefly in the story, but she must have had an extremely challenging childhood, between the deaths of her parents and being raised in a house with an aunt she loved and an uncle she hated. There’s a line in the book where Fanny says that Mary shouldn’t speak ill of her uncle, even though he’s not a good person, and while it’s completely true by the mores of Jane Austen’s time, I kind of love Mary for refusing to bow to those standards and pretend that her uncle is a good person when he pretty clearly isn’t.
* There’s a comparison that’s often made between Austen and Mary Crawford - that although Mary is the antagonist, she’s a lot more similar to Austen than Fanny is. I don’t entirely know how fair that is, but it did give me the idea of Mary becoming a writer like her creator, and I think that could make for a great fic. Maybe, years later, she writes about a fictionalised version of the events of Mansfield Park? It would be really interesting to see how she might revisit that story in later years, and what, if anything, she would change.

Little Witch Academia 
Atsuko \"Akko\" Kagari, Diana Cavendish

It actually took me a while to sit down and watch this anime, but I loved it to pieces when I did. It’s so creative and fun and exciting, and the characters are just so likeable.

Akko is great. One thing I really like about her is that although she can be kind of lazy and flaky and impatient, we actually see her putting in the work. She really fights for her skills, and I love every moment when her earnestness and hard-work and determination shine through. She’s so sincere and sweet. I’d love a story about her learning magic, and improving. The magic in the series is so fun and creative, and I really like the world, so just Akko studying could make for a brilliant fic.

Diana is interesting - I like her in the series a lot more than in the original OVA. I love her kindness, and her determination to do the right thing, and the walls she puts up to hide her generosity and compassion. She’s genuinely a really good person, underneath the arrogance and standoffishness. I’d be particularly interested in stories about her relationship to her family, and how she feels about her heritage. Or stories about her in the ‘normal’ world, where she can’t use her magic and has to rely on her other skills.

And of course, I adore Diana/Akko as a ship. Getting together fic would be great, or fic about them working out exactly what it is they feel for each other. The series has a lot of tropey fun with things like the love bee, and I would love a fic where maybe some magical mishaps forces them to confront feelings they might not otherwise acknowledge. I think Akko and Diana are two people who are really good for each other, and they push and challenge each other in ways that make them both better people - which I guess is the ideal.

British Government Cats RPF 
Palmerston (British Government Cats RPF)

I admit it: in the Larry vs. Palmerston feud, I am a Palmerston partisan. That doesn't mean I'm not interested in the other cats, but I'd like him to be the star of the show. Does Palmerston ever get his medal (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/768462331508625408)? Meet his tigers (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/808723549309517825)? Why does Treasury keep Gladstone,
as the Telegraph once put it, \"under lock and key,\" and can Palmerston befriend his colleague anyway? What was Freya straying in search of, and can Palmerston piece together the clues left in her absence? And what's the root of his feud with Larry, anyway?

In general, I am more interested in a story from the perspective of the cats than one from a human perspective. I would prefer no cat death (though brief references to off-screen death of OCs are fine if, e.g., you want to write some sort of mystery, as are mentions of predecessors dying from old age or similar).

If inspiration strikes you, I would love a fusion or crossover with another Yuletide-sized fandom here. Diane Duane's Cats of Grand Central series comes to mind as one obvious choice; seeing Palmerston somehow embroiled in Falcon business in a Rivers of London crossover could also be cool.

I'm also happy with something cracky. An AU where Sir Simon McDonald turns into a cat and has to be taught feline ways by Palmerston? Yes please. (I'd prefer no AUs where cats turn into humans, though.) Palmerston is appointed Ambassador to [Country] and everyone treats this as perfectly normal? Sign me up. Post-apocalyptic cat road trip? I'm on board.

Slip Slidin' Away - Paul Simon (Song) 
The Woman Who Became A Wife, The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown, The Father Who Had A Son, Delores (Slip Slidin' Away)

I am fond of songfic that takes lyrical metaphors excessively literally. Why is The Man Who Wears His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown in danger of disappearing? What's The Woman Who Became A Wife's objection to rain? What's making the road they travel so difficult to glide down? How is God involved in the whole mess? But if you'd rather be more subtle and illusive, that's cool too. 

Fantasy, science fictional, and dystopic settings are my jam. Maybe they're all time-travelers, working together to wander the twisty roads of alternate timelines and try to fix their society's their future, but always finding the result not quite as planned? (Maybe Delores lives in the past, and The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown's love jeopardizes their mission.) Maybe they've successfully defeated the Evil Overlord and are finding that bringing their kingdom back to peacetime (and finding their own happiness within it) is more complicated than anticipated. Maybe they're space travelers voyaging between unstable wormholes. 

If you're not into speculative fiction, I'm also a fan of historical/period pieces. Pick a time and place that speaks to you, and show me how these people struggle to balance their hopes and regrets. Whatever route you go, I don't expect all the characters to have equal prominence, but I would like to see the different verses connected into a single story somehow.

Tuya is Maika's best friend; she's also Maika's betrayer, and as of Volume 2 we have no idea why. I'm interested in speculation about what's going on in her head and what she's experienced since splitting up from Maika (complicated Dusk Court politics would definitely be my jam), but I'm equally intrigued by their backstory in the camps and with the Scyth. I ship the two of them, but that doesn't mean I expect them to find a happy ending--happy-for-now shippy backstory with foreshadowing to what lies ahead would be great, and I'd also be interested in something unrequited (from either side). 

If you want to include other characters, Kippa is one of my favorites, and I'm curious what she and Tuya would have to say to one another if they ever met. I'm also fascinated by Maika's relationship with her mother; what's Tuya's take on it? What was Tuya's own relationship with her parents?

Cannibalism, murder, torture, vivisection, and general mayhem on level with canon are fine, but please no rape.

Stranger Things (TV 2016) 
Nancy Wheeler, Barbara \"Barb\" Holland

This is a desperate plea for fix-it fic: I like everything about this show except for the disparity between how Barb and Will's disappearances were handled. Will's disappearance gets to be the focus of the show; Barb's, well, no one except Nancy seems to care that she's gone at all. But I care. So: show me Nancy interacting with other people who care that Barb is gone. Or give me Nancy and Barb backstory that develops Barb's character and their friendship. Or, if you're up for it, give me an AU where Barb is rescued, instead of or in addition to Will. How does her time in the Upside Down change her? How does Nancy help her re-integrate on her return? What do their lives look like, ten or twenty years later? Or what about an AU where she's never taken--maybe one where Hawkins National Laboratory rescues her, and she ends up working for/with them?

I am happy to read Nancy and Barb as platonic friends or (if they both live) as a femslash pairing. I do find the canonical pairings interesting, but they're teenagers and prone to being fickle in love; if you want to break Nancy and Steve up, that's fine with me. I also enjoy poly fic in this fandom.

Third Crusade RPF 
Richard I of England (Third Crusade), Philip II of France (Third Crusade)

Yes, yes, yes, I know, maybe it was just a political thing, Richard and Philip sleeping in the same bed. I don’t care. I want it not to be. I want all the stories where Richard and Philip fell as powerfully in lust and/or in love as Eleanor and Henry before them. Richard was widely known as being extremely attractive – 6’5”, powerful, reddish-gold hair, dynamic and decisive. I know less about Philip’s canonical looks, but I do love <a href=\"https://s25.postimg.org/whtq0xaun/amiel_portrait.jpg\">this 19th century portrait of him</a>, whether or not it’s accurate. 

Any of my general likes that fit this situation would be excellent here! (See my letter for general likes/prompts.) How does their relationship begin? When does Richard go from ‘enemy of my dad is my friend, let’s go talk to Phil and see if he’ll help’ to ‘shit, Phil grew UP’? Did Philip initially only intend to make his friendship with Richard tighter, and then once they’re in bed together for the grand Photo-Op of Friendship for the benefit of the court (and to disturb Richard’s father), realise that he’s got himself into bed with a tall drink of water? Do they joke about the complicated political situation in between stealing kisses in the garden? Is Richard the first guy Philip’s been with? Does either give the other symbolic jewelry/other presents? Does Richard joke about wanting to marry Philip instead of Philip’s half-sister Alys? 

Anything set during the period from 1187-1189, while Richard &amp; Philip were allied against Henry, would be amazing. I feel like this would be the happiest time for them, before Henry died and Richard became king, putting his relationship with Philip on an uneasier footing (given the power dynamics at play between France and England) and eventually leading to open conflict. All the happy falling-in-love, scheming-against-one’s-father, two ruthless young men falling in lust and love, as you can manage. :D

But this isn’t the only possible time period, of course! After Richard became King, he went on the Third Crusade with Philip and others, determined to rescue Jerusalem from Saladin. This could also be a very fruitful setting for fic. I think it’s really interesting that one of the reasons both Richard and Philip went on Crusade at the same time was that they were afraid that if one of them stayed behind he’d take advantage of the other’s absence to go after his land! It’s hard to be friends/lovers when you’re rival monarchs. :( If you’re writing shipfic during this time, I’d prefer a bittersweet tone that remembered good times of the past over a darker angst one, though there’s certainly angst to be had aplenty as Richard and Philip’s relationship unravels over the course of the Crusade. 

Feel free to use as much or as little of the politics of the Third Crusade as you like. I love history, and I love historical detail, so if you’re a gen writer and you want to write complicated-friendship fic about how Richard and Philip quarrelled over Cyprus, go for it. On the other hand, if you want to write a mostly-history-free story about Richard and Philip’s last night together before Philip leaves the Crusade and goes back to France, I’d love that too! 

I would also love a fic set in an AU where men marrying each other is totally normal (though rare among royalty because of the need for heirs), and Richard and Philip fall in love and decide to get married and combine their kingdoms (much to Henry and Eleanor’s probable dismay). It would work out heir-wise because Philip’s son Louis was born in 1187 and his wife Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, so he’d have been a widower free to marry for love at that point. (Or you could delete Philip’s marriage entirely, though in that case I’m not sure what they would have done for an heir. Mpreg? Adoption being a legitimate way to acquire royal heirs?) I would be equally pleased with this scenario being taken seriously or being treated more tongue-in-cheek (with comical reactions from Henry, Eleanor, John, etc.)

Wars of the Roses RPF 
Margaret Beaufort (Wars of the Roses), Margaret of Anjou (Wars of the Roses)

I really love these characters. Both of them had a huge number of trials in their lives, and they fought on anyway. (For more on my thoughts about them, see my letter - I have no room here.)

A general prompt for both of them: In the middle of all their political moves, they unexpectedly fall in love with one of their friends/ladies-in-waiting/enemies. They realise they’ve never actually been in love before (not surprising, given the political nature of their marriages), and this new development is both thrilling and scary. (I love snatched moments of happiness, even while the world is burning around you. I have no problem with infidelity if it's a f/f relationship that's ‘cheating’ on arranged/coerced marriages.)

For this fandom, feel free to treat it as \"or\" matching rather than \"and\". Although if you want to put both Margarets in the same fic, I'd be up for that too!


  <b>Margaret of Anjou</b>


Apart from Margaret-bashing stories and heartbreaking deathfic (aka when Edward dies at Tewkesbury), I’m open to pretty much anything. Some ideas:

•	When did Margaret first realise the scope of the task that loomed before her – protecting Edward’s inheritance until he was old enough to protect it himself? Did she quail at first? How did she learn to be ruthless?
•	Margaret and Edward’s relationship over the years, as she reared him to be the King his father had never been able to be. Did she worry that his father’s instability would be passed down to him? How did she feel when he started reaching maturity? When he married Anne Neville?
•	Margaret during Edward IV’s first reign, when she and her son Edward had fled to France and were making allies and building support. What were her first meetings with Warwick like?
•	It’s said that Elizabeth Woodville may have been one of Margaret of Anjou’s ladies at one point. If that was so, what might Margaret have thought of Elizabeth and where she ended up?
&nbsp;
  <b>Margaret Beaufort</b>

I want to read so many stories about Margaret! Seriously, if you have an idea already, I’m probably going to be all ears. (The only exception is that I’m not into a romantic Margaret/Edmund story, since she was twelve and had no choice in the matter.)

Some ideas:
•	Margaret’s negotiations with Elizabeth Woodville - what were those two powerhouses like together?
•	Margaret persuading/manipulating/forcing her husband Lord Stanley to betray Richard III, even though Stanley was risking the life of his own son in doing so
•	Margaret’s relationship with her son Henry over the years
•	Margaret was one of Anne Neville’s close friends and ladies-in-waiting – and yet was all the time planning to betray Anne’s husband Richard III (and thus Anne). Was this difficult at all for her?
•	Margaret’s relationship with Elizabeth of York
•	Margaret saying “done with men” and swearing an oath of chastity in front of everybody and moving out on her own while still married to Stanley. How amazing must it have been to live alone without a husband for the first time she could remember? How satisfying was it to be allowed to own her own property at last?
•	I’m all for women like Margaret being able to take joy in successfully completing their life’s work. What was Margaret feeling the day her son was crowned King of England?
•	How did Margaret change over the years, from the child mother to the Queen Mother Triumphant?

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
James I of Great Britain (Stuart Dynasty RPF), George Villiers 1st Duke of Buckingham (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Yes, this is the “<a href=\"https://deafeningtimetravelgalaxy.tumblr.com/post/165928527919/nudityandnerdery-bemusedlybespectacled\">Local King Cannot Stop Promoting His Boyfriend</a>” ship. :D

Basically for this fandom I’d love to read all the happy fun fic about a king and his handsome boyfriend (Buckingham was literally called “the handsomest-bodied man in all England” by a contemporary – not James I, though he presumably thought so too), who didn’t care what anybody thought about them, were totally in love, and even built a passage linking their bedrooms together. (The better to avoid any pesky dudes-in-waiting!)

For this a lot of my general prompts would work really well (see my letter for general prompts/likes), but a few specific ones:

•	Anything about the ‘constant promotions’ thing, whether serious (James is so in love, he can’t resist giving Buckingham more and more power and influence, damn the jealousy of other nobles!) or funny (‘you’re giving me another title, James? Why not just another blowjob?’)
•	AU in which marrying a guy is fine, it’s just the fact that Buckingham is the son of a minor gentleman and not a foreign prince that causes James headaches with the rest of the nobility. (But he doesn’t care, he’s still going to marry him.)
•	I’m also a big fan of historical marriages during periods where homosexuality was illegal. Just because it wasn’t public and ‘blessed by God’ doesn’t mean that James and Buckingham pledging themselves to each other wouldn’t have meant something to them. So anything in which they have a personal/private marriage would be great.
•	A fic about the way they met! (Apparently Buckingham ‘caught James’s eye’ at a hunt when he was twenty-one.) How did he catch James’s eye? Just by being drop-dead gorgeous? Was he funny/witty as well? Did he flirt with the king?
•	Given that Buckingham stayed in power after James died, because he was friends with James’s son Charles I, how did that relationship go during James’s lifetime? Did Charles know that James and Buckingham were lovers? (Did he care?) Obviously if he did know he didn’t freak out, since he didn’t denounce Buckingham or even have him removed from power once James died. (In fact Buckingham was the only man of James’s court to keep his position under Charles.)
•	Buckingham loved to sit for portraits. Fic of James being impatient at this and flirting with him/trying to persuade him to skive off his sitting early would be great. 
•	Anything with flirting in public in a homophobic society is my jam. Did they maintain plausible deniability? Were they pretty shameless, daring the nobles to do anything about it because James was King, soooo…
•	I absolutely love James’s declaration to the Privy Council: “You may be sure that I love the Earl of Buckingham more than anyone else, and more than you who are here assembled. I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had John, and I have George.” Anything about this/set on this day/what Buckingham said when he heard about it/etc. would be great!
•	Any of your own happy/funny plotbunnies about James/Buckingham!

I'd be thrilled with a story that touches on the lives of any of the nominated characters - Miriam, Ysabeau, Marcus, or Sarah - anything at all in the story's particular world of witches, daemons, and vampires, as well as the genetic lore in the Book of Life or the historical lore behind millennia of creatures. With the new TV series in production, interest is likely to rise. If you want to explore someone's personal history (centuries of options for many characters) or dive into what they were doing while Matthew and Diana timewalked to the Elizabethan era, I'd be thrilled.

I'm really open to anything for these characters, with the exception of love triangles. I don't mind if you write Nancy/Steve or Jonathan/Nancy or whatever, but I hate love triangles.

Not into it, not here for it. That being said, their friendship is one of my most favorite things, especially their shared pasts, and that would be fun to see explored. Full disclosure, Brandt is my favorite, so if you do any kind of MI story I'd really appreciate or request you'd make him the main focus. ;) I came away from Rogue Nation specifically in love with Ilsa Faust and her story, and have kind of totally partnered her up with Brandt in my head romantically, though I'd be into seeing how her dynamics work with Ethan or anyone else on the team. And Jane, well, I've loved Jane since GP and there's NEVER enough about her. I guess what I'm saying is ALL THE TEAM FIC OR BACKGROUND FIC OR EVEN JUST A FOCUS ON ONE CHARACTER WOULD BE GREAT?

I mean look if you wanna make this queer i am Obviously HERE FOR IT, and please feel free to push that rating as far up as you can make it go. But you def dont have to! They can screw the Farmer Boy on the tractor too (together? Independently? Sequentially?)! 

I kid, I kid. I just want free form free wheeling adventure feelings, riding down the highway playing hooky with your best friend, knowing you're the shit and you can bend this world to your will, because you are young and beautiful (and in love?) and you live in a world where strip clubs have amateur night (???) and you look amazing in a suit. Capture the feeling of the wind in your hair. Tell me about that car and where they got it. What happened when they got back to school? What happened to the tractor? Maybe its ten years later and life has twisted and turned but theyre still friends. Maybe theyre not, and they meet in a supermarket (at a strip club?) and suddenly the world seems fresher and they remember that night. Maybe someone's pregnant! Go crazy! Write me the novel of how their paths led to this moment. Write me porn. It always seems you got something on your mind other than me!
But maybe lets leave actual steven tyler out of it, yes?

Royal Tenenbaums (2001) 
Eli Cash

Hello what I actually want is Eli Cash, Ritchie Tennenbaum and Margo Tennenbaum. Together? Sequentially? Yes. (see above prompt) (Lord I am ridiculous this year. All I want is threesomes and music videos, I am sorry) (In life, as it is in Yuletide).

Please tell me exactly what everyone is wearing, and what is playing on their old timey record player. Is Eli Cash ok? I bet he is. He strikes me as more resilient than the actual Tenenbaums. Does anyone who IS a Tenenbaum want to be one? What do they do in that huge old house, how do they find peace? Or, what happened w this crew BEFORE the events of the movie, how did they struggle and fall towards and away from each other? Is Eli on drugs? Does Ritchie ever play tennis again? HMM. All this distance between them and these ways they intersect with each other and have for years...do they ever find a way back to each other? What do they do about their FATHER (Royal I mean). Maybe Richie's mental illness rears its head again and the other two have to take care of him. Maybe Eli and the other two have a huge fight. Maybe Margo takes up writing again. Yeah!

\"He's taken off his shoes, and one of his socks.\"

Request 1 by AngelQueen
Enola Holmes Series - Nancy Springer 
Enola Holmes, Sherlock Holmes (Enola Holmes)

I'd love to see how Enola might be involved in the events of The Final Problem. By the end of Enola's series, her brothers had come to accept her role as a detective in her own right, and one could assume that she and Sherlock might actually cooperate on a few cases. So when Sherlock's conflict with Moriarty rears its ugly head, how might Enola play into it? Would Moriarty threaten her, maybe send a few goons after her, to shake up Sherlock? Might Sherlock try to push her away to keep her at a safe distance so she doesn't get caught in the crossfire? I doubt Enola would care for that too much.

Would Sherlock confide in her about his survival at Reichenbach, or would he and Mycroft use her grief to sell Sherlock's demise to the wider world? One thing I'd love to see would be Enola racing across Europe to Reichenbach, intent on saving her brother, only to get up to the falls at the same time as Watson and the two of them having to deal with Sherlock's supposed demise?

Feel free to include other characters like Dr. Watson, Cecily Alistair, Mycroft Holmes, Mary Morstan, etc. if you need/want to.

Bonus points for Enola and Sherlock's eventual reunion and Enola giving him what-for for using her love for him in such a way.

DNWs: non-con, scat, d/s, A/B/O

Mary Russell - Laurie R. King 
Mary Russell, Sherlock Holmes (Mary Russell - King)

I'd love to see a fic delving into the off-hand comment at the end of The Marriage of Mary Russell where Russell ropes Billy into stealing a portrait of Holmes' mother out of the family chapel to give to Holmes. Perhaps a scene where they come back from their wedding trip and the portrait has already been delivered and hung in the cottage (perhaps in the sitting room)? Romantic goodness interspersed into this is always a plus (or as romantic as Russell and Holmes get, but then they would be newlyweds at this point - hint hint).

Feel free to include any other characters that you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

What if Richard had won at Bosworth? Would he have married Elizabeth? How do they handle all those who stood against them and participated in Henry Tudor's invasion? (I'd particularly love to see them deal with Margaret Beaufort.) 

Feel free to include as many other characters as you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Princess (TV) 
Margaret Pole Countess of Salisbury (White Princess (TV))

A missing scene from the finale or a continuance of the confrontation between Margaret and Elizabeth over the executions of Richard and Teddy. Elizabeth and Henry seemed to have planned to let the two men live quietly in the Tower so as to not further the curse set upon the killers of Elizabeth's brothers, but Margaret's revealing the truth to the Spanish ambassador put paid to that plan, backing Elizabeth and Henry into a corner and forcing them to execute the two men. I'd love to see something where that knowledge is shoved into Margaret's face, proclaiming that she is just as responsible for the deaths of Richard and Teddy as Elizabeth and Henry are. I would just love to see something really highlighting how far Margaret's relationship with Elizabeth has fallen.

Feel free to include any other characters you like/need.

Request 1 by angelsunknown
Anastasia - Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally 
Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov Grand Duchess of Russia (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally)

I LOVE THIS MUSICAL SO MUCH! Like, don't get me wrong -- I'd be psyched to receive fic re: any of my nominated characters/fandoms, but. But. I LOVE THIS MUSICAL. 

I also love everyone in this bar, but I love Anya the *most*, which is why I've requested fic for her specifically. Feel free to include the other characters in your fic, though! (Also: I've seen the bootleg of the Hartford Stage production, but I'm also going to be seeing the show at the Broadhurst in December (!!!), so you could totally use either version to fuel/prop up your fic!)

(Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ What are Anya and Dmitry up to, post-musical?
+ Give me an AU where Anya takes Gleb up on his offer re: the tea shop, or where she misses Dmitry and Vlad at the Y. Palace. How does this change things for her?
+ Okay, so. I have a secret, long-shot wish for this fandom that you are totally not required to (even attempt to) fulfill, especially if you aren't into the idea, but here goes: You know how Anya wakes up (after the Ipatiev House massacre) 'by the side of a road' with these 'tracks all around' her?* WHAT IF -- WHAT IF! -- ONE OF THE OTHER GRAND DUCHESSES HAD (ALSO SURVIVED THE SHOOTING AND) LEFT HER THERE (knowing that they'd each have a better chance of making it out of Yekaterinburg alive alone)? I mean, historically-speaking, Tatiana and Maria *did* make friends with/sympathisers of some of their guards, and Olga *was* pretty shrewd ... I don't know. I'm generally not a fan of totally upending canon, but the Romanovs' story is such a sad one, and -- this canon being a mixture of fantasy and history -- you could totally make it a *bit* happier. (And, like, 2017 has been A Year. We need all the happy endings we can get, you know?) I would love, love, love to read about Anya reuniting with her ~mysterious savior~, or Anya(, Dmitry,) and the ~mysterious savior~ living happily ever after (in anonymity) together. (Note: if you choose to go down this route -- which, holy shit, means you're the bomb dot com! -- I'd appreciate it if you kept the no. of Romanov survivors at two? I wouldn't want this to get *too* far-fetched or out of hand, lmao.)

DNW: Anya attempting to reclaim her royal status/throne; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); non-con/rape; romanticising of the (Bolshevik) guards/murderers OR of Nicholas and Alexandra's reign; unrelenting angst -- I love angsty fic, but would prefer to receive something with a happy ending.

Assorted Notes: I definitely ship Anya/Dmitry; I'm always here for (unrealistic) rom-com tropes (...clearly); I'd love for your fic to be grounded in (the musical's) canon, but am also not opposed to its being bolstered by historical fact; the member of OTMA I find most interesting outside of Anastasia is probably Maria (*insert winking face emoji here*); and I am deeply, deeply sorry for all of the word vomit.

*In the HS production, I believe the last we see of the (other) Romanovs is the scene where their palace is seized by the Bolsheviks, which would make it pretty easy for you to make up your own 'this-is-how-Anya-and/or-MS-escaped' theories. I've heard the Broadway production is a little different, but ... just roll with the canon? Hand-wave away inconvenient details?

Cairo Time (2009) 
Juliette Grant, Tareq Khalifa

I watched this at the gym today -- and I really enjoyed it! It felt like a love letter to Cairo in all its dingy, dirty glory. 

I really like the characters, too -- both Juliette and Tareq felt *real* and wonderful. I know Yuletide requests operate under an 'AND' assumption, but I'd be more than OK with you only writing about Juliette OR Tareq.

Here are some (Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ Epistolary fic! In which Juliette and Tareq write each other emails (or letters; Tareq feels like more of a letter writer to me!), post-movie.
+ Fic in which Juliette revisits Cairo.
+ Fic in which Juliette sees more of the Middle East.
+ One of my favourite scenes in the movie is the one in which Juliette walks around the mosque, so, I don't know -- fic about Juliette and religion/spirituality?
+ Fic in which Tareq and Yasmeen meet up for coffee and conversation, post-movie.
+ Fic in which Tareq meets Kathryn, post-movie.
+ Fic in which you tell me about Tareq's life, post-movie.

DNW: anything (sexually) explicit; character bashing; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); infidelity; wild AUs -- I love 'canon' AUs, but hate total re-hauls.


Request 3 by angelsunknown
The View RPF 

(Totally Optional) PROMPT:

Listen. You can totally do with this fandom/request what you will, but the reason I am requesting it -- and the reason I nominated it in the first place -- is that I think it would be ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS to write out a parody/satirised episode of the show in script-form, starring satirised versions of the hosts.

Like, I don't want to read about Actual Sunny Hostin, I want to read about Sunny the Super Prude. Give me Sara being totally bland and inoffensive on purpose, Jed. (RIP Jed.-era View!) only pretending to give a fuck re: conservative issues, Joy giving no fucks re: anything, Whoopi trying to make The View Whoopi's View every five minutes. (I didn't nominate Whoopi, because I ran out of slots, but feel free to include Whoopi --  and the Uber Christians (Paula and perpetually horny Candace) -- in this if you'd like!)

For what it's worth: my actual opinions/views on various matters tend to match Joy's and Sunny's; I disagree with Jed. (and Candace!!! She is The Actual Worst) on most things; and I am mostly 'meh' about Sara's and Whoopi's (and Paula's) contributions.

DNW: fic written in the first person; the hosts' RL children/husbands/partners/situations being brought into/up in the fic.

Richard II - Shakespeare 

I am always happy with Richard II fic of any kind. Absolutely anything about this play would ROCK, seriously. This is totally my standby \"if you don't like the other prompts I will always be happy with this\" prompt. There is actually a respectable (for a tiny little fandom) number of fics out there, but at this point, I actually wrote more than a few of them, and while they say \"write the fic you want to read,\" it's nice when sometimes you don't have to. So I will be thrilled with anything you write! It can be slash or het or gen, any rating (I love smutty fics, so don't be afraid to write them, but don't sweat it if you don't like to write them), and I am willing to ship Richard with pretty much anyone who isn't his uncle or Northumberland (although Aumerle is my fave). He's like that. I am also very AU friendly (I kinda have a dream of an AU that sets the play on a Napoleonic sailing ship, but can't get around to doing the research myself, but honestly any AU setting is one I will probably dig) and I love stuff with historical backstory so if that floats your boat, feel free to write it!

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
Ben Jonson (Stuart Dynasty RPF), John Donne (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Ben Jonson and John Donne are both poets (obviously!), both really difficult, and they were both Catholic for part of their lives. They also seem to have known each other, or at least had Strong Opinions about each other's poetry. Jonson comments on Donne's poetry a few times in his non-poetic works -- I know he does it in the Conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden and I think he also does it in Timber: or Discoveries (he makes fun of him for his irregular meters and says his Anniversaries are borderline blasphemous). Anyway! You can set it when they are young and generally confused, or when they are older and crankier, I do not care! And they can Have Adventures or alternately just drink beer and gripe, whatever you like. I would love to see a conversation between these two about poetry and religion and current events and possibly beer or whatever you'd like for them to talk about. There is no need to make it slashy, because I honestly cannot picture it (Donne I think is highly slashable if he's not, you know, Dean of St. Paul's at the time the fic is set, but Jonson is another matter), but if you can, I wouldn't, like, object to it or anything!

Rome (TV 2005) 
Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005)

I’d like anything about the requested characters, individually or together. For example, what were their lives like pre-series? They didn’t spring up fully formed at the battle of Alesia, right? What did the early years of the Vorenus/Niobe marriage look like? Where did Pullo spend his childhood? How did they join the legion?
What if Vorenus never found out about Niobe’s adultery, but Caesar still died. What Changes? What stays the same?
The lost adventures/camping trips we never got to see! Sightseeing! Intrigue! Rubbing elbows with the movers and shakers! Making love under the stars!
Post-series happy futurefic, farm optional. Because I ship them like burning, and Vorenus and Pullo alive and reunited is the only ending my id will accept.

Hornblower - C. S. Forester 
William Bush (Hornblower - Forester), Horatio Hornblower (Hornblower - Forester), Barbara Wellesley (Hornblower - Forester)

Bush POV please! He's my favorite character. I love his steadfastness, loyalty and stoicism. I love Hornblower's perfect balance between trainwreck and competence. I love how they work together well despite vastly different command styles - and that they wouldn't want it any other way. And then you throw Barbara into the mix...
Poor Horatio always seems to want what he doesn't have. When he's with Barbara, he's pining for \"better than a wife\" Bush, but as soon as he's at sea he starts missing the domestic life. Really, the solution is obvious: why not both? Long live the OT3!
I'd like something post-Flying Colours and pre-Lord Hornblower (or that goes AU from it). Sheerness is really not that far from the supposed Hornblower estate. And it only makes sense to invite Bush to celebrate his new captaincy (however desk-bound) in style! And Barbara, being the astute woman she is, would notice that while Horatio is cooling his heels waiting for his next command, and Bush is valiantly struggling not to hate his post, the one thing that cheers them up is each other's company... And then Horatio comes back from the Baltic terribly sick, owing his life to Bush, who has such a hard time relinquishing the nursing duties, and he and Barbara could bond over Horatio's sickbed...
And then they all work out an arrangement and raise Richard Arthur together and there's no Caudebec, right?

I'm constantly surprised that there's not more fic for this series. It's such a fun, delightful story with great characters! And boy, oh boy, would I love a fic about these three. Like, I love Jesper/Wylan, loooove them, but I also really love the unrequited feelings Jesper had for Kaz, and I adore the friendship between Jesper and Inej, and Kaz/Inej is like one of the few het ships I have cared about recently? So basically I'd be really interested to see a story about them! Whether it's full triangle poly or, um, a V, or even if it's just gen, tbh. They're the originals, yk! I'm so curious about their backstory. Or if you want to have smth set in the future (just writing out Wylan, maybe, bc I really do love him and Jesper, and it'd make me sad to think of them breaking up, lol). Anyway, just reiterating, I love the idea of romantic feelings between the three of them (whether requited or not), but I would also really, really love gen about their friendships. More details in my letter! \o/ &lt;3

Whenever I rewatch this movie, I find myself wishing more fic for these two existed. I would in particular love a fic about the two of them falling in love after they move to New York City together. I know they would face difficulties and challenges because of the time period, but I would prefer that not to be the main focus of the fic. Please, no tragic endings or violence. I can handle angst/hurdles, but I'd prefer a happy or hopeful ending. I am generally just in love with them as characters and would be equally thrilled for great friendship fic as they spend their twenties trying to find the path that works for them (i.e., some level of deviation from the path prescribed for women of their generation).

Jupiter Ascending (2015) 
Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending), Caine Wise

This film hit so many notes on the scale of my id I cannot even. I rewatched it for letter-writing purposes and oh. my. god. I came out with a Lot of Jupiter/Caine feelings and also a Lot of feelings about Space Bureaucracy and also about praise!kink wolf fucking. I have no idea how to punctuate that latter, sorry dear writer. I'm also totally and enthusiastically on board with knotting for this pairing, but please no reference to wanting to breed someone or filling them with cum.

I would love a fic with lots of ridiculous space bureaucracy details, any exploration into tiny glimpses of the world we got in the film (what do the Skyjackers do? does Jupiter continue to have a relationship with the Aegis? does Caine get a pack again?), and I would be happy with space bureaucracy gen or something super shippy or something full of space princess/space wolf-splice sexytimes, Also while I don't want Balem resurrected, I'd be so happy for Titus and Kalique to make an appearance and I don't mind them being shipped with Jupiter (Kalique/Jupiter is my other fave just sayin'; and I'm also happy for Kalique/Titus to be the other ship if they do make an appearance) - but I don't want Jupiter/Caine to be broken up for it, or for it to happen without consent within the Jupiter/Caine ship.

Sated - Rebekah Weatherspoon 
Keira Kenney (Sated), Daniel Song (Sated)

I would love to see fic which explores more of their lives together either during or after the book. While the book itself is pretty explicit, I'd be very happy with non-explicit shippy fic exploring Keira's interest in Galaxis fandom or kickboxing, or Daniel's interest in pyrotechnics, but I would also love super porny fic too. One of the things that I found frustrating with Sated was that the initial dynamic I really liked at the beginning, where Keira topped and Daniel subbed, very quickly seemed to change by the end into Keira subbing all the time. So I would love to see more of Keira topping and getting to explore her fantasies with Daniel.

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi | Spirited Away 
Ogino Chihiro, Haku | Nigihayami Kohakunushi

This is basically one of my forever requests. I've been lucky enough to have some really amazing gifts for it already, but as this is the Ghibli film of my HEART, I am always hungry for more. This film has basically all of the things I love: protagonist leaving her everyday world for a stranger magical one, magic (a bathhouse of the gods!) alongside everyday mundaneity (CLEANING the bathhouse of the gods!) in that world, DRAGONS, coming of age themes, all the tiny magical elements of a Miyazaki film...

I would love to see future fic for this film about Chihiro as a teenager, a university student, an adult, any stage of her life really! Does she ever get to go back? What about Haku? I ship them like burning and would love to see their reunion (and perhaps courtship and eventual wedding and divine domestic bliss) but I would also be tremendously gloriously happy with genfic about Chihiro's life post-film. What does she do? What is her life like? How does the Land of Spirits bleed over into her life?

The Watchmaker of Filigree Street - Natasha Pulley 
Grace Carrow

I would really, really love future fic for Grace exploring her life after the book. Reference to Thaniel and Mori is fine, but I would prefer them not to form a significant part of the story as I feel the book already made a sufficient case for both of them. I would like Grace to get to achieve her dreams of Continuing to Study Science &amp; Conduct Strange Eldritch Experiments, but beyond that I am open to speculation: does she become Matsumoto's mistress? Does she just go as his friend and he acts as her wealthy patron? Does she make some other women friends once she's out of her usual milieu? Does she take up with an eccentric and wealthy OFC? Does she stay in Japan or does she keep travelling? Does she do her best to forget Mori or does she try to investigate the phenomenon of his abilities more closely? Does she ever see him and Thaniel again?

Shetland (TV) 
Jimmy Perez, Cassie Perez, Duncan Hunter

The relationship between Jimmy and Duncan (and by extension Cassie) is my favorite on the show. One of the things I love is that Duncan and Jimmy know each other well enough to know what hurts the other-- there's that exchange, I forget in what episode, where they fight and Jimmy acknowledges that he's a surly bastard. They don't seem to have the kind of relationship with anyone else in the show, and I love how fraught and complicated their interactions are. And I love how Cassie has different relationships with each of them, and gets different things from them, and works to establish her independence from them in different ways. Honestly, I ship the hell out of Jimmy/Duncan, but if you want to write gen that's fine too.

Whether you want to focus on the romantic and sexual aspects or the friendship is up to you -- either way, I'm here for the ride. Make it tumultuous, make it less than perfect, and I will be thoroughly satisfied. Please stick to the TV show canon; I have read the comics, but prefer this adaptation.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye, Tahani Al-Jamil

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love the universe of the Good Place and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, and I ship Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani, so if that's up your alley, feel free to write about any or all of those ships. I don't have any preference among the three, and will be super pleased with anything you produce. I'm totally fine with smut, but I don't like dubcon (and I don't think it makes a ton of sense with these characters anyway?) I also really love Jason/Janet if that's something  you're interested in including. In terms of characters I really like, I love the entirety of Team Cockroach, Vicki, and Trevor.

In terms of specific prompts or ideas, I'd love to see any of the reboots from \"Dance Dance Resolution\" that are only hinted at - any of the times the gang went to Mindy St. Clair's, the Eleanor/Tahani soulmate attempt, and the one where the whole group is spying on the clown conveyor belt for whatever reason are all some of my favorite canon reboots. I'm also super open to any reboot scenario you want to go with. I especially like the idea of using reboots to do kind of trope-heavy AU stuff - there's a fic in the tag that's a university AU that I really like. 

If Eleanor hasn't shown Chidi the tape yet by the time you're writing this or there's a different way you'd like to imagine that interaction playing out, that would be super cool. I also like the idea of a version where Eleanor says I love you to Tahani. 

Cool, mindblowing stuff is definitely going to happen on the show after I write this, so if that inspires you to do something else, definitely do it. I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) 
Rebecca Bunch, Heather Davis, Valencia Perez, Greg Serrano

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love CEG and its characters and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, but with the caveat that I think shipping fics are a bit different for CEG given that the majority of the characters are not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. I like Rebecca/Greg, Rebecca/Valencia, and Rebecca/Heather most in fics when they explicitly acknowledge that the relationship is unhealthy (R/G especially) or, even better, both people are in a better place mentally and emotionally or are getting there together. I also love Heather/Valencia and Darryl/White Josh, and am totally fine with traditional, fluffy romance for them, because they deserve it and are way more ready for that than Rebecca. I'm totally okay with smut for any of the pairings listed, but I don't want dubcon. 

Although I couldn't list them, I love Paula, Darryl, White Josh, Hector, and Father Brah and would love to any of them included if it makes sense for your story. 

In terms of non-romantic stuff, I'm obsessed with the girl gang and would love to just see a story about them scheming against Josh, or really just hanging out. I would love to see a parody/takeoff of Gone Girl with Rebecca. I'd also be interested in seeing Rebecca and Greg just interact at this point without being romantic at all - maybe Greg hears about the wedding debacle and calls her/flies back to West Covina for some reason and sees her? I'm really curious as to whether Greg actually managed to break his patterns and succeed at Emory, and I miss Greg/Rebecca interactions, so if you want to take it in that direction, I'd be down.

Since the season hasn't started yet, it's really hard to predict what cool stuff might come up, so if there's anything that happens in s3 that you really want to write about, go for it! I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Groundhog Day - Minchin/Rubin 
Phil Connors (Groundhog Day Musical), Rita Hanson (Groundhog Day Musical)

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love this show  and will be into whatever you produce.

I ship Phil/Rita, and I like romantic fics, so if you're into that kind of thing, definitely go for it! I really  like AUs - some AU ideas I'm into are ones where the loop ends at a different time, Rita and Phil are both in the loop, completely different AUs like the college AU in the tag. I also like the idea of deleted scenes from within the loop - how did Phil interact with Rita during the time between If I Had My Time Again and Seeing You, when he was trying to help out the town? Did he ever tell Rita about the loop after the one day we see? Future fics are also great, especially ones where Phil has to figure out how to tell Rita about the loop or is kind of angsty about how much he already loves her when she really doesn't know him. 

If you're not into Phil/Rita or romance, I really love any stories you might have about life for Phil during or after the loop. I like fun stories during the Philandering time period where Phil gets up to some crazy stuff, stories about Phil going back to Punx at some point and what that would be like, or just whatever you can think of. In terms of Rita-centric fic, I'd love to see a fic from her pov at any point in the loop, especially the day Phil tells her about the loop, or literally anything about her background/family. I like the idea that Rita and Phil become best friends even if they're not romantic.

These are all just some ideas if you're looking for inspiration - I will love whatever you write! Thanks for indulging me, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Killjoys (TV) 

General likes: gen, friendships, found families, team as family, plot, character studies, humor, angst, banter, competence, magic, mythology, crossovers (as long as I’m familiar with the other fandom). I’m okay with relationships, but I’d prefer if they weren’t the main focus of the story.

General dislikes: explicit sex, rape/non con, A/B/O, mundane AU’s (i.e. coffee shop, high school), major character death (unless it’s canon, but even then I’m often in denial). Also, I’d rather not get a Christmas-themed fic.

There are so many things I love about this show, including the world building, the themes of found family and identity and recovery, and Turin’s hair. Team Awesome Force is a delight, as are all of the secondary characters (Fancy’s arc in season 3 was incredible).

One thing: I do feel strongly that David’s mental illness was not caused solely by his powers or by the presence of the Shadow King in his mind, so if you’re going to write a post-season 1 fic featuring him, I’d appreciate it if his schizophrenia wasn’t magically cured.

The Prestige (2006) 
Alfred Borden, Robert Angier

DNWs: Incest, Suicide, Rape/Noncon

Things I love about this canon: obsession, corruption, the mechanics of a magic trick, schemes of revenge, the flirtation with science and magic (via Tesla), and Twin Christian Bales (who have distinct personalities that shine through to the point where you can guess which is which when they’re on screen!) 

Ships: Canon ships only, please!

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

Two very different people with wildly varying moral truths investigating paranormal activities! Ruminations over journalism ethics and also the apocalypse! Sign me up!

I've always adored supernatural stories/investigation and Monster-of-the-Week type stories. Especially when they involve a straight-laced skeptic possibly finding out that he's got psychic powers and a lady journalist who dealing with how far she can (or will) go to find the truth at the bottom of whatever conspiracy.  I also cannot stress enough how much I'm a sucker for straight-laced, buttoned-up characters and pushing them to their breaking point. I don't think we've fully gotten to that point with Richard Strand...but how would we get there?

Daybreakers (2009) 
Edward Dalton

Ohh, this movie. The cold city noir/sun-soaked country aesthetic is like catnip to me.

I love ridiculously moody science fiction thinkpieces and this is...nearly there. Vampirism is a metaphor for our dependence on fossil fuels! Sam Neill is the literal bloodsucking embodiment of corporate greed! Ethan Hawke is conflicted and just wants to change the system, but HE IS THE SYSTEM! Fedoras are back in style! 

For what could have been just a gushy/gory vampire film, there's actually a lot of thoughtful worldbuilding that I would just love to see explored. A lot of little tidbits that were barely hinted at: the outbreak starting with a bat bite, what's happening globally/in third-world countries, the fact that forest fires are a major problem because starving vampires are going out hunting and then accidentally getting barbecued when they don't get out of the sun in time....

Iron Fist (TV) 
Ward Meachum (Iron Fist (TV)), Jeri Hogarth (Iron Fist (TV))

I'd really love to see Ward and Jeri interact more (no romantic relationships though, please). She's officially Rand's legal counsel now, right? And with the bonds of attorney/client privilege and what she already knows, she's probably one of the few people Ward would be able to talk to about the events of the series and (possibly) what happens after. So, please. Give me Ward trying to talk to literally the only person he can (since Joy's possibly hard to reach and Danny's off in K'un-Lun) while Jeri is Not Having It and trying to keep her head above water with this whole \"superhero\" thing.

Victoria (TV) 
Queen Victoria (1819 - 1901) (Victoria (TV)), Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Victoria (TV))

Victoria and Albert are fascinating to me as individuals and I also really love them together. Their marriage is so interesting and unique-- the power dynamics and how they fit together. I love how they became so Ride or Die for each other and at the same time they're still feeling out how they work together. It's very enemies-to-lovers-to-friends, how they initially clash but are honestly like 100% hot for each other. I adore that trope. Season 1 had really a lot of interesting UST. I'd love to see small problems with Victoria's marriage that she and Albert have to work through, or them just getting used to each other. I also really admire how they work together as a unit.

The Wolf Among Us 
Bigby Wolf (The Wolf Among Us)

This world is so interesting to me because you have the dichotomy of the \"Happily Ever After\" vs. what happens afterward, as well as some of these stories that were pretty dark to begin with. I really love the struggling underbelly of Fabletown and how people still fear Bigby Wolf because of what he's done in the past, but aren't quite to respecting him yet.  Bigby Wolf is very intriguing, especially at this stage in his relationship with Fabletown. (I do love my socially-awkward characters.)  

You can use whatever characters you like from the comics and the game, although I’m only specifically requesting Bigby. Have a favorite fable or urban legend that isn't in the game or comics but you'd like to use? DO IT! I'm very interested in hearing about your take on different fables/characters, it's one of the things that drew me to this game/comic series in the first place. (I also definitely ship Bigby/Snow, but I'd also be interested in Nerissa/Bigby, and I really loved his in-game interactions with Gren, Holly, and Woody as well.) If you do want additional fairytale inspiration, I loved The Wild Swans and One Eye, Two Eyes, Three Eyes as a kid.

Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) 
Emhyr var Emreis (Witcher Games)

Likes/Dislikes:

- Emhyr conquering everything and being all imperial and commanding, also competent

- I like scheming/cunning/in control Emhyr, also power dynamics

- bonus points if you somehow include Geralt (as a lover and/or ally), who has difficulty dealing with/getting used to all the protocol/servants/pomp/extravagance.

- no retired and/or preparing/planning to abdicate Emhyr please

- I generally like Emhyr being older and well established in his position as emperor, but if you want to do something set earlier, like Emhyr vs the Usurper or the subsequent power struggle for the throne (that led to Emhyr paving his ballroom with the gravestones of his political enemies), then that's fine as well.

- gen, het or slash welcome. Emhyr/Geralt is awesome, but Emhyr/his 3+ concubines is great as well. Or both. Heck if you want to you can even do Emhyr/Pavetta (just no endless pining once he's no longer Duny, please) or Emhyr/false Ciri.

- Regarding Ciri:
While I do quite like (both) Ciri(s), I'd prefer for her to only have a minor role in the story (if she is included at all), unless you want to go all the way and add both real and false Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, that could be fun. Especially if Emhyr marries false Cirilla and then later finds real Cirilla ...
Or even better, you could go super deep and dark and do Emhyr, Ciri &amp; the Slaughter of Cintra. Remember nobody, including the queen, knew that Emhyr had once been a prince of Cintra or that Queen Calanthe (who committed suicide with the rest of the city during the Slaughter of Cintra) was his mother-in-law ... AND it was assumed that he wanted to kidnap Ciri in order to marry her, not to get his daughter back.
So yeah, what were his thoughts, actions, motivations for letting things play out the way they did? What if he had done things differently? (like tell Calanthe that he was once Duny or that he had to invade in order to secure his position on the throne) What would the consequences have been?
See why I would prefer no Ciri? It makes me think too much and fall down a hole of what ifs ... :D

- no total AUs, some modifications are fine (like books vs games) but no Modern AUs etc please

Damien (TV) 
Damien Thorn

Likes/Dislikes:
- no fluffy romance please, the darker/creepier the better
- gen, het or slash all welcome
- no AUs please
- no Supernatural crossovers please, other crossovers are fine but not necessary

Prompts:

- Damien's childhood in the White House (as the show uses actual footage from the original movie, I consider all of it canon, including the very end where POTUS gets custody of Damien after his parent's deaths)

- How does young Damien's super privileged environment of politicians and trust fund kids react to him running off to become a war photographer of all things?

- Damien's life as a war photographer pre-series and how his presence in war zones unknowingly makes everything worse

- What happens in the aftermath of the Season 1 finale? Can be from anyone's POV, the darker the better (that's true for all prompts)


Request 3 by araline
The Young Pope (TV) 
Andrew Dussolier, Lenny Belardo

Story does not have to include all requested characters, just one is totally fine!

Likes/Dislikes:
- Andrew is very welcome to do all of Honduras/Rome/mankind separately or simultaneously in any and all combinations and positions, but please, PLEASE keep Lenny asexual and aromantic.
- also no total AUs, Andrew (if included) has to be a cardinal and Lenny (if included) has to be the pope
- crossovers are welcome as long as it isn't with Supernatural

Prompts:

- Andrew and/or Lenny's secret incognito adventures: this can take place either during THAT night in Episode 5, or some other time, like Andrew going out and about in Honduras (orgies optional). Anything goes as long as the people he/they are interacting with don't know about them being a cardinal/the pope for at least part of the story

- Lenny actually is a saint and can perform true miracles: how does the world react? how does the church make use of this?

- Lenny is the Antichrist: will anyone figure it out in time or does the world believe he's a saint till the end?

- Andrew isn't killed: what happens instead/what consequences does this have?

Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Goosefat Bill (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Kung Fu George (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I'd be really happy with anything you decided to write for this fandom! Maybe a fic that plays with Arthurian legend with a Guy Ritchie twist, or some extra info on Arthur's life growing up, or how he grows into being a king after the end of the film. You don't have to use all the characters I nominated, or you can definitely use more if you want! Gen is lovely, or if you want to go the ship route I ship both Arthur/Mage and Arthur/Goosefat Bill and would be happy to receive either.

Hustle Cat 

Give me all the characters of Hustle Cat! I love them all. I'd love to see any of them in their day to lives (yes, including Nacht), especially how the \"cursed cats\" cope after falling under the curse. An AU where Avery does fall under the curse temporarily and studies the book whenever they can - and in the meantime being part of the \"Jelly Donut and Albatross\" (or whatever name you choose for cat!Avery) show. Graves teaching Avery to talk to cats or other magic. Mason just being with her grandpa. Hayes goes on a date to his favorite non-work restaurant with a date after the end.

I'm a bit squicked out by Avery/Graves, so I'd prefer friendship fic between the two. Pairing Avery (any gender) with any of their coworkers is fine.

An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Miles (An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship)

I love all the cliches in this story and how Alicia deals with them, but I love Miles even more. Alicia might be the focus of the story, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her at all, but it's Miles that is the most interesting. I have a soft spot for accountants and it's great that he uses an accountant's skills to get them through the castle, and also how he tries to save the kingdom as best he can. So, write me Miles wanting to just get back to the kingdom, desperately trying to save it, just Miles being Miles and doing the best he can!

Belsomra \"Cats and Dogs\" Commercial 

I have a soft spot for both cats and dogs, and love this commercial! What I would like to see is the relationship between the sleep cats, the wake dogs, and the owners - do you have to feed the things? What do you feed them with?  Does everybody get their own personal sleep cats and wake dogs? How would the world be different if you have these two animals all your life - can they be taken away from you, and what would happen to you?

Jonathan Sims, Martin Blackwood, Elias Bouchard

Note: Using just Jon+Martin or just Jon+Elias rather than all three is fine for this one!
DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I like pretty much anything with Jon/Martin or Jon/Elias, whether that's just one of them or both existing at the same time (though no Jon/Martin/Elias or Martin/Elias, in that case)! Non-shippy is good too.

With Jon and Martin, I'd particularly enjoy things set around when Martin was living in the archives, after Prentiss' attack, or some kind of fix-it after the end of season two. Moments where Jon is slightly less prickly and horrible to Martin are A+.

With Jon and Elias, messed-up things post-s2 or things pre-s2-finale where Elias is shady as hell and Jon doesn't realize are both great.

Alternatively, I'm also weirdly attached to coffeeshop AU where Jonathan Sims is the manager who should definitely never be allowed to interact with customers but has to anyway, if you feel like something more mundane, and I'm down for things involving the other assistants too in that case!

Other general things I like: D/s (exclusively with sub Jon), trans guy Jon (written so that it's pretty much only relevant if you're writing porn), hurt/comfort.

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I enjoyed Peter and James' relationship, so that's the main thing I'd be looking for re Peter Darling fic - particularly either more interaction set in the middle of the book, or exploring things after the end between them and how things work out back in the real world.

I'd also be interested in an AU where Neverland was more complete and they didn't end up leaving, particularly something where the relationship stayed more on the Pan/Hook side of things than the Peter/James side!

Night World - L. J. Smith 
Ash Redfern

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

Ash is my favorite character by a long way - everything about his aesthetic and the fact that he's trying to better himself and just. Pretty much anything, honestly?

I ship him with Poppy and Mary-Lynnette, so if you're looking to write shipfic then one of those is what I'd be looking for! Gen is also good - him interacting with Circle Daybreak, what he's doing to try to better himself and make up for his past, etc etc

I like canon divergent AUs for Night World - the main ones that are coming to mind are either 'AU where Ash is Poppy's soulmate, not James' (though please either handwave or tie up Poppy/James in that case, because infidelity is a big DNW and I'm not into it as an OT3!) or 'AU where Mary-Lynnette didn't stay human after Daughters of Darkness'.

Cormoran Strike Series - Robert Galbraith 
Cormoran Strike, Robin Ellacott

More details in my letter!

Casefic - Strike and Robin are hired to investigate something, but it turns out to be more than it first appears.

Any of my fave fanfic tropes - undercover as married, stakeouts, forced bed sharing, etc. I feel this is a couple ripe for the classic tropes!

Also, Trapped Together - what happens if they are stuck somewhere and can’t escape?

Road trip hunting a serial killer the police don’t believe exists.

Robin’s first solo case as partner turns into a bit of a mess.

A historical AU of some kind would be fun! WW1 era, noir from the 40s, Victorian…any, really!)

A slightly more specific casefic prompt with an added side of kink: A hotel manager hires Strike to investigate which of his employees is placing cameras in the guests’ rooms. Only thing is, he wants them to be discrete so the culprit doesn’t know they are onto him, so Strike ropes Robin in to play his wife and they check into the hotel. Problem is, to be convincing they have to play a couple even in private, because of the cameras watching their every move…

    Post-Career of Evil Prompts (Spoilers!)

    Robin doesn’t marry Matthew. I don’t mind how you do it - whether you let her find out about him deleting her messages before the ceremony and she calls it off; if she punches Matthew in the face at the altar; if she says “actually, I don’t” and just walks away from the asshole…any of the above! I just don’t want her legally bound to that douche. Strike can definitely help with this if you like.

A lot of people from Strike’s past show up in CoE. Do any others try to exact revenge?

Matthew is killed. The police think Robin did it. And Strike’s not so sure she didn’t…

The Awakening (2011) 
Florence Cathcart, Robert Mallory

More details in my letter!

Florence is canon into voyeurism (both in that she liked watching Robert, and liked the idea of him watching her) - so what is the sex life with Robert like going forward? Does she like to watch and be watched? (Either way, I see her as liking to be in control of it, not so much the idea of strangers watching her, or it being done without her consent)

Post-movie, Florence and Robert are separated for a time - do they write each other letters?

Florence now believes in ghosts. Where does that leave her career? Does she still hunt down the fakes, as well as the real things? Does Robert come with her? Or do people come to her with their supernatural troubles?

Robert is nervous about proposing, but Florence is getting impatient.

On their honeymoon, they go to some of the oldest places in Europe. Surely there are ghosts lurking in every corner. What kind of trouble do they get into?

Florence Cathcart: Demon Hunter (Have fun with it! If ghosts exist, why not demons?)

A missing scene from the film with additional/bonus pining?

I do really want a happy ending here for Florence and Robert, but if you want to do something interesting with the hints that she might be a ghost herself at the end of the film, I’ll be interested if you can make it work.

The canon ended just as they got to the interesting bit of the relationship. What happens next? How do they navigate this new relationship as they were just getting used to the old one?

Their brush with crime has given them a taste of a more interesting life. What happens when someone else gets murdered? Do they investigate themselves?

Alfred doesn’t want to spend his newly acquired money on anyone but Louisa and Alfie. How does she feel about this?

What would their first time be like? Are they traditional (waiting until after marriage) or do they decide to be more unconventional? (I imagine that Louisa would be a bit happier to have sex before marriage - not wanting to shackle herself to another man so soon. But Alfred seems like he’d be a little more traditional. Who would win that battle?)

Miss Marple comes back for a visit and attracts some trouble. How do they deal with it?

Does Miss Marple ask for help with a case?

Lots of people died at Greenshaw’s Folly. What if the place is now haunted?

Dislikes/DNWs: Miserable endings. Major character death. Baby/Pregnancy/kidfic. Drugs use/drug mentions/addiction. Self harm/abuse. Non-con/rape. Heavy kink. A/B/O. M-Preg. Incest. Bestiality, animal harm etc. Nothing underage. Unbalanced power dynamics. 1st person POV (unless for epistolary). Not big on high school AUs or Rock band AUs.

Boston Legal 
Denny Crane (Boston Legal), Alan Shore (Boston Legal)

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! I love the way Alan and Denny love each other. They can and do disagree and about a lot of things, but they really do complete each other, and they both know it. I would love to see almost anything with them, set any time. (Please nothing that focuses on Denny's advancing illness per se.) A slice of life, Coast Guard adventures, curtainfic, kittenfic, road trip, new client, gone fishin', -- anything will make me happy. I miss these two a lot. &lt;3

Peacemakers (2003) 
Larimer Finch, Jared Stone

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! Finch and Stone are rock-solid favorites of mine, and I miss them a lot. Anything you want to write, from a case story to them sitting on the porch one day watching the townsfolk go by, from courtroom session to a slice of life, from wacky hijinks to intimate vulnerability -- it's all good. I just love the connection between these two, and as long as that's there, I'll be happy.

The Slipper and the Rose (1976) 
Prince Edward (The Slipper and the Rose (1976)), John (The Slipper and the Rose (1976))

Slash or gen, any rating, please! Edward and John are a charming mystery in the middle of a charming movie. They're clearly very close and comfortable with each other (despite the usual constraints of position and positioning), but at the same time don't actually seem to know that much about each other, like they've only recently met. I would love to see more about them together that goes into that closeness and newness - anything from quiet mutual snark at a function to a walk in the garden to teaming up in an incognito brawl at a tavern to their first meeting to anything at all. Just more of these two, please. &lt;3

Letter: http://arduinna.dreamwidth.org/105770.html

Tango & Cash (1989) 
Gabriel Cash, Raymond Tango

Slash or gen, any rating, please! I love these two, how they’re both so incredibly competent and confident, and how they’re that much better together no matter how much they would rather not admit it. I would love to see more of them together, however that happens - a case, a night on the town, competing at the firing range, a \"grill the best burger\" challenge - anything. Snark and banter and growing respect &amp; trust are a fantastic combination.

Valdemar Series - Mercedes Lackey 
Kethry (Valdemar), Tarma shena Tale'sedrin

Gen, any rating, please! Tarma and Kethry are my all-time favorite Lackey characters: smart, practical/pragmatic, competent and determined to keep training/learning to maintain and improve on that competence, utterly loyal to each other, wry, self-aware – I just love them. And I love their relationship, built on bedrock but one they know they need to pay attention to (like the way Tarma has to make sure she doesn't wrap fully capable Kethry in cotton wool, just because she's promised to be the mother of Tarma's renewed tribe). I'd love anything about them: the early days of their lives as she'enedran and each of them adapting to suddenly knowing they'll never be alone again; off on a job (either a regular for-hire job, or something Need drives them to); learning to be part of a bigger mercenary force; their lives as teachers and running a school; time among the Clans; hanging out at an inn or resupplying at a marketplace; dealing with a storm out in the open – whatever may strike your fancy, I'm all for it.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

(I'm going to be away from a computer until around October 12, but after that I should have a Dear Yuletide Author letter up for you over on aria at dreamwidth! Meanwhile, a couple of details here:)

I'd love something post-series that addresses how exactly Damen and Laurent start the political process of uniting their kingdoms -- how do they reconcile their cultures? What are they going to do about an heir/the long-term viability of ruling together? How do their various ways of being politically competent compliment each other? Otoh if you don't want to do plotty politicking, any nice post-series slice-of-life with the two of them (porny or not!) would also/or instead be a delight.


Request 2 by Aria
Wayfarers Series - Becky Chambers 
Rosemary Harper, Sissix Seshkethet, Dr. Chef (Wayfarers Series), Ohan (Wayfarers Series)

Again, something post-series would be great! I'd love a story about the crew dealing with Ohan as a single entity, and how the dynamics among them change; if you want to do something plotty, I'd be fascinated to see how Ohan feels post-virus, and whether he is content to just stay on the ship or wants to connect with the others of his species who are also single entities now. I'm also up for anything about Dr. Chef (I love Dr. Chef so much!) or indeed anything about the crew as a family. I'd also be really into a story about Rosemary and Sissix's relationship -- visiting Sissix's relatives, or having Sissix hang out with some humans, or just a day in the life with the two of them, whatever! Honestly anything about the Wayfarer crew as found family would be wonderful.


Request 3 by Aria
Provenance - Ann Leckie 
Tic Uisine, Garal Ket | Pahlad Budrakim, Ingray Aughskold, Taucris Ithesta

I would love anything about any of these ridiculous people! How does the Tic/Garal and Ingray/Taucris double date go? What adventures do Tic and Garal get up to together? What's Ingray's life like after the events of the book? Do any of them end up going to the Conclave? These are all just suggestions off the top of my head, really anything about any of them would be lovely.


Request 4 by Aria
Crimson Peak (2015) 
Thomas Sharpe, Lucille Sharpe, Edith Cushing

Sorry, this is one of my more specific requests! What I'd really love from a Crimson Peak story is a weird gothic Thomas/Lucille/Edith threesome, though I have no preference for whether this is an AU where no one is trying to kill anyone or an extra layer to the existing story. If a weird gothic threesome really isn't your jam, though, that's okay! I'd also take a story about Thomas and Lucille before Edith turned up, or a story about Edith writing her sensational novel after the events of the movie, etc.


Request 5 by Aria
The Road to El Dorado (2000) 
Tulio (Road to El Dorado), Miguel (Road to El Dorado), Chel (Road to El Dorado)

I would love really any story about these three! An OT3 would be particularly delightful, as would a ridiculous heist, but I'd also take a story about any of them pre-movie, or really whatever strikes your fancy.

Sengoku Basara 

Preferred focus on Mitsunari and Ieyasu as a ship, please! I like them in any ways and all ways. Fluffy stories in their younger days is good. Tragic/angsty, even character death is totally acceptable too. Sexy times is good, Ieyasu topping Mitsunari is good. Ieyasu being sweet and gentle and Mitsunari being an angry tsundere kitty is good. Squicks are: no sexy times with them as small children, no rape. Thank you dear writier!

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

Okay, I chose Arthur and the Mage, and honestly, I just enjoy their relationship. I enjoy the way she challenges him but also supports him, and how he respects her abilities and doesn't treat her like the chick in the group. So, you could do pretty much anything with these two and it'd be fine.

BUT. Let me give you another option that I would be OVER THE FUCKING MOON about. Tell me ANYTHING about Arthur's relationship with the women who raised him. It can be a past-fic during his childhood, it can be a fic predicated upon the idea that some of them survived and he gives them jobs in the kingdom, it can be ANYTHING about them and I will do a Dance of Happy. Many times over.

Ready Player One - Ernest Cline 
Art3mis | Samantha Cook, Aech | Helen Harris, Shoto | Akihide Karatsu

I feel like apologizing if you matched with me on this, because nine times out of ten, when I want fanfic, it's because I really liked the universe, and I just want more. That tenth time is when the universe drove me crazy, and I want someone to fix it a little. Guess which one this is?

So, as you probably noticed, I listed Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto as my characters of choice. Give me ANYTHING with these characters in a future fic and I will be pleased as punch. Maybe Art3mis works on helping women get into coding and researhing alternate fuel sources? Maybe Aech finds a way to engage young AA persons in their OWN 70s-80s-90s culture (or just discovers how much of it there IS, now that she's done living her life for a white dude's quest) or something like that for queer teens? Maybe Shoto finds ways to honor Daito's life, to help other Japanese teenagers who are in similar situations? Whatever, just. Tell me about these characters living their lives now that they have safety and cash and their own maneuverability.

Batwoman (Comic) 

In my dreams of dreams of dreams, I would really like a story about Kate's Judaism. And, like, something that's not Hanukah. What does she dress up as on Purim? What's her favorite filling for hamentashen? Does she eat nothing but ice cream on Shavuot and consistently tell the others it's a religious requirement? Does she make the family have a picnic every Lag B'Omer? What's a Shabbat dinner at Kate's like? Does she plan apple picking field trips before Rosh Hashanah? What are the things she atones for during Yom Kippur? Does she kidnap and make Damian help decorate the sukkah at her shul? Anything that's just a snippet of her being Jewish and I would cry from happy until I flooded my home state.

But, if that's super not your thing, you can also just tell me a story about Kate being The Gay and I will also be super happy. Like, tell me all about how getting kicked out over DADT felt, or how she felt when it was repealed, or where she was when the Sup Ct decision making gay marriage legal was, or...whatever, honestly.

I love the combination of humor and gore in the show.  I'd like to see a scene or story where one or both of them reveals that they care, either romantically or platonically.  My favorite way to do this is through injury or some kind.  I'd love to see Alucard have to admit he needs help, for instance, or Trevor forced to admit he actually trusts the dhampir.

The Death of the Necromancer - Martha Wells 
Arisilde Damal (The Death of the Necromancer)

Romance fully optional.  I really wanted a scene with Nicholas and Arisilde, but for some reason Nichloas is in the tag set but when I try to submit it says he's not allowed.

I always wanted MORE for these two in the book.  Anything where they show their concern/regard for each other would be great, especially Arisilde getting a chance to help Nicholas in some way.  I always loved the contrast between Ari, the extremely powerful pacifist, and Nicholas, who is mostly average but ruthless.  Everyone underestimates Ari, even Nicholas, so something where he gets to prove himself maybe?  He has been a favorite character of mine for about 20 years so I'd love to see him again.

Nightrunner Series - Lynn Flewelling 
Alec í Amasa, Seregil í Korit

I loved this series so much, for much longer than I should have, and I still think the first 2 books are great.  I love the characters and the world, but I came to find the books themselves boring after the high stakes of the first two.  I felt like the series stopped holding my interest because the author was no longer willing to have Alec and Seregil face real dangers.  I never felt like there was any actual threat of death or bodily harm to either of them, much less tension in their relationship, so I'd like to see something involving that.  I always liked to see Seregil  hurt or in trouble.

Swordspoint was one of my favorite books growing up and I still reread it sometimes just because I loved Alec and Richard so much.  I loved how Alec was such an asshole but still managed to show his love for Richard.  I always wanted to see him push something too far, get Richard in a little too much trouble, and see how he would handle Richard getting hurt in a duel (even if it was just a regular fight).  I understand why she did it, but I've always been sad that Richard died off screen and of natural causes as well.  Would love an \"alternate\" death scene for him.

I just love Aaron and Darvish and I want to see them together.  Maybe a little jealousy or worry on Darvish's part, him having to go after Aaron either physically to save him or emotionally to win him.  Not really looking for sex but maybe some romance.  I have no issue with Chandra being in the story, I just don't require her- I do like her.

So Doctrine of Labyrinths is my FAVORITE series of books.

I love the characters, the deep and screwed up love they have, the intricate world building...all of it.  I would love any kind of tender moment between them, set anywhere during or after the series.  I especially like Mildmay rescuing or defending Felix, and there are a few parts of the books I'd love to see reworked along those lines.

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 
Attolia (Queen's Thief)

Irene! I think the way Megan Whalen Turner scrupulously limits our exposure to Irene and her thought process is genius, but it also leaves me...well, pretty tantalized. So I would love more of her - of her inner world, her decision-making, her her experience. 

I love her steely determination and moral ambiguity, the way we see how she's had to rigidly control her image and emotions and self-presentation in order to maintain her throne and defend her people, and the glimpse of backstory we get in <i>The Queen of Attolia</i> is devastating. If you want to run with that and show us more scenes of Irene's self-development and ascension to power, maybe places where she slipped and had to regain control, that would be awesome. 

I would also, like probably everyone else who reads and loves these books, be into more shippy Irene/Gen stuff (the scene in The King of Attolia where they're dancing and he pulls the hairpins out of her hair one by one until it cascades down...sexiest thing I've read in a long time), especially playing with how they navigated their messy, traumatic history together and what it means to love one another and yet to have hurt each other so much. 

Irene and Helen/Eddis interaction would also be very much welcome (platonic or not - though if you do ship them, I'd prefer you don't break Irene and Gen up to do that); I'd love to see an exploration of how they navigate their different relations to queenship and authority, and how they get to the type of trust and working relationship we see in <i>A Conspiracy of Kings</i>.

Penny Dreadful (TV) 
Vanessa Ives (Penny Dreadful), Hecate Poole (Penny Dreadful)

So. I adored <i>Penny Dreadful</i> but that moment in S2 when Vanessa and Hecate see each other for the first time across the crowded ballroom, and then Vanessa starts hallucinating blood raining from the ceiling? And then they <i>never</i> interact again? Most frustrating tease ever.

I would be interested in any ideas you have for giving us the interaction the show didn't, and am open to whatever directions you want them to go in. Enemies-to-allies(-to maybe lovers)? Darkfic of their continued battle, or of one taking the other captive? Deliciously fucked-up family dynamics with Evelyn and Sir Malcolm continuing their relationship? I could think of scenarios upon scenarios, but I'm really open to wherever your imagination takes you. Likewise, I'd be totally into something shippy with them, but just as equally interesting in gen that deals with their parallel journeys towards understanding their own agency in these epic mystical conflicts into which they were both dragged. I'm into the question of how their volatile and intense personalities might play off each other; please do run with it.

I love both Vanessa and Hecate as trauma survivors who are messy and ugly in their survival, who lash out and hurt others but are also trying to figure out how to live in their world, with their experiences. <i>Penny Dreadful</i> is also an amazing ensemble cast, and I would be happy to see other characters making appearances (maybe especially Seward, Dracula, Evelyn - or Brona/Lily, who doesn't really interact much with either of these women, would also be an interesting counterpoint), but I'd prefer the focus of whatever you write stay primarily on Hecate and Vanessa, especially rather than the male characters that tend to get more attention in our fandom. Likewise, I'm fine with Vanessa/Ethan, but if that pairing is present, I'd rather it not be the main center of the fic.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alabaster (Broken Earth)

Alabaster is my favorite, and makes my heart hurt and rejoice all at once. I know there were very good reasons for his limited presence in <i>The Stone Sky,</i> but I <i>miss</i> him.

So, please, give me more Alabaster! For this more probably than for my other requests I have a strong desire to see my requested character happy and in love, and if you want to go there I would be delighted (I loved loved loved Alabaster/Innon/Syenite, which was finished all too quickly for my wishes), but I would also be very happy to read more about his process of learning and exploration, his reckless and brilliant decisions.

<i>Broken Earth</i> has such dense, textural world-building, which we get largely from Essun and Nassun's perspectives, and I'd be really excited to see what some of the more haunting and mysterious aspects of the Stillness are like for Alabaster to inhabit. In particular, the Guardians are amazingly disturbing, and Alabaster's particular relationship with his Guardian, who he destroys and also saves, was really intriguing to me - I'd love to read something about what it was like for him to exert that kind of power, how much his choice came out of vengeance or self-preservation or compassion (which are so tangled up for him in all his decisions, really?), how he experiences the formalized and violence hierarchy which is the Guardian/orogene relationship.

Another period of his life which I'd really love fic about is his transformation into a Stone-Eater. I know we hear that his consciousness and memory are altered, perhaps unrecognizably from their original state, and I'd be curious to read an exploration of what that might be like for him, from the inside. Is their an ecstasy to that transformation, or a terror, or a relief? What does it mean for him as a culmination to all the losses of his human life? I'd love to read anything you come up with.

Les liaisons dangereuses | Dangerous Liaisons - Choderlos de Laclos 
Madame de Tourvel (Laclos), Marquise de Merteuil (Laclos)

The Merteuil and Tourvel never really interact in <i>Les liaisons dangereuses</i>! This has always bothered me. We get Mertueil making snide remarks about Tourvel's clothing, we know they've interacted socially, we know Merteuil is devouring all the details of Tourvel's conquest but...that's really all we get, for the most part. And I always wanted more; it felt like a missing piece to the elaborate polygon of relationships which is this book.

I feel like Tourvel is the moral center of the book in a lot of ways, and Merteuil's underestimation of her is crucial to the plot, but also means their interaction could be electric and exciting. Tourvel has actual principles, and Merteuil doesn't believe in those principles! What would that look like between them? Merteuil/Tourvel would be really cool, whether it entailed a straightforward power dynamic with Merteuil in control or something more unexpected and shifting. But a more ideological or intellectual contest would also really excite me. What if Tourvel became aware of the extent of Merteuil's manipulations in her life and decided to do something about it? What if Merteuil decided to mess with Valmont by manipulating Tourvel directly? What if Tourvel someone ended up as a support to Cecile, and Merteuil had to step in order to keep her long game moving? I'd be okay with some degree of Tourvel/Valmont/Merteuil for this prompt, but I'd prefer for the interactions between the women to be foregrounded, even if Valmont is the vehicle to get them there.

Chronicles of Prydain - Lloyd Alexander 
Eilonwy (Chronicles of Prydain)

Eilonwy is the beloved heroine of my childhood, and I so, so, so want more of her.

There are a lot of potential gaps to fill to do with Eilonwy's experience during different parts of the series, and I would be interested in reading about ideas for any of them; <i>Prydain</i> stays so tightly within Taran's perspective that there's a lot of room to be opened up. I am particularly interested in Eilonwy's relationship to her own magic and heritage and history, how she comes to integrate those elements into her sense of herself either during or after the series. Eilonwy has a wonderful, delightful whimsy and way of moving through the world but she is also holds a lot of complex contradictions in her identity, and it would be amazing to have some of those drawn out (those if you want to keep Alexander's tone of whimsy, I'd be perfectly happy to have that as well!).

I am also so, so interested in Eilonwy's relationship to Achren, both before the series and during Castle of Llyr. Achren was probably my first childhood literary crush, and I've always been curious what it would have been like for Eilonwy to grow up around this charismatic, gorgeous, powerful sorceress who was frankly pretty horribly to her while also (I imagine?) being something of a role model. With this prompt I'd be happy with something that stays within the type of tone and content of the series, but also with something darker and messier, if you want to go there. Dark!Eilonwy AU where she stays working with Achren after the abduction in <i>Llyr</i> (either of her own free will or through magic compulsion) would awesome and exciting and if you wanted to write fucked-up Achren/Eilonwy I would be totally into it (though, if you do so, please keep that with Eilonwy either at the age she is in <i>Llyr</i> or older, though I know the mentor/student dynamics are unavoidable and certainly part of the interest).

Dungeons and Dragons (Cartoon) 
Eric \"the Cavalier\"

This is one of my perennials because I never get enough! I would love Eric on his way to paladinhood (possibly kicking and screaming the whole way there), I'd also love Eric paired with pretty much any of the characters. 

Maybe a story about them getting home, and Eric becoming a paladin in OUR world, and having to make a choice to go back? I'd be interested to see him devoting himself to a real-world religion he was raised in (that he and his family possibly didn't take seriously) rather than to a Realm-based deity. 

(And as I write this, it occurs to me that Eric could be Jewish--I'd love to see him as a Jewish paladin! I don't see any reason he should kvetch any less just because he's got faith. :D But I totally understand if you don't feel comfortable writing that idea, so don't hesitate to give it a miss.)

I would love Menolly/Robinton if you can do it.

If not, I'd also love a story about Menolly having some kind of Harper adventure. Please no Menolly/Sebell, thanks (except if it's in the context of an overall Menolly/Robinton story in which case do whatever you want). I would also slightly prefer if you stick to the canon of the original Harper Hall trilogy and the original Dragonriders trilogy -- if you have some burning idea using AIVAS or something else out of the later canon go for it, but the tone of the later books feels so different to me, and they don't live in my heart the same way.

Dune Series - Frank Herbert 
Paul Atreides (Dune - Herbert), Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Dune - Herbert), Stilgar Ben Fifrawi (Dune - Herbert)

Paul is such a fascinating character and his power is equally fascinating. I would love a story that plays with it more, the way it sets him apart from humanity. You don't have to use either Feyd or Stilgar specifically, they just feel like interesting points of contact. 

One AU idea to spark you: if the Harkonnens hadn't killed Paul, if eg the Baron had been quietly forced by the Emperor or the Bene Gesserit to take Paul into his own house--I'd love a story about his power growing in that hostile environment, and how the people who see it react as this terrifying power swells out of their midst when it is a direct threat to them rather than a power aimed at their enemies. I can totally go to a Paul/Feyd place if you want to. 

If that doesn't spark you, maybe a story from Stilgar's POV seeing Paul's powers grow over the course of the period in the book on the way to the moment when he takes the Water of Life. 

One big request: please NOT the disgusting caricaturish Harkonnens of the movie if you use them, I prefer the far more compelling ones of the book.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Gaius Octavian (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005), Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005)

I was so disappointed in the way the show handled Octavian in S2. I loved young Octavian and his perception and brilliance, and then it felt to me like they decided to tell a story about how hot and awesome Mark Antony was (not wrong), but to make his fall more tragic, they turned it into a struggle between him as a kind of representative of pleasure and passion and Octavian as a weirdly repressed creep who made a bunch of stupid decisions and then won just because. 

All of which is to say: tell me a different story about Octavian as a young man? Anything you like, as long as Octavian is competent and thoughtful and thinking of Rome and the future. Feel free to ignore canon and history too for that matter. 

If that doesn't work for you, I would also love a Pullo/Vorenus story (doesn't have to be slash but yay if you can) set basically any time in the series. Optimistic ending preferred.

Ирония судьбы | The Irony of Fate (Movies)

We saw the hilarious surprise of Zhenya's friends when they realised that their friend's choice of fiancée had changed literally overnight. What about Nadya's colleagues, though? How would they react if they learned that the \"Ippolit\" they'd greeted so joyously was really Zhenya?

That's just one idea I had, but really, I'd love to read any fic that immediately follows the movie and keeps the film's perfect blend of pleasure, poignancy, and poetry.

At Land (1944) 

This 15-minute film is my favourite of Maya Deren's works and filled with scope for story, I think, because it's wholly silent while offering many provocative and imagination-stirring images. Could you write a story about what's happening during a scene? An inner monologue for one of the characters? A scene that took place before or after the images we see? A poem based upon the work? I'm really open to your creativity here and would be thrilled to read anything that the film inspires you to write.

Her narrating voice was wonderful, and she's a character I'd like to know a little better!

Flodskörden | Things from the Flood - Simon Stålenhag 

Possible prompts, if you’re looking for specific inspiration (some cloned from last year’s letter):

“Things from the Flood” is the start of this particular story arc - the sudden emergence of gory biotech with a mind of its own. What’s it like to be there at the outset?

The image texts suggest some form of xenomorphic evolution of native species. What are the implications for humans?

What’s the female police officer’s story? What has she found? Where does her job take her next?

The pictures suggest that Annika's boyfriend goes into one of the machines alone. What does he see inside? How does it change him? His appearance in the later image suggests he's not quite himself, but are the repercussions of going inside short-lived, or something he'll have to deal with for a while. Does he come out the same person at all? (Hello, cloned boyfriend!?) How much do they know about what they were exploring and what happened to him (if anything did)?

Why? What led Annika and her boyfriend to head out to these locations. A simple whim, or some larger purpose? Does Annika have an agenda of her own? Did she persuade her boyfriend to go inside? Did they find something in the first machine that led to them going to the towers/teleporters/biomachines?

What's in the pipes? Where's all that energy going? What are the other machines for? Why the gore? Why is the wiring/pipework so biological and haphazard in appearance?

Who (or what) are the (other?) victims of the machine - or is the gore part of the machine itself? Is that biological waste going anywhere? Will it do anything more than just sit there in a pool?

What role does Annika's relationship with her boyfriend play in this story? WHO needs to talk about Annika? Why? Where are the lovers in the final image? What kind of machine/structure is that, and what is its purpose?

Human society becomes accustomed to the new tech. But what’s the price?

The roadworker wearing the stimulus headgear - is he relaxing between shifts, or is it part of his job? What is he seeing/doing beneath the mask? What’s his life like outside of work?

Maybe the roadworker isn’t a roadworker. Maybe it’s some kind of scheme to hack or infiltrate the towers in the background. Maybe his colleagues aren’t resting. Maybe they’re dead, or suborned.

These characters have similar roles in their respective hierarchies - the early personification of power.

Song of the Sea (2014) 

I love how much all the characters grow, and would love to see that growth continue in a post-canon fic, or explored in a moment of realisation within the flow of the film itself. Or how Conor and Bronagh met, how they melded the magic of what she is into their everyday lives. Ben and Saoirse and Conor post-canon, and how their relationships evolve. How they feel about the sea, and the magic that's no longer such a tangible part of it. Macha and Mac Lir - the love and compassion that drove both of them, the safety in retreating to a life of stone, how they mirror Granny and Conor in the way Granny is so intent on safety at all costs and how Conor has pretty much stopped feeling at all. (Yeah, they're very obviously direct archetypes of the mythology, but how overtly do they understand what they are?)

I don't really want to give too many specific prompts for this, because otherwise I'll want to start writing them myself, and in a fandom this tiny what I want most of all is to see what makes this film so special for YOU. I trust you. Write the fic of your heart, please.

Rules of Summer - Shaun Tan 
Younger boy (Rules of Summer), Older boy (Rules of Summer)

What I’d love in a story for this fandom… okay, brace yourself for a brain-dump of ideas rather than a nice, clean set of bullet points.

Not a fic that simply retells a scene in more words, but one that unpicks it and makes the layers resonate. How does the (possibly allegorical) fantasy interleave with the boys’ lives before, after, or even (in a mundane, real-world setting) during the story? How do the ‘rules’ compare with the other rules of adulthood - and those of childhood? Why do these rules matter? What happens when you break them? How do the rules stay with the boys in later life?

What does the Crow want? Why is it always there? Where were the Crow’s people taking the younger boy? What was the older boy offered in exchange? What happens if you do miss the last day of summer, or if you can’t find your way back?

How about an AU where the book’s rules are broken and different rules learned? (Feel free to go full-on Crueltide with that, if it takes your fancy.) Or, the interpretation where the setting is more of a portal-world fantasy. How did the boys stumble into it, and do they ever return? Does anything ever come out of the summer-world into the real-world? Crossovers with mythology? Or with other portal fantasies (e.g. Narnia, Terabithia, Cooper’s Seaward, Pan’s Labyrinth, Labyrinth-Labyrinth, Dark Tower - and by all means deconstruct as much or as little as you want out of these fandoms/associated tropes, if you want to go that route). Character development - this is such a rite of passage story, one of those formative friendships that stay with a person forever. The kids learn and change so much. The best thing about YA fic for me is its focus on change, alongside everything else an individual story might be about. What’s the impact of the events of the book on these kids?

All of the above probably sounds like a request for twisted, plotty longfic, but please don’t feel obliged to go that route! Some of the stories I’ve loved most from Yuletide have been utter gems of 1k-ish words. You can do a heck of a lot with 1k, and often it’s all you need. So, just write what you want, or what works best for you.

What I would really like is a post-Willem Jude/JB fix-it fic that does not keep the ending of the original novel, but manages to treat both characters as flawed and human, and allows Jude some form of happiness. A friend of mine said once that she felt like JB escaped from a more complex novel, and it would be great to see Jude have to engage in that complexity in some way.

-Life after the task force - a fix it for her final episode that actually, properly wraps up her quest to see if it was her father and (for serious preference!) doesn't leave her dead would be awesome.

Big Wolf on Campus 
Merton Dingle, Tommy Dawkins

I've always loved this pairing. Anything involving them coming to realise that they have feelings for each other would be great. I've always liked the \"after high school\" stories where we can see a bit of what they've been up to since the story ended, and Tommy coming to understand how the wolf part of him will work in matters of the heart. Otherwise, pretty much anything that pairs these 2 will be fine.

Neighbors | Bad Neighbours (Movies) 
Pete Regazolli, Teddy Sanders (Neighbors)

The surprise pairing from this movie! I love these 2 guys - the smart and sort of sensitive one paired with the total jock. It's a stereotype but fun all the same. Would love to see how they get on after everything is finished, but also like stories centred on how they deal with the fallout of getting together in the environment of \"frat house\" politics and biases. Most stories about this pairing tend to be very inward focussed I've found - dealing with their own internal struggles, but would also like to see more about how the rest of their group respond to it.

Would also love to see a bit of an angst story, maybe set in the second movie and dealing with Pete's partner coming to realise that he's in the middle of something, maybe even before Pete and Teddy do.

Sky High (2005) 
Warren Peace, Will Stronghold

This is one of my favourite all time pairings, and I can't believe there aren't more stories out there. As with Big Wolf on Campus, almost anything with this pairing will be fine, except that I don't like the \"Warren becomes a bad guy anyway\" story. I don't mind other sorts of conflict or angst, but I've never liked Warren as a villain. Dealing with Layla, Will's dad, during school, after school, all those are fine.

Redwater (TV 2017) 
Andrew Kelly, Kieran Harrington

I would love something set either before the series, when Kieran and Andrew are kids fumbling through their feelings for one another, or when Andrew came to visit Kieran and Eileen in New York, or something set after the series around them trying to navigate their relationship - the last episode left things pretty open, but made it clear that these two just can't stay away from each other and their last scene almost felt like a declaration that they're not going to stay away from each other. Tell me about that, what to they do, can they figure this out? Or just give me a slice-of-life with the two of them together after the series, what are their quieter, more private moments like. Anything touching on the lingering trauma that both of them suffered from the accident and Mouse's death, Kieran's fear of water would be great as well.

Baseball RPF 
Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper

I just love the sort of mentor/student relationship these two have, how Werth looks out for Harper and is trying to teach him about the game and about playing outfield, etc, and Harper just totally looks up to Werth and almost seems like he's trying to emulate him in a lot of ways. Harper is like the over-eager puppy who gets into trouble but just really wants to please his team and play well, while Werth is the grizzled older veteran trying to keep the young upstart in check. I'd love to read something that gets into those aspects of their relationship, maybe surrounding their loss in the playoffs last year or whatever happens in the playoffs this year, or some hurt/comfort.

Give me all the Sam/Lindsay!

Backstory on their friendship or where they go from the events of the movie with Sam now learning how to be a better person and maybe guiding Lindsay in that direction as well. Or just some sex, I'm totally down for a PWP too.

The Demon Headmaster - Gillian Cross 
Dinah Glass | Dinah Hunter

Dear Yuletide Author,

This has been one of my favourite books ever since I was a child.  I think you could write anything to do with the world and I would be happy!  But what do I particularly like about?  I think it was the idea that the Headmaster had such power, that he could make you do anything - and yet despite that you could still fight back if you were clever enough and brave enough and willing to sacrifice yourselves to save the world.  

I'd be very very happy with any obvious 'Demon Headmaster comes up with Evil Plan, SPLAT defeat him' story.  Or Dinah's backstory has always fascinated me - bounced around foster homes and children's homes, learning to hide her cleverness - what happened to her before she went to live with the Hunters?  Alternatively I will always think of Dinah as 'my age', and I'm now in my thirties, so what happened to SPLAT?  Did they grow up, marry, have jobs and kids?  What would happen if they had to overthrow the Demon Headmaster as adults in 2017 instead of as children in the 80s?  

I adore the first two books which I read when I was young, but (blush!) kind of think of the rest of the series as fanfic that just happens to be written by Gillian Cross, so don't worry at all if you just want to treat the first book as canon and then go off piste.  But I know the rest and mostly like them, and if characters from later books show up that's great too :-)  I've never seen the TV show.

No real DNWs I can think of, although for me the Headmaster is always in it for the power and for making things neat and tidy and stripping away untidy emotions - I can't imagine any story where the Headmaster used his powers for sexual control ringing true for me.

While I like dark stories about loss of control and powerlessness, I also like cracky funny things too, and have a bit of a soft spot for crossovers, if you're sitting there thinking 'what I want to write is a Harry Potter crossover where SPLAT are magic and get sorted into Hogwarts houses and the Demon Headmaster tries to hypnotise Dumbledore' that is not going to make me sad :-)

A Saturday Life - Radclyffe Hall 
Francis (A Saturday Life)

Dear Author,

So, err, this is a really rarely read book by a pretty uncommonly read author.  I'm almost tempted to skip writing these optional details, as I find it so hard to believe I've actually matched on this one!  And given how miraculous and wonderful it would be to find anyone else in the world who has read this book and likes it enough to want to write fic about it, you can write whatever you want, and it will warm my heart and make me happy.

That aside, and with the knowledge that optional details are optional, oh Frances.  Frances, Frances, Frances.  The whole book leaves me in such a twisted conundrum of liking and respect and frustration and pity and love for Frances.  In so many ways, she's the one that makes everything happen - right at the start she's the one who finds Sidonia a dancing teacher, she's the person who knows the Ferrari's and introduces Sidonia to them, she's even the person who first says to Lady Shore that Sidonia must meet boys.  But all that happens grieves her so much, yet she never gives up her loyalty and love.  'So long as you're happy', as she says to Sidonia at the end (juxtaposing against her comment to David, in response to 'are you really happy?', 'No of course now, nobody is')

I think it's the ambiguity and the way she is always betwixt and between things that intrigues me - close friends, but never fully family, mannish, yet still a woman, and always torn between Lady Shore and Sidonia.   

Err, I guess that's more of a ramble, and not much of a prompt.  Just give me anything that gives me another view into Frances.  Whether that's her and Lady Shore, older and still content together.  Or some crazy fix it fic where Sidonia comes to her senses (or at least changes her fads again) and Frances has to stand up finally to the insufferable David and help her escape.  Letters from Frances, Frances's journal, any scene from the book told from her point of view.  What was in her mind during that unbearable scene where Sidonia, so full of teenage naivity, throws herself at Frances begging her to throw off her mother, and love _her_ - 'aren't I attractive?  I don't want to marry anyone, I just want to work and have you, all of you' ?  Sidonia thinks, so casually so much later 'I would have liked to take her away from Mother - thank God I didn't success in doing that, what a mess I'd be in now!'  Is she right?  Or is there an alternative world where Frances and Sidonia run off together for Wild Adventures?  What does Frances want?  Can she ever get it, and have a small slice of the happiness she doesn't believe in?

[Oh, it's a terribly long shot, but I'm guessing someone who's bothered to read A Saturday Life has probably read other Radclyffe Hall as well, and I will admit, I would love to read the fic where Stephen Gordon, Elizabeth Rodney and Frances Reide get together over tea (or something stronger) and have a real safe space where they are all variants on God's pattern together, and can talk and be understood (and probably bitch a lot!) ]

Master Song - Leonard Cohen (Song) 
You (Master Song)

Dear Author,

This song!  With all the Complicated Feels, and the Ambiguity, and the Imagery!  

There's lots of things I could say about what I'm looking for, but I don't really know what I'm looking for other than tell me the story that you find in the song.  I worry that if I say too much about how I read what's going on, that will muddy the water, and maybe the delight of this fandom is the scope for interpretation, and going where it takes you.  If your story was sparked by the song, then that's all I was looking for.

On the other hand, if your yuletide is full of Bears, and you want some inspiration about what I see in the song and what interests me, here are some vague notes.  Read them if you want to.

- The relationship of going away (with the Master) and returning, and the bitterness of the man she's returned to (your love is dust) yet his inability to leave her (your prisoner)

- and yet it's more complicated than that.  He sent her to the Master? (And I sent you to him with my guarantee)  He loved the master too?  (I loved your master perfectly) He was certain she'd return and still love him?  ( I taught him how you would long for me no matter what he said)   Was that true?  Or was the Master's spell too strong? She has come back...

- the power dynamics, the mastery and submission (will you kneel beside this bed ... a collar of leather and nails ...  your master)

- the religious imagery.  (wine and bread... some temple... he hands you the apple core...) Maybe there is a reading where the Master isn't another man she's left him for, but a religious experience?  Or both?

- that powerful sadness, that the man thinks she loves the Master because of the differences between him and the Man, some of which are choices of the Man's own making.  (I'm sure that he told you everything I must keep locked away in my head... he never once made you explain or talk about all of the little details)

- the hint that although the Master has given her total bliss (cruised above the ribbons of rain... erased the final wisps of pain) he has also failed her somehow (your love ... never stops not even when your master fails.)

- all the glory of sex (His body is a golden string that your body is hanging from) and the shaming of sex (your thighs are a ruin, you want too much... your love is a secret all over the block)

- the song is so one sided, and the Man is so confident he knows what has happened.  But is he right?  What story do we see if we give a voice to the Woman?  Has she come back to give crumbs to a prisoner she pities, while she's still in love with the Master?  Or is it all a bit more complicated than that?

So any story about complicated relationships, about loving someone, and loving someone else, and leaving and returning - particularly that strange dynamic where actually they both love the Master, and this whole situation has happened because of something the Man did to cause it all to happen - that would work for me.   But really, just go where the song takes you, if actually you just get one scrap of lyric stuck in your head and want to spin a whole story out of that, that's totally fine by me too :-)

Hello stranger! Happy Yuletide!

Here's the quick basics:

I'm gonna be so happy with whatever you create. I know writing for a stranger can be scary and anxiety-inducing, but the fact that you're writing for one of these fandoms at all is gonna light up my day.

I ship a lot of ships. (Lately my motto’s been “ship all the ships” for most of my fandoms. I can see the potential in almost any ship.) M/M, F/F, F/M, threesomes, moresomes, gen … it’s all good to me. I'm comfortable with a lot of kinks. And I LOVE getting smut as a gift. But I am completely fine with gen if you're not comfortable writing smutty stuff! A commitment to the universe and a faithfulness to the characters is what's most important to me.

My Squicks/Stuff To Avoid: major character death, major character illness, adultery/cheating, medical play, eye torture, gaslighting, incest, fridging female characters, demonizing female characters for \"getting in the way\" of a m/m pairing, Rape As Drama, A/B/O verse (I’m fine with it sometimes but only in very specific ways, so probably best to just avoid it for Yuletide), brutal unhappy endings with no hope in sight (except for The Screw Job fandom.)

Stuff I Like/Stuff I Love/Stuff I’d Enjoy Seeing: cuddling, bondage, whipping, knifeplay, gunkink, threesomes, femdom, FoeYay, female-character focal fic, cisswap fic, Christmas fluff, domestic fluff/curtain fic, kink negotiation, character A teaching character B to defend themselves, bandaging someone’s wounds, polyamory, couple locked in a room, first time, aftercare, role reversal AU, characters cooking dinner for each other, longtime crushes becoming longtime relationships, platonic sleeping together, general character exploration*

* You don’t need to include any of these, I'm just listing some things I like so you get a better sense of me.

My Yuleporn letter if you are so inclined: https://yuletide.dreamwidth.org/97180.html?thread=701596#cmt701596

Please don’t worry about trying to follow any of my prompts or adhering to them. These are just some ideas to get your creativity going if you want, and a way to show you my tastes:

1) Detailed character exploration of one or some or all of the characters I requested. Their life prior to the show, during the show, after the show, whatever you like.

2) Your take on what happened after the end. Theories, possible ideas for what’s going on with that show, anything that strikes your fancy.

3) Daniel and Irene, a rare private moment of intimacy on such a crowded show.

4) Sabina and Daniel in the woods, trying to find answers.

5) Cuddlepile for warmth, anyone or everyone.

These books have long counted among my most reliable pick-me-ups.

I nominated Gerry, Larry, Leslie and Mrs Durrell. I also love Spiro, Theodore, Margo, Larry’s guests, and Gerry's tutors (tree-fighting George!). I love everyone's dynamics with everyone. I’d love a brand new episode that focuses on any/all of the nominated characters, optionally including any/all of the others I listed.

There are many prompts in my letter!

However, if you don't ship it, a crossover (see letter for options) or an adventure that adds magic or supernatural elements to the otherwise canonical universe would also be great.

There are many prompts in my letter!

Biggest and/or Most Relevant Do Not Wants: unrequested romantic pairings (I especially don’t want any mention or foreshadowing of the canon het ending); major character death; bleak endings; alternate setting AUs or fusions (ex. modern, space, Hogwarts); “it was all a dream” endings; shovel talks; dark dynamics in my pairings; Dom/sub dynamics; asexual or aromantic headcanons; UST that never gets resolved

Hajime no Ippo | Fighting Spirit 
Miyata Ichirou, Makunouchi Ippo

See my letter for likes and feels.

Prompts: Fujii calls Ippo the Miyata Ichiro Fanclub President in the paper and it becomes a thing. In the future, Ippo retires and takes over the gym to continue the coach's legacy, and Miyata pretends he's helping only out of concern for today's boxing youth. Ippo keeps coming to Umezawa for love advice. Modern AU (or just future fic) featuring texting and selfies. Pornier edition: Miyata topping from the bottom. Shower sex. Blowjobs. Lowkey competing to get the other off first. And, I mean, if life hands you a canonically huge cock, it's totally reasonable to make size kink lemonade.

Prompts: Robo and Youzan texting (with bonus selfies?). The press likes to play up their rivalry (maybe they do an advertisement together?), much to Robo's confusion and Rion's amusement. Robo keeps coming to Tomoya (and/or Rion?) for love advice. Pornier edition: I feel like \"Robo and sex\" is a prompt in itself. Does he need help understanding the appeal at first? Does he get fixated on getting something absolutely right? Does he keep a running commentary? Is Youzan completely unprepared for Robo's everything? (Yes.)

Request 1 by Babie
Scarecrow and Mrs. King 
Lee Stetson

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I have many fond memories of this show, and completely adore Lee and everyone else! I’m really open to any kind of story for this fandom. Some examples of what I'd like to read are: a gen spy story, where something goes badly, maybe with Lee (and Amanda) and his (OC?) nemesis? Or a romance-focused story, maybe exploring Lee and Amanda’s relationship? Or else a slash story, for example Lee's former nameless male partner, that could happen to have been also his lover? I'd love a fix-it where he turns up to be alive, and Lee rescues him. Was he gotten captured and kept prisoner for some years? Was he brainwashed to have him betraying his country? Maybe the demise of his partner makes Lee aware of having been harbouring romantic feelings for him, and then the death man turns up alive and well and this forces Lee to deal with his feelings? I'd love an happy ending. Or a get-together, about Lee with a male spy, or counterspy. Or a dark fic where Lee gets kidnapped and tortured, maybe Lee’s old enemy is so obsessed with him that he kidnaps Lee to force him to ‘love’ him, with old-fashioned love potions, or having non-con sex with Lee while keeping him tied to the bed? 

About other dark routes, I’d love either Lee recovering after a (long?) kidnapping &amp; rape/torture/forced addition ordeal, or any other angsty situation. I love hurt/comfort with hurt Lee. I’d really like if there’s a sub plot with Lee getting together with a Russian agent or Amanda, but it is optional.

If my plot suggestions, or the prompt list here below, don’t work for you, I’d be thrilled also with a different story.

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Survival story. They are stranded on a desert island? Post WWIII survival story? OC finds and rescues Lee who was left to die on the desert?
• Lee &amp; his Russian nemesis team-up against their Governments to prevent WWIII?
• Mission together: maybe they get paired together just for the mission at hand and end up to like each other?
• Undercover as gay/couple, maybe it makes them realize/admit to like each other?
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Awkward situations
• Competent characters with agency
• Loyalty, Trust
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Lee gets kidnapped and brainwashed or tortured
• OC, or Russian spy, or Amanda takes him to his home to rescue/hide him?
• Any rating! Teen rated and focus on feelings is great, focus on feelings and some porny action to back it up is also great!
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•Consensual, dub-con, non-con, are all good with me. Yes to: vanilla smut, all the kinks, dub/non-con tropes like undernegotiated kinks, sex pollen, AMTD, they’re imprisoned and and one of them gets gangraped while the other is forced to watch, and so on
•Semipublic sex, awkward sex in uncomfortable places, lazy anal sex in more proper places
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Hurt/comfort: while sick fic is my least favorite kind of H/C fic I love H/C, I’d always be reading H/C stories, please more of it! ;)
• Watching over Lee while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Training ends up with sexy times.
• Sex bets stories
• BDSM, maybe with sub!Lee?
• R&amp;R or vacation together
• Marooned: for my m/m requests, the ship that find him/them is a cruise ship with only LGBT passengers
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on
• They meet each other while… on vacation at the same location! Or one character saves other character’s life, while pretending to be in vacation?
• Lee got hurt and is recovering when he is ordered to teach at the academy(?) for the duration of his recovery, other character is his student
• Genderswapped Amanda? I’d love to read an alternative take about her as a divorced dad with two children, when Lee meets her (him). :)

How the West Was Won (TV) 
Frank Grayson (How the West Was Won), Luke Macahan

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I love this show so much! I really enjoyed the portrayal of the old US setting, it had to me a flavor of realism and honest research behind the scenes that I haven’t often found in other shows or movies with similar setting. I love how they also handled situations and characters, as a means to explore the cultures and culture clashes of the people native to the places and the ones recently settled there. 

I absolutely love some of both the main cast and recurring characters, though my favorites are the ones I’ve requested, their dynamic, both smart and world-wise guys at a young age, the bad patch the two of them started off with. I love that Luke had to brave through one rough situation after the other! I love that the initial circumstance – Curt’s death – that brought Frank and him to meet each other made them enemies, and yet they ended up to be on the same side and trust each other eventually. I’d be happy with either a fic going on from there, making them becoming tight friends, then if you write slash, I'd also love if you eventually become lovers (I love tropes like enemies to friends to lovers, and enemies to lovers). Or else I’d be happy with a divergent canon story, maybe one that explore a different first meeting and get together instead of Curt’s death, that maybe bring them on different life paths too? Like for example, Frank not becoming a gun for hire, or Luke a wanted criminal; or maybe they are both those things but together they turn to a different path?

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Mission together
• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty
• Spy story, case fic, with foreground or background relationship?
• Undercover as partners in crime, maybe it makes them realize/admit a mutual attraction?
• Partners on the run, or simply travelling together
• Awkward or embarrassing situations, awkward or frenzied sex, semi-public sex, especially anal sex/intercourse
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
• Competent characters with agency
• Possessive feelings or behavior
• Protectiveness
• A character gets kidnapped and tortured, the other character rescues him
• Any rating is cool! So it is consensual, dub or noncon smut.
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Recovery from torture or rape fic, or generally any hurt/comfort fic
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued from the noose sentence or the prison by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Sex bets stories
• Undernegoziated spontaneous BDSM, maybe with sub!Luke?
• Watching over Luke while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Fight or gun training ends up with sexy times.
• Building their home together, life in the Old West
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on.
• They meet each other on a cruise

The Real Ghostbusters 
Ray Stantz (Real Ghostbusters), Winston Zeddemore (Real Ghostbusters)

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I'm also so fond of this show, Ray was my favorite but Winston was a close second, so I'm requesting them together. I'd enjoy many kind of stories, from ghost catching and then celebrating, to more serious stories like the guys having to resolve mundane problems, maybe they need a second job to cover all the expenses and Ray and Winston find a second job that gets them in trouble (take a stab at PI and that brings them to go undercover on a gay club -- and kiss each other to keep the cover?). Or Ray gets hurt in mission and maybe Winston has to patch him up on the spot because they are trapped there for the diration, and so on. But, if you write slash, I'd be really thrilled with slash fic, maybe first time, where Winston and Ray get together, or accidentally have sex and realize feelings, or other shippy scenarios with the two of them. :D

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Mission together
• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty

Conan the Adventurer (Cartoon) 
Wrath-Amon (Conan the Adventurer)

https://bahamut-255.deviantart.com/art/Wrath-Amon-Commissioned-from-ChatonBleu-553381774

https://68.media.tumblr.com/4a94ad23225d9e94e62c5734a93eef75/tumblr_inline_os7r78Vl1S1s5upnl_1280.jpg

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Bereft of the Black Ring of Set, Wrath-Amon has only his cunning, his instincts, his skills, the scales on his back, and whatever he can get a hold of to see him through this 'challenge'.  

2 - Over 200 years of servitude to his detested 'Master;, and every moment spent seeking a means of usurping him.  Now, with orders to Raid a Cimmerian Village for Star-Metal, an opportunity presents itself.  

3 - \"And what use would there be to such a thing?  To trade Power, for Vanity?\"  

4 - \"Barbarian Filth.  You're time has come.\"  

&nbsp;

The why:  

Wrath-Amon, the one-time Gila Monster Sniffer, remade into a Humanoid Lizardman before becoming Chief Servant of Set when he overthrew his former Master, Ram-Amon.  Which in turn saw him gain a new more human form through the Black Ring's Power so long as he wore it and it remained charged.  

This is a character who is actually relatively deep and complex in a series that had a series-spanning arc, given the design of the series (Saturday Morning Cartoon), with even his own origin episode.  

Wielding immense power through said Ring, yet paranoid about any and all threats - real and imagined - that could cost him what he has.  Commands a vast army and followers, yet they listen to him only out of fear of his own Master, Set.  Takes great pleasure in bringing suffering to others (most notably with the draconic Windfang), while despising his own past, his own origin, what he really is.  In fact, the one time he allowed himself to revert to a lizardman (then lizard) was the one time that his own life was dependant on it.  

AUs are a favoured theme of mine, taking what's in the series, picking out a POD and making a new world out of it.  From the small, to fate-twisting, to full-on mirrorversing (especially when the characters are still recognisably themselves).  

As for themes?  Well, Action/Adventure is preferred, though given the setting, Fantasy is good as well.

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RWda9ZlQ1es/U7xuVIjZsoI/AAAAAAAADB4/AvRIIvB8yqo/s1600/thulsa+doom+copia+copia.jpg

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - With the hand of Princess Yasimina in his own, Zamora was now, his.  

2 - Casting his gaze across the marble gardens, his cold slitted eyes locked on their target, already moving towards it.  

3 - A shame that the Boy had to die, but he had other matters to attend to.  

&nbsp;

The Why:  

Thulsa Doom, as a character, while not completely faithful to the works of REH, is still an impressive one in his own right.  One who seems obsessed with collecting as much power to himself as he can.  Hence why (in my opinion) he put an end to his days as a marauding warlord and reinvented himself as a religious demigod, commanding thousands of followers who would leap to their own deaths at his quietest command.  

The links shown at the beginning show him in the form I like the most, snake-headed, serpent-man - which the novelisation of the movie stated clearly he was, the movie being far more ambiguous with regards to just what he was - and I would prefer that that be his primary form.  

While there was a good deal of information given to the viewer, some of which was actually quite subtle and so miss-able on a first viewing, there's still plenty to speculate about.  After all, just how he established the Cult of Set isn't explained, nor how it spread so far, so fast.  

But it does tell me the sheer power and influence Thulsa Doom wields, having achieved so much in so little time, perhaps enough that he can safely show his snake head to at least his devout followers which I feel can be a good idea to explore.  

Intellect is something I see in him too.  His idea to marry Princess Yasimina being to legally secure the Zamarian Throne of her Father, Osric: the Usurper, being an example of this.  

One other detail I picked up on was the sheer lack of value he placed on his followers:  The aforementioned compelling them to commit suicide just to prove his Power; Scaling Up thus abandoning Yasimina to save himself when Conan and Co. broke in; Trying to Kill Yasimina when she was lost to him; And clearly placing far more value on his pet snakes as he bluntly stated himself.  A real Villain through and through.  

&nbsp;

Dark Romance, Fantasy.  These are the genres I believe would work here.

Request 3 by Bahamut255
Cinderella (2015) 
Lizard Footman 1 (Cinderella 2015), Major (Cinderella 2015)

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Midnight had passed, the Witching Hour was here.  Already beneath my hat and wig I could see my snout in front of me, my night of freedom fading into memory.  A pair of shoes flying loose ahead of me, the sound of tearing fabric over the rattle of the racing carriage.  

2 - \"Why do this to us?  Why did they not even ask?\"  

3 - How he kept his hooves and wide rump steady on the shaking, sticky carriage he didn't know, only that Home was in sight, just a few minutes more...

&nbsp;

The Why:  

While there's a good number of Stories in this fandom that give a lot of attention to Cinderella, her step-family, the Royal Family, and others.  There's really very little that give attention to these ones, the ones the Fairy Godmother would change into the coachmen and footmen for Cinderella for the duration of One Night.  For mere hours.  

In fact, other than a Cracked.com Animation and a few exploratory ideas, I can't recall seeing anything that really looks into this.  Hence my desire to see this done.  

And given how little is given, I can see there being a lot of room available for expanding on this idea.  

How do they deal with being made Human, frequently without even being asked?  Knowing that it's only for a few brief hours before the Magic fades, and they're back to their original selves?  

What would they be doing during the time alone?  While Cinderella is with the Prince, and they're waiting by the carriage?  

What would they be thinking at this time?  And during the Race back to Cinderella's Chateau as they slowly, bit-by-bit, return to their real forms?  

Their own dreams, fears, wants, and hopes?  

&nbsp;

I would like it if the Magic takes 60 minutes starting from Midnight (the Witching Hour of sorts) to completely fade, bit-by-bit, as so to allow plenty of time for them to really think about it as they lose their human forms.  

So Drama is a genre I feel would work here - and perhaps a bit of action - but not essential.  

&nbsp;

In the spirit of both the movie and the play, I will enthusiastically accept any content except explicit child sexual abuse. I will also enthusiastically accept fluff, because I always do.

Prompts: How did they deal with Roman culture and the death of their brother? Why are they so rubbish when the rest of their family is so amazing? Is it actually incest and why does no one comment on it?

Pierre Sanchez (J'en suis!), Dominique Samson (J'en suis!)

Do I ship it? Yes
Do you have to? A little bit

Everything you need to know about my feels for this is in my letter and no one needs that twice, so I've just copied the prompts for you. They're pretty shippy, but I am 100% enthusiatic about G rated, no sex fic, and if you have some gen shenanigans in mind, I would be up for that also.

1)Everyone turns out to be more gay than they thought: Dominique and Pierre end up together. Rose and Maude end up together. Everyone's happy and nothing hurts.

2)They're a couple (handwavey handwavey) and Pierre wants to be romantic and affectionate like everyone else gets to be, only he can't because he totally poisoned the well on that one during the 'pretend boyfriends' period and now whenever he tries Dominique assumes he's being patronising and sarcastic.

3)When I first watched this film, I genuinely thought that Pierre was bisexual and had been in love with his friend for years, quietly not mentioning it because Dominique clearly had massive issues around that whole area and that over the course of the film Dominique would get over his damn crisis, Pierre would confess, etc etc happy endings. You will fill a tiny hole in my heart if you write this for me.

Green Arrow (Comics) 
Oliver Queen (Green Arrow Comics), Dinah Lance (Green Arrow Comics), Roy Harper (Green Arrow Comics), Connor Hawke (Green Arrow Comics)

Oliver Queen does complicated and emotionally messy. Nowhere does this show up more clearly than in his relationship with Dinah Lance.

Two wounded people who often can’t tell each other what they need, who’ve lived so long with the mask, they’ve forgotten they can take it off.

Tell me a story of them and of the people around them. Tell me a story of them being brave, taking the mask off with each other, not just their clothes. This will be an exception to the no-smut rule, since in canon, bed was often the one place they’d be real with each other.

How does such a revelation (or the lack of one, if that’s the way your Muse bounces) impact Oliver’s sons? How does that change their relationship with him – or does it?

Give me the people-side of this – behind the masks, with the masks. How do the choices they all make affect them and the people around them – both on the hero-ing side and in the general population?

If you're not feeling a story with all four, I'd prefer one that concentrates on Oliver and Dinah.

I have to admit, I’m not as interested in the nighttime here, except as it purr-tains to the day. I’m way more interested in the people themselves than fight scenes. (see DNW list)

Past that, have at it! There are still a million-million stories in this Universe, and so many yet to be written!

Oh, one other quick thing if you would – please remember that Arrows Run Out. ;-D

It brought me great joy to see this in Yuletide. I’ve loved this commercial ever since I first saw it in its SuperBowl line-up back in the day.

So tell me a story of this world – why are cats herded? Is there a purr-actical reason? Is it religious or have other symbolic significance? Is it a rite of passage, giving prestige to the successful? Why (and how) does someone choose to become a Cat Herder? Or do they get to choose? Are they chosen instead? If so, how?

What is it like from the cats’ points of view? How do they feel about being herded? Are they happy? Content? Resigned? Outraged? Rebellious? 

Anything from this world would be awesome. (Paw-some? :D )

Scarecrow and Mrs. King 
Lee Stetson

There are depths to our boy – depths that weren’t all explored in canon.

Give me a story of those depths – how he feels, why he does what he does. Either a story from his past, before the show, or one from after the show ends.

How has his life changed over the years? With getting older? With developing a relationship with Amanda King? How has his life changed as the world has changed?

And, something that came to me as I was pondering my Yuletide choices – was that initial exchange really an accident, a desperation move that ended up working out? Or was it planned? Did the Agency have their eyes on Amanda all along?

This was one of my favorite shows back in the day, so any chance to revisit this Universe would be wonderful.

Tell me a tale – from his past, from the time Sam was in the Bar, something else that attracts you and your Muse – that shows us the passionate, loyal man he is.

Another thought – after the show ends, does he ever tell his wife about how he came back to her? Does she continue to remember the old time-line or does it fade? Does she encourage Al to try and help Sam? Does Al try? Is he successful?

This was another of my fave shows back in the day, so again, any Al-centric story you’d care to write would be most awesome + appreciated.

Progressive Insurance \"Flo\" Commercials 
Flo the Progressive Insurance girl, Jamie (Progressive)

I’ve been fascinated by the world that is being slowly revealed by these commercials and would love to know more. Any kind of day-in-the-life or other story about how things go and why would be great. 

Or maybe a story from their past – purr-haps the first time Jamie saw Flo and realized that he wanted to be a Progressive Guy as she was a Progressive Gal.

While not nominated and therefore extra-optional, it would be kyool to see about how extra-commercial things like the Progressive-takes-over-the-room phenomenon and how extra-commercial beings like Box fit into the whole scheme of things.

As far as I’m concerned, they don’t make enough of these commercials, so anything you’d care to add to the canon would be wonderful.

Eliza Doolittle (My Fair Lady (1964)), Hugh Pickering (My Fair Lady (1964)), Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady (1964))

I really don't like the pairing canon tries to push on us. I think Eliza and Higgins make great friends, but any kind of romantic or marital relationship between them would be horrible for all concerned. But I love all of the characters as individuals and I love the banter when they're together. So! Ideas, take as much or as little of them as you like, mix and match, whatever. Eliza starts up a business, either a flower shop or a phonetics tutor (if teaching phonetics, bonus points if she uses the \"Hungarian Princess\" mystique and totally pwns Zoltan Karpathy), while Higgins and Pickering are \"confirmed bachelors\" together (wink, wink) and Eliza and Mrs. Higgins commiserate. Eliza marries Freddy, because he's a good person despite being brainless, and she likes being adored, and he's good with the kids and she uses his social cachet to keep her business and the whole family afloat, and when his brainlessness gets too much they go and have dinner with the Professor/Mrs. Higgins/Colonel Pickering. Or what about Eliza, Higgins, and Pickering settling down together in a poly relationship, either as a romance or just committed good friends, while Mrs. Higgins sighs because they're happy but it's terribly scandalous, and if any of her friends (or the Bishop!) found out, egads. Or Eliza marries the Colonel because they're good friends and she respects him, and when they're no longer dealing with the training every day and Higgins is a visitor instead of their host and Eliza has a woman friend in Mrs. Higgins, they actually are quite happy and content together. Or Eliza stays with Mrs. Higgins for a while as she's getting on her feet (possibly starting a business?) and Colonel Pickering keeps coming by to smooth things over and ask Eliza back, and he and Mrs. Higgins get together and pair up while the Professor is loudly aghast and Eliza thinks it's awesome. Whatever you choose, banter and humor is the key to this (though I do have an embarrassment squick, so laughing with=good, laughing at=bad).

Random Harvest (1942) 
Charles Ranier | John \"Smithy\" Smith, Paula Ridgeway | Margaret Hanson

For me, this story cries out either for AUs or for post-canon stories.  What if he hadn't recovered his original memories?  What if he'd remembered, but hadn't forgotten Paula?  What if the baby lived?  What if she'd told him the truth, either right away in the interview for secretary or when he started seeing Kitty or when he asked her to marry him?  What if they'd gotten caught leaving town and he'd had to go back to the hospital?  And if canon stays the same, what happens now that he knows the truth?  Is he upset that she knew and didn't tell him?  Is Charles the same personality as Smitty?  They've both changed and grown a lot over the course of the movie--how does that affect their relationship?  Was she expecting that magically everything would go back to the way it was when they were young and in love?  Was he expecting that knowing the truth would magically make him feel more whole?

Metropolis: The Chase Suite - Janelle Monae 

I love these three albums and the associated art and videos. I don't have any specific prompts or plot bunnies, but here are some things to think about (mix and match as your fancy takes you):

The worldbuilding is exquisite, and makes me hunger for more. We only get a taste of this future. I want to know what makes it tick. I want to know about race relations, and the way human-droid relations map (or don't) onto modern white-black relations. I want to know how the economy works--these droids have some measure of autonomy and money, obviously, DJ Crash-Crash's primary audience seems to be his fellow droids. How does that work, and how did it develop? I want to know about computers and the differences (and similarities) between how droids think and how humans think. I want to know about Cindi's relationship with Anthony Greendown, how it developed and what happened to it once she goes on the run. I want to know about Cindi's relationship to her fellow droids (particularly the other Alpha Platinum 9,000s) and what it means to her (and to them) to be the Archandroid. I want to know about DJ Crash-Crash and his radio show. I want to know about the nightclub Cindi works in in Prime Time. I want to know about all the backstage stuff at the Metropolis Droid Auctions. I want to know more about the insane asylum and how magic, dancing, and technology interact. I want to know about that button at the side of the droids' heads, and what it means that when they push it they turn Black. I want to know more about Cindi's experiences while time traveling. Feel free to explore any or none of these ideas.

I love the neuro-atypical parts of Janus’s mind - the way he can’t quite figure out at times how people work unless it’s particular people he knows very well (like Winter).

If that doesn’t suit you, then I’ll be happy with anything with Janus, though I’d rather avoid romance.

I requested Breq and Seivarden, but apart from maybe Raughd there’s not one character I dislike in the whole lot, so any additional appearances welcome.

Shield of Tomorrow (Web Series) 
Rafael Martinez (Shield of Tomorrow)

My favorite episode so far of this show has been the I Remember episodes where we saw their backstories.  I'd love to see more of young Rafael, before his commission. Other ship assignments, time at the Academy, etc. Bonus points for past boyfriends. Bonus points for recognizable Star Trek characters though this is totally not necessary. I really just want to see more of the young Rafael we saw in his flashbacks. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to write a Sally Ride adventure with the rest of the crew, I love them all. I'd just like it centered on the Captain.

What they did in the year between outings, internal monologue, even what they were like before their lives were filled with Dread.  Include any of the other characters that you want (Sat is my least favorite, but I still like her). Fix-it fic that doesn't leave Tanner in the cave is also wonderful.

Literally my only gripe with these books is how abrupt the ending is. I want 3 more books about Damen and Laurent's road to ruling and everything they have to go through before they can relax-- because I can't imagine everything is smooth sailing after Kastor and the Regent's deaths, or even once they're crowned and trying to negotiate peace between two countries whose citizens violently hate each other. There are so many questions about what the future holds, and I'd love a story that answers some of them. But I'd be just as happy with fluff as plot-- they deserve it, dammit-- or any combination of the two.

Dark, twisty, intense-- this ship is pure subtext, but boy is it loaded. How long does their association go back; maybe to before Luci became a god? What else happens during The Faust Act that we don't see? I'd love a sneak peek into their relationship, all the intensity and possibility, and what it does to Cassandra when Luci dies. Also, how does that relationship bleed into their godhood? What do a past or future Lucifer and Urdr have to say to each other? As long as they're both always women, I'd be into seeing them in multiple incarnations. Basically I want something that explores all the darkness and beauty and pain that each of them holds in herself, and what is created when those aspects come together.

Kim Kyung-ho (King of Mask Singer), Shin Bong-sun (King of Mask Singer)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-In episode 87, Shin Bong-sun competed as Father Let Me Be The King but got knocked out in round one. What if she had managed to make it as King though? Would any of the regular panellists have realised who she was, or would they have continued to believe that she was a legendary singer?
-Kim Kyung-ho competed as The Lamp Genie in episodes 59 and 60, but he lost in the final match. What if he had taken the throne instead? Would he have tried behaving more like an idol? How much stick would he end up getting from the panellists and contestants, since it was fairly obvious who he was? Or, what if he goes on the show again and manages to bag the throne on his second attempt?
-Since everyone's got double identities, some kind of superhero/superpower/magical girl AU would be awesome. What if there are some strange goings-on in the studio, and the show is just a front for these magical individuals to gather without raising suspicions? How much do the regular panellists who haven't been contestants on the show before know? Would Kim Sung-joo be aware of these issues as well?

-Nish is definitely one of my favourite ever contestants, so I'd love to read something involving him. I know that Mark Watson wasn't nominated, but I really love the dynamic that he has with Nish, so something with team Wumar would be fun.
-What would a Losers special be like? I'd love to read something involving Roisin, Joe W, Paul, Lolly, and presumably Nish all battling it out to be the least worst of the worst.
-Joe Wilkinson was my favourite out of the series 2 contestants, so if you want to write something with him in instead, that would be brilliant. The show has a history of setting very peculiar tasks, so maybe Joe has to complete one that's so weird his first reaction's along the lines of \"really? you want me to do that???\" Maybe it's a task that Joe is unexpectedly good at, and he wins the 5 points far more easily than the others? Or would he fail on such an epic level that he gets constantly teased about it?
-I like click and point escape games, and I wouldn't mind reading about a task where the contestants have to get out of a locked room in the Taskmaster house. Would it be a solo effort, or a team task? What if the contestants have to solve extremely bizzare puzzles to get the key? Or what if the puzzles are so straightforward someone gets the feeling they've missed something, like how in the bridge building task in the final episode nobody noticed the three clues pointing to the wood under the table?

The Last Leg RPF 
Josh Widdicombe (Last Leg RPF)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-If you want to write a Jalex fic, I'd love something involving a moment from S1E7, about 18 minutes in, when Josh wore a mechanical tail that moved according to his heart rate, and Adam teased him by showing him a picture of Alex to see how the tail would move. What would have happened if Alex had worn the tail? Would he have used the chance to tell the audience he's in love with Josh, or outright exposed the fact they're already in a relationship? How would Josh and Adam react?
-If you want to do Jonnie/Josh fic, that would float my boat too. I've got nothing specific for them, so feel free to write whatever you want.
-If you want to write something else, go ahead. Josh is my favourite, so as long as he's in the fic somewhere, then I really don't mind what I get.

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-I'd really love an OT3 fic. If you want to stick to monogamous pairings, any combination works for me. P.S. you are totally free to write a PWP if it gets your fancy ;)
-The opening sketches to Flatslam do form a sort of ship-heavy canon, so I'd love something that's set in their shared flat. I'd also love it if you can work in hypnotist!Matthew somehow.
-They have, in several episodes of PBaM, discussed AUs like post-apocalypse, being stranded on an island, etc. I wouldn't mind if you want to write an AU that's based on those conversations.
-If you want to write something else, feel free!

In a Mass Knife Fight to the Death Between Every American President Who Would Win & Why? - G. Micks 

In the blog post, the author has set up a few rules: they’re in a space based on the Roman Colosseum, FDR has a badass motor wheelchair, etc. The author also details how they believe it went down. I consider these to be suggestions or assumptions, or prompts in their own right. If you want to bring other assumptions to bear, that’s cool.

You can take those rules and write any part of this scenario: the initial scene with a bunch of people, or the final standoff when only a few Presidents are left. You can write up an alliance scene mid-battle, or you can write up a single death. Five things fic is great!

Rush Hour (1998) 
James Carter (Rush Hour), Yan Naing Lee (Rush Hour)

This was the first Jackie Chan movie I ever saw, and it holds a special place in my heart. I love this odd couple who are both so devoted to their job, and eventually, each other (sort of. You know what I mean). I definitely ship these two, but if you don't, that's okay!

Prompts:
* What if Carter and Lee get together? For the first time! Maybe after a particularly tiring case? What's it like? What happens?
* Hurt/comfort? Especially if they just had one of those \"oops I accidentally punched you and now your nose is almost broken\" scenes?
* Oh no, for this case Carter and Lee need to pretend to be *married!* Surely nothing will come of it and no feelings will be revealed!
* Casefic! What is the next case they need to team up on? (I realize a sequel to this movie already exists, but I give you ultimate freedom to ignore or not as you see fit.)
* It's a heist! Do they need to get something back from the bad guys? Does it involve Carter playing some sort of a role?
* What if one of them invites the other to a family dinner?

They were together on the island for so long, obviously with a rivalry that eventually ended in a very close friendship. Again, I ship these two, but it's more than okay if you don't! 

Prompts:
* We don't actually see them declare a truce. How did that happen? How did they learn to communicate with each other?
* Kong is also in the tagset, and you can feel free to write about an encounter between Kong and Gunpei and Marlow.
* What if Gunpei and Marlow get together? For the first time! (I am a fan of simple tastes.)
* How did they figure out the horrors of the island?
* What were their first interactions with the Tagatu tribe like? Did the tribe take them to be brothers? Lovers? Friends? Dangerous outsiders?
* Take me through what it was like building that boat.
* One of my favorite parts of the movie was the music. Did they teach each other their favorite music? Did one of them teach the other how to dance?

Miss Sloane (2016) 
Elizabeth Sloane, Esme Manucharian

Pretty much anything with these two, ideally in a romantic/sexual context-- essentially my ideal prompt would be \"THE MOVIE, BUT GAY.\" I loved their chemistry and the complexity involved with Liz being a terrible person; how would that play out if there was also an attraction between them? Are they together when Liz outs Esme (and if so, how did that happen?? What was their relationship like?)? Do they have hatesex afterward? Does Esme come visit Liz in prison? What happens between them after she's released? I'd also be fine for gen versions of post-canon prompts that explore their dynamic, whether Esme forgives Liz or gets any kind of closure.

Failing that, I'd also be down for backstory; we know some things about Esme, but what about Liz's life shaped her into the barely-person she is? What if things were different? What is her life like after prison? Really, any kind of character study on either of them would also be great.

Basically any sort of look at what their lives are like after the end of the movie, or any look at what kind of queen Mia ends up being, or even a canon-divergent AU which preserves the initial animosity and belligerent UST between Nicholas and Mia (maybe he's the one she's arranged to marry? or he woos her while concealing the plot to steal her crown?).

Pretty much anything with the two of them together, along the lines of either romcom-y shenanigans or the sharp humor of the original video, would be delightful. 

Alternately, give me some meta-humor with Rachel the Ladyboss-- how did she achieve her high status? What's a day in her life like? Does she serve as a (hilarious and often on-edge) mentor to young aspiring Ladybosses? Does she ever find the answer to \"how much boob is too much boob\"?

Wonder Woman (2017) 
Diana Prince (Wonder Woman 2017), Steve Trevor (Wonder Woman 2017)

I would really love straight-up shipfic for this couple.  I found the movie so fun, and the Diana/Steve relationship was delightful and unique, albeit too short.  I’m less interested in the DC universe as a whole (although cameos of other DC characters would be welcome, I’m greatly prefer Diana and Steve to be the focus of any story).  In that vein, what about a modern-day hockey AU, where Diana is the first woman in the NHL, and Steve is the team captain reluctantly fascinated by her?  Or any of the fandom classics - high school AU, reluctant college roommates AU, detectives-working-undercover AU, band AU, you name it.  Alternately, if you wanted to stay a little bit more based in canon, what about a different setup for how the two of them meet: maybe Diana ends up in an arranged or pre-destined marriage with a human?  Anything that gives the two of them more time together or explores their relationship in a different scenario than the movie did is going to be marvelous.

Jianyu Li | Jason Mendoza, Janet (The Good Place)

How much do I love Jason and Janet falling in love and getting married FOR ACTUAL FACTUAL REAL in the Good Place?  A lot a lot, that’s how much.  I am utterly charmed by their surprisingly sweet relationship, and fascinated by the oddities of it: show!Janet is a real Good Place Janet, and has such an poignant mixture of knowledge and innocence, and somehow that ends up being a perfect match for Jason, in all his d-bag inherently sweet glory.  Prompts: I’d love anything playing with the format of the show (groundhog day loops! Janet needing Jason’s help after being rebooted each time! Jason keeps accidentally accessing pieces of information Janet has that can help them to escape!) or the strangeness of Janet’s AI falling in love with a human in the afterlife.  And I do love the rest of the cast, so feel free to include anybody else you want, if you’re keen to.  An ensemble-based fic about how everybody else keeps re-discovering and re-dealing with Jason and Janet hooking up/repeatedly marrying, would, for example, be amazing.

I inhaled the second and third books of this series earlier this year, and just love the world-building, relationship-building, and the everything-building of these books.  I really like Nevada, and I’d be interested in a fic dealing either either Nevada’s relationship to her family (because OMG, I loved all the reveals of everybody’s various talents) or her relationship with Rogan.  Feel free to focus on either of those requests and exclude the other - I’d love a fic about Nevada and her family (maybe vignettes focusing on the different times each person discovered their magical talents? Or future fic dealing with the fallout of the formation of House Baylor?) or just focusing in on Nevada and Rogan’s relationship (especially from earlier on, when they were reluctantly attracted to each other but skirting major issues: Magical sex pollen/fuck or die scenario?  A telepathic or soulbond spell?  A proximity spell so they can’t be more than a couple feet away from each other?)  Where ever you decide to go with this, I’m along for the ride.

Vagrant Story 
Sydney Losstarot, Ashley Riot

I’d love a story exploring the limits of Sydney’s precognition—how much did he know beforehand about the events of the game, and how much was he just guessing? Why did he pick Ashley? What does he know about the future after the events of the game? When it comes to Ashley, for the most part I’m more interested in the future than the past—what his plans are after leaving Lea Monde and the Riskbreakers, what it means that he’s now the Roodbearer, how those on the outside are going to respond to his apparent murder of the Duke. Speculation on the nature of magic in that world is welcome, as is any expansion on the glimpse of politics and religion we get in the game. If you want to include one, my preferred pairing is Ashley/Sydney, but I’m also totally open to gen.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

More than anything else, it’s really important to me that Laurent retains his edge—that even once he’s with Damen and happy, he still has his essential ruthlessness, his prickliness, and even that streak of cruelty that comes out when he’s hurt.

With that out of the way, a few more specific prompts:
- An outsider POV—someone in the Venetian or Akielon court, or a visitor from somewhere else, during the events of the trilogy or afterward
- The evergreen AU where Laurent and Damen met under different circumstances would be a delight
- A story about the two of them trying to integrate their kingdoms/governments—no doubt there are potential political problems galore
- If you’re feeling ambitious, I’d love to see an alternate ending to Kings Rising where, instead of getting derailed by Jokaste’s baby, they wage the full-scale war against Kastor that the first half of the book seemed to be promising.

- Elliot+Luke+Serene+Golden as a nontraditional family unit—how do they juggle the demands of their various careers, and what changes about their dynamic with Elliot and Luke’s new relationship and the addition of Golden? What assumptions do other people make about them? (Does Luke raise their collective kids?)
- An AU in which Elliot doesn’t meet Luke and Serene until they’re older—maybe Elliot never did go to school in the Borderlands, or went briefly and then left. Is he part of the invasion, or does he come to warn them? Or maybe he’s fleeing trouble in his grown-up life in our world, or Luke and Serene somehow end up here.

Decameron - Giovanni Boccaccio 

I love the Decameron stories and the way they're a window into Renaissance Italy and people's concerns and lives. Things I like about the nominated characters include: Madam Zinevra crossdresses, has adventures, and vindicates herself against injustice; Alatiel meets one irresistibly sexy pirate/warlord after another and eventually becomes Queen; and Abraham and Jehannot are merchants who are best friends despite religious differences. If another Decameron story suits your taste, I'd love a fic that draws from any of the stories - I like them all. Nominated characters, non-nominated characters, and original characters with a general inspiration from the source are all great. I love historical details, folk tales, alternative universes, and re-imaginings in different settings.

I love the adventure and the characters' different stories, and the way they reveal different parts of themselves and their backgrounds as you play. I'd love to read any kind of story that you're inspired to write for this fandom. I love Azra's sarcasm and humour, her librarianism, and her epic case of chronic protagonist-itis - I'd love to read what she thinks, writes, or reads. I also love Bakal's character and his backstory, the way he's changed over the years, how he's acted as a mentor for others while bearing the weight of his own flaws, and his seriously complicated relationship with Zelemir. I love older characters and the way the weight of their experience is so interesting. I also love Ketta and her toughness and propensity for adventure, as well as the self-contradictory aspects of her character - I'd love to read more about Ketta in action. Wrenna's time imprisoned sounds like it was very traumatic. I'd love to read more about her backstory (childhood or prisoner of war), or about what Wrenna does after the game is over with her new quest to rebuild her kingdom, and her relationships with her new dragon acquaintances (I love Niru too). I love Wrenna's resilience and determination even in horrible circumstances.

The Merry Widow is delightful. I love the comedy combined with such an interesting, passionate relationship at the heart of it. There have been many adaptations, interpretations, and settings - I'd love to read any version of the story, with one or more of these characters. I love the way Hanna and Danilo are so well matched, with Hanna's intelligence, pride, and kindness fighting against Danilo's own share of those qualities, and the way that Hanna's resilience and wit win through in the end. I'd love to read about Hanna having an adventure, solving a mystery or resolving a problem, whether on her own or teamed with Danilo. Or Kromow/Zeta slash would be fun. I like the joke in some adaptations: \"I love you!\"/\"Now, General, call me old fashioned, but I still prefer 'don't ask, don't tell'!\" What if Zeta and Kromow found love with each other? I also like Valencienne's character very much.

I love how Fanny's kind, contemplative, thoughtful, and stays true to herself and her integrity even when all the circumstances and the people she loves are against her. Some optional prompts: I'd love to read how Fanny continues to grow and develop past the novel, taking up new responsibilities at Mansfield Parsonage, learning to love it, and her new adventures. Fanny in a fantasy or science-fiction tale, or ghost story, would also be lovely. Fanny and her sibling relationships with William and Susan are warm and kind - watching them interact is great. Or alternative universe roleswap: Fanny Crawford is a shy bookworm spoiled and indulged by her father the Admiral, while Mary Price is a poor, vivacious foundling taken in by the wealthy Bertrams and her dreadful Aunt Norris - what happens?

I'd like to read your take on Xzar and his madness. Or I'd like to read your take on Aphril - I know she's a very minor character but she has very interesting abilties! A story set in Spellhold or Athkatla would be great, or an exploration of characters' backstory or futurefic. These four characters have a lot of options for dysfunctional, chilling, or ghostly stories. As an alternative, I love this fandom in general and I love being surprised - I'd enjoy reading an adventure with your favourite combination of characters, nominated or not.

Robin of Sherwood 
Guy of Gisburne (Robin of Sherwood), Marion of Leaford (Robin of Sherwood)

WANT: I would love a HET story in the Robert of Huntingdon era of the series, so with “blond Robin” :-), preferrably M or E rated. Guy of Gisburne and Marion of Leaford are my two favourite characters, but in the series they hardly interact, and if they do it is with mutual contempt and loathing. Hence, I love to ship them :-) If you could write me a story that centers around the two of them, I’d be very happy. You can use any of the other characters you like, but please keep the focus on them.

I prefer sexually laden stories. You can make it smutty romance, keep it more subtle with sexual tension (resolved or otherwise), or go the other way and choose something more explicit and rough. M but also E rated is fine by me. Don’t feel compelled to write a romance between them if you just can’t wrap your head around that! Dubcon, noncon or anything like that is fine as well. I honestly have no sexual squicks or triggers (when it comes to fanfic, anyway :-) ). I love romance, but angsty and dark stories just as much. It all depends on what you feel comfortable writing.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, or crossovers, please. I didn’t like the Knights of the Apocalypse audioplay, so I would prefer it if you ignore its existence in the fic storyline. The only exception: If you could write me a fic that redeems Guy after the things he does to Marion in the audioplay (something I can’t do anymore, which is the main reason I dislike the play), AND still keep him in character, I would be grateful to you until my dying day!!!

Atonement (2007)

WANT: I’d love a HET story about Robbie and Cecilia, preferrably something romantic and sweet. Maybe some hurt/comfort or emotional hurt/comfort? In this case, you don't have to include Briony.

Alternatively, you could write about Briony Tallis too, in combination with either Cecilia or Robbie or the both of them. Then I would not like it to be sweet, but more angsty and jarring, seeing as to what she did to them.

I like sex in my stories, be it implicit or explicit, depending on how it fits with the storyline. Anything from T to E rated is fine by me. I have no sexual squicks or triggers.

DO NOT WANT: No slash or crossovers, please. No stories that easily redeem Briony either (except if you precede it with some heavy duty angst and suffering first ;-) )

You Rang M'Lord? 
James Twelvetrees, Poppy Meldrum

WANT: I’d love a HET story that centers around these two, during the time when the Meldrums were rich and thriving. I like the dynamic between them in the series. James’ bashfulness and rigid propriety, Poppy’s perky, teasing, spoilt bitchiness. Please keep them in character but develop things between them a bit more. All this tension needs to be resolved! ;-) An unforgivable slip up from James, maybe? You can use any of the other characters too, as long as you keep the focus on James and Poppy. A look into the triangle with Ivy is also a possibility, for example. For this series I would like things not to be too explicit, though. An M rating, maximum.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, crossovers or AU’s please.

You Could Make a Life Series - Taylor Fitzpatrick 
Kirill \"Kiro\" Volkov (You Could Make a Life)

Likes for all requests: slice-of-life, characters in their canonical setting or in unexpected AUs (I'm a sucker for take-your-fandom-to-work fic), weird paranormal things happening in otherwise ordinary settings, soul bonds (though I prefer the trope to be played with a bit rather than completely straight).

Hard DNWs for all requests: substance-induced dubcon portrayed positively, gratuitous misogynist insults especially at male characters (\"make you my bitch\" or the like), cis-genderswap (trans or genderfluid characters are fine, cross-dressing is fine, shapeshifting that also gender-bends is fine in settings where this is a thing), relationship age differences greater than those existing in the canonical source (e.g., anything more than Corwin/Dara in Amber, Mike/Liam in YCMAL, Tacy and her canonical husband in Betsy-Tacy; use your judgment for others).

For YCMAL: I love Kiro and want him to be happy, and will be pleased with Kiro/anyone fluff or Kiro&amp;anyone friendship as long as it's happy.  

DNW: Kiro and Emily breakup - either they're together (open relationship as it is in canon is totally fine) or she needs to be handwaved out entirely please.

Las Chicas del Cable | Cable Girls 
Alba Romero | Lidia Aguilar Dávila, Carlos Cifuentes, Francisco Gomez

So many loyalty, identity, and daddy issues in this canon! In terms of shipping, I’d love Alba/Carlos, Alba/Francisco, Franciso/Carlos, or Alba/Carlos/Francisco, but would also be happy to see anything that takes place when none of them are involved with the any others. It's also completely fine if you're inspired to focus more on two of the characters rather than all three.

 Prompts that can be shippy or more gen:

·       Alba, Carlos, and Francisco attempt to figure out what to do during the upcoming coup attempt. Does one of them get injured? Are Carlos and Francisco adept at helping Alba plan in different ways? Do they have to take on other assumed identities at any point in the plan?

·       Anything surrounding the death of Carlos’s father/Francisco’s father-in-law. Does Alba help one or both of them process it? Does Carlos ever discover what Alba was trying to do about the will/why she was trying to do it? Does Carlos turn to Francisco or Alba for guidance/comfort in any way?

·       Is either Carlos or Alba able to find a way to get Francisco off on the suspicion of murder charge? Do they have to work with Victoria? Does she share any stories of Alba’s past that make Carlos understand a bit better?

·       Francisco or Carlos (or both) must work with Angeles, Marga, etc. to prevent a catastrophe (saving Alba?)

Ship prompts:

·       Two or three of them have an epic fight-and-fuck situation occur

·      Drowsy intimacy between two or three of them after a problem has been solved, or they’re done working for the day

·      They find themselves in a fuck-or-die situation, either in terms of blackmail or something happening during the coup

·      Alba’s saved everyone she can save (or has to promise to leave in order to save them) and Carlos and/or Francisco seek to find her, potentially getting together themselves on the way to her

Un Village Français | A French Village 
Anselme (Un village français), Antoine (Un village français)

I absolutely adore mentor/protege-ish relationships, and this is one of my favorites, especially given that Antoine and Anselme are both leaders of their respective movements, but, as everyone keeps saying, Antoine is 21 and so young while Anselme has more experience, but doesn't quite have the idealism or the restraint that the Resistance sometimes needs (though Antoine isn't always the most restrained...)

There are so many moments that I love between these two, from Anselme taking Antoine's face in his hands and stroking his hair (even giving it a little tug) when they're hiding from the Nazis and Antoine wants to go back and rescue his friends while Anselme gently tells him that he can't, and that the resistance needs his leadership, to Anselme shoving him away from someone's body and telling him he needs to \"learn when to shut up\" when Antoine questions him about why he blames him for the death. And then....oh man, Anselme telling Antoine to obey or get out and also telling him there will be \"no discussion\" of Antoine scouting a town to make sure the Nazis have left because of the risk of losing him vs. Anselme standing up for Antoine when Edmond says he's too young to be a judge. And I haven't even gotten to the part where Antoine puts himself between pitchfork-wielding Anselme and Alban with his knife....

Okay, so I love all these moments between them, how Anselme calls Antoine \"kid\" all the time and protects him and gives him orders, but also respects him, and how Antoine sometimes looks for that guidance and sometimes shrugs it off, especially when he differs very strongly from Anselme in terms of how he thinks a mission or post-liberation justice should look.

I definitely ship these two, but would also welcome Gen--anything about their relationship would be lovely.

Prompts that could be gen or shippy:

&nbsp;

·      Missing scene after Anselme and Suzanne storm the police station looking for Marchetti. Antoine quit off screen after that and Anselme seemed to know. I'd love to see that conversation, and also see what Anselme thinks about Antoine joining the military.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine disobeying Anselme and getting himself injured

&nbsp;

·      Post-war, Antoine putting on Claude's play and Antoine watching it

&nbsp;

·      Canon divergence where Antoine somehow ends up being taken prisoner in the school

&nbsp;

·      One taking a bullet for the other

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

&nbsp;

·      I love how Antoine's virginity kept being mentioned. Would love to see Anselme taking it.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine and Anselme doing the kissing scene in Claude's play, and what happens after.

&nbsp;

·      The effect of their policy/mission clashes on their love life. Is one better able to compartmentalize than the other?

&nbsp;

·      Post-war reunion fic, where they try to figure out if what they had was a wartime fling or something that could be more permanent

The Secret Country Series - Pamela Dean 
Fence (Secret Country), Randolph (Secret Country)

This series and its questions about identity and its emphasis on honor and loyalty and sacrifice just does things to me. I’m curious about whether Fence and Randolph ever felt their own ideas of themselves shifting in any way depending on what Melanie did or the children said. I’d also love to know more about Randolph’s training under Fence (does it resume post-canon?) as well as more about either’s point of view about the events in canon, or what happens after. Does Ted have to continue fencing lessons with Randolph? Are there any additional threats they have to contend with? Can they find a way to communicate with Patrick and Ellen (in the event they feel they need help?) even though they can’t go back and forth?

I ship Randolph/Fence, but am also happy with gen or either (or both!) characters with Ted or Ruth once they’re over 18. It's also fine if you're inspired to focus more on one character than the other.

Some more specific prompts that could be shippy or gen:

·      Fence and Randolph revisit the realm of the dead (and the ghost of King William may or may not play matchmaker, either intentionally or unintentionally).

·      Songs and stories that were once uncomfortable are comfortable again

·      One or both of them still feel haunted by the dead king and the dead children

·      Fence and Randolph reconnect while helping Ted reorganize the council

·      They somehow have a need to communicate with Ellen and Patrick and try to devise a way to do so

·      Ruth, Ted, or Laura tell them tell them tales from their world that resonate with Fence and Randolph

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help being intimate even during the period where Fence knows Randolph has killed the king

·      Fence and Randolph find a way to send intimate feelings/thoughts to one another even when they’re separated

·      All the h/c here. Maybe Randolph is a bit wounded after the duel with Ted? Maybe Fence’s magical strength is exhausted and he needs to be taken care of?

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help flirting in front of Ted while they’re trying to teach him. Maybe he wants to join in once he realizes what they’re doing and they let him once he’s of age? All the power/identity issues there would be amazing as well.

·      Does the Hidden Land have sex magic? Do Fence and Randolph use it to bind one another (and/or Ted or Ruth?)

Devil's Cub - Georgette Heyer 
Dominic Alastair (Devil's Cub), Justin Alastair (Devil's Cub), Léonie Alastair (Devil's Cub)

I am all about the Alastair family dynamics here. I love how cool and above it all Justin is (or attempts to be) with Leonie at first, and then with Dominic (the moment in Devil’s Cub when he learns from Mary that Dominic doesn’t consider him terrible comes to mind). I love that these family dynamics are caring (though that caring is sometimes disguised) as well as competitive (Leonie v. Justin fencing, Justin v. Dominic carriage speed) and would love to see how that started/changed over the years.

A few more specific prompts:

·      Justin, Dominic, and Leonie (or one/a combination) are set upon by highywaymen. Or either Leonie or Dominic pretend to be highywaymen (and if so, were they competitive with one another about it)?

·      In These Old Shades, Justin admits that he wouldn’t have taken Leonie to some of the places he did earlier in the novel—where might he feel he’s made similar mistakes with Dominic?

·      What did Leonie and Justin agree and disagree about with respect to raising Dominic? Which parent was more likely to intercede with the other in Dominic’s favor? What were some occasions where that situation was flipped?

·      H/C! I need injured Dominic in my life. A canon divergence where he is hit in the duel at the beginning would be fantastic—or it could have been an earlier duel, or something that happened when he was a child (either Leonie or Justin being rougher in fencing or what have you than they meant to be?)

·      Did Dominic ever have to cover for either Leonie or Justin in any of their adventures at any point?

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

I ship these two and am so happy that their relationship is canon in The White Queen, but would also be very excited to read gen about them. The weight of family history between them and the different way they feel about it, is endlessly fascinating to me.

Some gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth spends a period of time living with Richard and Anne as a child. Maybe she’s traumatized by George’s death?

·      Richard and Elizabeth reminisce about Edward after his death, remembering both the king and the father (and father figure).

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth sneaks away and accompanies Richard and Edward on their flight out of England when they’re betrayed

Ship prompts:

·      Anything that explores their different feelings about the incestuous nature of their relationship. Does Elizabeth ever address him as \"Uncle\" after they've slept together?

·      Anything about their power dynamics (Richard's \"I'm not Richard. I'm your king\" still gives me chills).

·      Post-battle sex, or post-battle diplomacy

·      Elizabeth wants to learn more about how to fight. Richard teaches her.

·      Very welcome kinks/tropes: Thank God We're Alive Sex, Spanking (Richard spanking Elizabeth either as play or as play punishment), Handholding, First Time Sex, Loyalty, Kneeling, Throne Sex, anything ceremonial, H/C

The Lion in Winter (1968) 
Geoffrey Plantagenet (The Lion in Winter), Richard \"The Lionheart\" of England (Lion in Winter)

I can never get enough stories about this canon! The shifting allegiances, power plays and masked, feigned, or exposed vulnerability get me every time.

I do happen to ship Richard/Geoffrey (and Geoffrey/Philip, and Richard/Geoffrey/Philip), but I completely understand if you don’t!

Gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Richard is king and Geoffrey is still alive. Is he Richard’s chancellor? Or is he in France with Philip?

·      Richard and Geoffrey on opposite sides of the battlefield (or the same side). What does “coming to terms” look like to them? What orders do they give their men about harm coming to their brothers?

·      Canon divergence where Geoffrey becomes king. I imagine this would only happen after Richard’s death. Ghost!Richard observing Geoffrey’s reign would be something. Or, what is Richard up to while Geoffrey’s king?

·      Anything about their early lives, either political training or military training, or other memorable family holidays

·      H/C! Injured or sick Richard or Geoffrey. Do they still bait one another? Does Geoffrey allow Richard to see him as genuinely vulnerable? Does Richard expose his own vulnerability to Geoffrey, intentionally or unintentionally?

·      Richard protecting Geoffrey (from their mother or father or John or Philip? From Richard himself?)

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      H/C with huddling for warmth that leads to more

·      Someone observes the two of them (from behind a tapestry or not), and with one or both of their knowledge (or not).

·      Richard is surprised to discover that Geoffrey’s a virgin. Does Geoffrey taunt him into doing something about it? Or does Richard make a suggestion Geoffrey won’t refuse?

-Richard domming the hell out of Geoffrey. Is this a case where Geoffrey resists this dynamic vehemently outside the bedroom but enjoys it and accepts it inside the bedroom, or does Geoffrey resist but secretly enjoy it in the bedroom as well?

Please do not include: AUs (though canon divergences are fine!), crossovers, under-18 sex, character death (except as prompted in The Lion in Winter)

I really love how easy it is for Ryouma to fluster Chizuru because he's a little more forward thanks to his familiarity with Western culture. I like seeing Chizuru deal with learning she's a demon and I think that would be especially interesting in this case because judging from Kyoto Winds we won't be seeing loads more of the shinsengumi? Shiranui seems to be tagging along with them so maybe she ends up asking him questions? 

Also would be up for an SSL-esque Highschool AU, as Ryouma's not in SSL what role would he have? A fellow student, teacher? A student at a rival boys school who tries to get Chizuru to go to their school?

I would honestly just be really happy to read more about Ryouma and Chizuru together and there's not much for them! Though please no major spoilers for the second half of his route and I'd ask that you don't make Kazama the bad guy as he's one of my faves.

Political Animals 
Thomas \"T. J.\" Hammond

TJ, to me, reads more as someone who has depression than an addict (mainly because I have depression and he's like me in that sense) – to me, the alcohol and drugs seem more like a coping mechanism than an addiction, though I don't think he or his family see it that way.

I love TJ, and I think he just desperately needs a friend he can be honest with and get support from! I'd love to see that happening after the end of the show - does he stay up at the farm? Take off to see the world? Get involved in some kind of volunteering, like building a house? Start a free food truck? TJ goes back to college? Getting to know Anne when she and Douglas first meet? Future fic after the election? Or even after Douglas (presumably) becomes president? TJ being the fun queer uncle after Douglas and Anne have kids? Or TJ adopting a child and being an anxious father?

Really, anything where TJ gets to be happy and healthy, and I'll love you! I'd prefer you not crossover with any other Sebastian Stan fandoms, please. I'd also prefer you not go non-show AU (space pirates, fairy tales etc). For other characters, I like Anne best, and Agent Clarke. I'm really not a fan of Bud Hammond.

General likes: hurt/comfort, mild angst, positive endings, friendship stories, verbal humour, mild teasing, future fic, stuff set before the show/book/movie started, slash/femslash, developing relationships, gen/friendship, caring and affection, queer communities, kid fic, kittens and puppies, bookshops. Kink wise, I'm open to anything except non-con/consent play.

General dislikes: humiliation, embarrassment, people being made to look stupid, outright humour stories, excessive violence.

If you wanted to go that way, I'd love to read Beth/Mindy femslash - I feel like they'd have an adorable, super-hot, geeky romance, and I'd love to read it. With the baby if you wanted to go that way - maybe Beth and Chris have an open relationship? What if they were together when Mars happened - angsty long-distance space romance? Or cute coded letters? Reunion sex at NASA?

Alternatively, I'd love to read a friendship piece between the two of them - bonding when Mindy's new to NASA? Doing a press tour after Mars? Geeking out together over the space trip? Worried friend emails between NASA and the ship?

Really, I'd love anything that involved the two of them, in canon universe or not - I feel like they'd make awesome space pirates, for example. 

I really love everyone in The Martian, so feel free to bring in anyone else you want to.

I love canon, so if you don't stay in the world, then I'd like something that has the same slightly out there vibe, rather than a \"mundane\" AU. I'd prefer you not crossover with other Jeremy Renner fandoms please, and I prefer Will written to be gay if you're going to write something where that comes up - if you want to ship him with any of the men in canon, please do, or create an OC boyfriend.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Matt Murdock (Daredevil Comics), Kristen McDuffie (Daredevil Comics)

I love Matt/Kirsten and anything relating to their relationship would be great. I'd prefer it on the fluffy side, for them, but I can definitely be cool with more serious stuff, especially if it acknowledges Matt's depression. Vol 3 and 4 are my ideal time if you don't want to go full au. I'd be interested in seeing if anyone could make vol. 5 work, but I'm not super caught up, so I don't know how that would go. 
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!

Mistborn - Brandon Sanderson 
Kelsier (Mistborn)

Anything involving Kelsier would make me happy, though I do love a touch of angst, maybe about the pits of hathsin and his ptsd. I like fluff as well, but I'd prefer it not to be too silly. Kelsier and Vin's father-daughter relationship is always wonderful and I love reading about it, as well as his relationship with Marsh and the rest of the crew, but there's absolutely no pressure to throw in any extra characters you're not comfortable with.
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!


Request 3 by Bluspirit92
Star Wars: Aftermath - Chuck Wendig 
Sinjir Rath Velus (Star Wars: Aftermath)

The angstier the better when it comes to Sinjir really, but feel free to make your own calls about how dark or sad or whatever you want to go. I'm fine with real upsetting, but I'm also fine with just scratching the surface. I'm happy with any point in the timeline of the series, pre or post series works too. I love Sinjir/Conder, but that doesn't need to play any role if you don't want. Sinjir and Jas's friendship is also beautiful, but there's no requirement to throw in other characters or relationships if you don't want to. 
Please nothing explicit. 
Thank you!

Prisoner of the Ant People - R. A. Montgomery 

Something pre-canon would be lovely. A different case tackled by the Zondo Quest Group, a story about the characters just hanging out in their downtime (my word, the Zondo Quest Group II group trying to do some sort of group bonding activity would be really…something), a more in-depth look at the activities of the ants’ independent activities, all would be awesome. Ships of all shapes and sizes or gen are awesome, though I’m pretty sure Rendoxoll has all the sex drive of a toaster. Also, please don’t feel pressured to keep the CYOA format or even second-person POV.

Or, if you want to go with kid!Alain, something with him and his sibs would be lovely. Bonus points for Fantine cameo during the applicable era, but absolutely not necessary. Also, given Alain’s age, I’d like genfic for this canon, please.

Gen or slash is ok, just please nothing rated “Explicit.” I’m ok with sexytimes, just don’t want it to dominate the fic.

I’d love to see some fic about Ulysses crew, in any combination of the listed characters or those crew members not listed (as always, optional details are optional, so if you want to stick to those listed, that’s 100% ok). Slice-of-life fic, either on the movie expedition, the previous expedition, or before/after the movie events would be lovely. I’m ok with gen or shippy, but would prefer that if you go the latter route, that you keep out of the “explicit” rating zone. Also note that I haven't seen the sequel, so don't feel beholden to stick with that canon if you're familiar with it.

I would love anyone (or everyone!) meeting Earl, if only so he can spread around some of the best tacos on Earth and make everyone's days just a little bit brighter.  Especially poor Rhetta, she wants so much to meet an angel and scientifically prove he exists.

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

general likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Dreams, nightmares, the subconscious, things said and unsaid. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. Weather: cold, rain, snow, wind.   

prompts: Slash, friends to lovers, secret and developing relationships. Pre-slash, something almost, not quite, maybe. Gen, comrades-in-arms, friendship. Post-canon: Did Collins see much more of the war as a pilot? How did or does Farrier get home? How, when, where do they meet again? (Preferably in the 1940s, though!) Collins and the Dawsons – acquaintances, connection, conversations, friends, help, support… not romance. Anything about flying: clouds, heights, the sky, weather conditions; adrenaline, danger, freedom, time running out, trapped, water… Almost drowning.

I’m fine with reading about phobias, PTSD and traumas, just not to the extent that they’d prevent these characters from ever leading independent lives. For post-canon: feel free to assume both characters survived the war and were reunited. I’m also fine with original characters appearing when appropriate, but please not in romantic relationships with the requested characters. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. Unrequested romantic/sexual relationships. AU (setting, sex/gender, age…), reincarnation, crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury (detailed descriptions of burns or loss of limb…) or fatal illness, character death. OTT fluff or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the 1940s. Tragic or unhappy endings.

Deutschland 83 
Alex Edel

likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. The subconscious, things said and unsaid.

prompts: Gen, friendship. Slash: Tischbier, someone else, no one in particular? Pre-canon: army days. Family. Missing scenes: I don’t ship Alex and Martin, but I’m fond of Martin, and Alex was clearly unsettled by the revelation. Post-canon: could be interesting if some of Alex, Tischbier &amp; Martin met again, months or years after the series (but preferably in the 1980s!). How Martin did and didn’t pick up on how the first two knew each other. Alex finding about Tischbier’s role.

I’m fine with the threat of HIV/AIDS affecting the characters, but don’t want to read about Alex dying slowly. Ambiguous or open endings are fine. I’m also fine reading about attempted suicide, depressive or suicidal thoughts. For post-canon, feel free to assume the shot at the end was General Edel, whether or not it was fatal – or even intended to be. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. AU (setting, sex/gender, age, orientation…), crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury or fatal illness, non-canonical character death. OTT fluff  or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the 1980s. Absolute tragedy.

Bernardo Gutierrez

likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Dreams, visions, the subconscious, things said and unsaid. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. Weather: rain, snow, wind.

prompts: Gen, colleagues, friendship. Ambiguous feelings, almost, not quite. Pre-canon: Gutierrez &amp; any supporting character(s) before the arrival of Pius XIII. Lenny’s enquiries about Gutierrez, everything there is to know. Missing scenes: Lenny &amp; Gutierrez, conversations. Post-canon: How about Gutierrez accompanying the Pope, travelling somewhere other than Venice? 

I’m fine with reading about abuse and addiction. For post-canon, feel free to let Lenny live and be Pope and Gutierrez continue as his secretary. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M.

DNW: PWP or kink. Non-canonical relationships; celibate characters having sex, unless canon. AU (setting, sex/gender, age, orientation…), crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury or fatal illness, (non-canonical) character death. OTT fluff or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the Vatican. Tragic endings.

Rivers of London - Ben Aaronovitch 
Peter Grant (Rivers of London), Thomas Nightingale

I love the humor - and the danger of the Rivers of London universe. Some of my prompts are about Peter/Nightingale's (real or biological) age and generational differences. Other prompts are the sexy shippy tropes of my heart:

• Aging at a different rate and in opposite directions: what if they meet in the middle? What if the age difference is the reverse of what it is now?
• Some insight into what Nightingale thinks of Peter's brand of magic and of his modern ways.
• Peter discovers a book of sex magic and practices it - on Nightingale.
• How would a bodyswap affect their magic? Exploring their swapped bodies, together or on their own ;)
• They pretend to be married while visiting a picturesque Stepford village on a case. Cue fakeout makeouts!
• They didn't know they were dating, to a ridiculous degree.
• A bottle-episode story involving Peter's new Ferrari GTO. That Nightingale more or less gave him.
• The Folly snowed in during a winter holiday, its crew being festive or macabre; extra love for the Folly worldbuilding
• Casefic: a scary modern urban legend or Lovecraftian/cosmic horror

Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Dickie Greenleaf, Peter Smith-Kingsley, Tom Ripley

In the Ripley universe, I enjoy the morally fluid characters + identity porn with its mental acrobatics + the dangerous closeted passions in the beautiful European settings. 

• All of three of them end up at Cortina, snowed in for days. Hoping for murder and relationship drama.
• Dickie/Tom: An in-depth story about how they spent their time together early on. More danger, more mind games, more innuendo, more sexual desperation.
• Peter/Dickie: I'd love to see this dynamic explored! Class differences and insecurities, bringing out the worst and the best in each other, being at peace - or not - with one's sexuality.
• Peter/Tom: How does Peter handle Tom's truths and untruths? All the complications here.

• A more in-depth story about how Su and Chow roleplay their cheating spouses. Extra love for a touch of the movie-like atmosphere.
• Su and Chow act out fictional scenarios as other random or movie couples as a turn-on.

Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song) 
Singer (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song)), My Lord (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song))

I saw Greg and CIaran at Shrewsbury Folk Festival this year and was blown away, and by the album (The Silent Majority). This is outright one of the slashiest songs I’ve ever heard. I’ve not been able to work out if that was deliberate - Bev Pegg, who wrote the lyrics, doesn’t seem like the sort of person who’d write that… but there it is. It’s full of hurt/comfort, but also a political undertone. 
I’d enjoy anything that adds a landscape around the events of the song - a backstory to the singer character, to the lord, to anything that’s going on. Or you could AU this to a different time and place entirely - perhaps they’re gangsters in the 1920s? 
Or you could go very detailed into what happens immediately after the song, while the lord rests, slowly dying, on the singer’s bed.

Archer's Goon - Diana Wynne Jones 

Diana Wynne Jones was and is one of my favourite authors, and has been since I was about 7 and read “The Ogre Downstairs”. There’s something about Archer’s Goon that I particularly love, though - not least the young boy with the fascination with spaceships which I *cough* might have identified with. And Shine, and Torquil… and Dillian. Feel free to write about any of the characters in the book, as well as (or even instead of) the ones nominated.
I got a really good story set after the book a couple of years ago, but I’m always up for another take on it. 
Exactly how is Howard going to “ensure Awful grows up right”? What does that even mean? Is he going to muck it up like he did with the first spaceship and the time thing? What can he actually do as his powers develop? Will he stay on the straight and narrow, or start cheating? 
How does Erskine fare after escaping the sewers? Of the good guys, he’s the one with the sharpest edge, I think. And does Torquil end up in his natural home, Las Vegas? 
Is there a chance that Awful grows up like Shine, as hinted in the scene where Awful visits Venturus’ temple? That might be a very interesting thing.
If you felt like answering any of these questions, that would be great, or you can go in completely different directions and that would be fabulous too.

'Allo 'Allo! 

I was, I confess, a little chary about including this fandom, given recent events. I love ‘Allo ‘Allo - I love the parody of (the excellent) Secret Army, the silliness, the way that pretty much everyone in it is an idiot. I could live without some of the treatment of Edith. 
Otto Flick and Helga… The canonically kinky relationship. I like that Flick thinks he’s amazingly competent (nobody in this show is amazingly competent). I like Helga’s constant shouting. I would love anything with these two in - perhaps with them questioning Michelle Dubois (also nominated)... and if you wanted to do something kinky, that would be brilliant, but it would be great if it was also foolish in some way (perhaps they are questioning her about completely the wrong thing?).
Michelle Dubois - I love the way she can speak English (done with accents), I love the mixture of competence (as mentioned above, it’s only… limited) and yet an inability not to get involved in stupid plans, and I love the catchphrase.
Von Smallhausen is a bit of a one joke character… which makes him ideal for fanfic in my opinion. It would be lovely to see something from his perspective - what does he actually think of Flick? What is going on in his (low to the ground) head?

1952 Vincent Black Lightning (Song) 

I’ve been a Richard Thompson fan since I first got played a cassette of Rumour and Sigh, and this is one of his great story songs. There’s a lot of characterisation of James in particular, and a little bit for Molly. There’s also a bit of sexiness here, not least in the motorbike itself. I’d love any kind of story that explored what happens after the song - how does Molly get on with the bike? Or maybe something that expands on the bare bones in the song - how does James Adie get a shotgun blast to the chest while committing armed robbery? 
There’s some space for kink here, too - “red hair and black leather”.

The Avengers (TV) 

I adore the Avengers. I love the artificial world (London streets have never been this empty) and the technicolor palette. I love Emma Peel and the swagger she and John Steed have. I love that their flirting always seems to be based on a mutual understanding of where boundaries are. I’d enjoy anything that felt like one of the series’ plots, or anything that got a little beneath that swaggering facade for either Steed or Peel.
There is so much possibility for kink here. Putting aside “A Touch Of Brimstone” (which is hot, but a little obvious, perhaps), the series seemed to love tying Emma Peel up - and only sometimes was she rescued by Steed. It almost felt like it was part of the plan. I’d enjoy anything that played with that, in any way you chose.

Blood Drive (TV) 
Arthur Bailey, Grace d'Argento

Arthur/Grace, with some real time to spare, like, at least a night without interruptions. As porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. If you wanted to incorporate some dom!Grace or Grace allowing Arthur to be tender with her and maybe even admitting to a feeling or two, I wouldn't object to it.

And/or if you had some typically Blood Drive-esque plot insanity or perversion (medical kink, anyone?) or serial killer AU or dark!Arthur you're dying to do . . . If there's another fandom's universe you'd love to subject them to (or v.v.) . . . go wild.

Whatever you decide, just please make sure they have each other's backs and there's a sense of twisted fun however dark it gets.


Request 2 by Bottomfeeder
Wolf Creek (TV) 
Eve Thorogood, Sullivan Hill

Eve/Sullivan, as porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. Basically, I think their time together was cut way too short and I would love a fix-it or at least an extension of their time together. An AU that branches off from canon or a totally re-imagined contemporary AU where they meet under different circumstances could be interesting, maybe where they have to work together on a case and kick a lot of ass together? There were some mythical elements to Eve's journey that I found interesting.

If you gave them something closer to a Happily Ever After than they got, I would give you huge bonus points. Especially if you didn't shy away from the dubious level of appropriateness of their relationship, but instead embraced it. Honestly, aside from their obvious love for each other, that's a big part of their appeal for me.

Mostly though, however simple or complicated you decide to make your fic, I want all the feels. Full-on emotion-porn is my absolute favorite thing.


Request 3 by Bottomfeeder
The Faculty (1998) 
Casey Connor, Zeke Tyler

Casey/Zeke, as romantic/porny - or not - as you're comfortable with taking that relationship.

Directly post-movie is cool and so is any AU you wanna do, such as no-aliens or Hellraiser or Blade Runner or whatever you want. It doesn't have to be a super-complicated plot (but that's cool, too!), I just want Casey and Zeke vs. the World -- whether literally or figuratively -- with them being really intense about each other and being each others' ride-or-die bitches. I'm fascinated about how they're kinda Opposites Attract but not really 'cause they're kinda two sides of the same coin. 

If you can work in some more in-depth exploration of Casey's affinity for photography, I would give you some bonus points, for sure.

I don't mind angst as long as there's light at the end of the tunnel.


Request 4 by Bottomfeeder
Washington Capitals RPF 
T. J. Oshie (Washington Capitals RPF), Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

T.J./Nicky would be amazing, 'cause there's barely any fic out there for that pairing, but if that's not your thing I understand. If you wanna throw Ovi in to complicate things, that's cool, too. I just wanna read something where Oshie and Backie together are the focus 'cause it's so rare to get a Backstrom fic where the focus isn't just him and Ovi.

Bonus points for porn, but not required obviously. I'd love some emotion-porn, too, whether that's platonic or otherwise. If you're going the non-platonic route, I don't mind infidelity or a not married/divorced AU. However you decide to handle the wives not being the focus is fine. Nothing against them, they're just not my obsession the way Nicklas and T.J. are.

If you wanna do some crazy Mafia or Harry Potter AU or keep it totally canon, I'm down with whatever inspires you. I don't mind angst as long as things de-angst themselves in the end. Actually, I love angst that turns into happiness. 

As long as they feel like T.J. and Nicky, I'm pretty open. Just please god no depressing endings. It's soul-crushing enough being a Caps fan most of the time.

SUPER EXTRA BONUS POINTS FOR SIDNEY \"FINGER-CHOPPER\" CROSBY GETTING HIS COMEUPPANCE IN SOME WAY. OR T.J. AND BACKIE EXPRESSING THEIR (MY) UTTER CONTEMPT. If you do not share my loathing, then probably best to just mention him as little as possible.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Matt Murdock (Daredevil Comics), Elektra Natchios (Daredevil comics)

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I like explorations of Matt’s senses and limitations in pretty much any context. The comics don't do a good job of giving him limitations (and the show is even worse tbh).

I like Matt being a control freak but still not having control.

I like Matt needing help, even if he’s shitty at asking for it. I like missing scenes. I like tough situations. I don’t have any really good prompts, I apologise.

For something from Elektra's focal point, I am interested in WHY Matt. Why are they drawn to him, why do they fight with/for him, why do they care about him. Elektra moves in and out of Matt's life. Why doesn't she just steer clear of him; it's not like she doesn't know he's a disaster? 

There’s some nonsense about Matt in my letter post, feel free to hop over there. AS A NOTE, I really am not a huge fan of how Mark Waid writes Matt. I like angsty Daredevil way more than weird, shave-my-head-wear-a-terrible-suit and have a manic episode Daredevil. I'm not saying DON'T WRITE WAID-ERA so much as I'm saying, keep some of his darkness if you can! I like his darkness. I'm not up to date on the new run of DD so avoiding that is probably best just so I understand the context. My fave era of DD is around the time he ends up in Ryker's when he's being all I'M THE KINGPIN. Though honestly, putting a story in any vague era is totally fine, canon compliance is definitely not required.

I would prefer not to have fic with Kirsten or Karen as a focal point. I also REALLY LOVE Matt's friendship with Foggy and if you want to talk about how much that matters to him, I am here for this! I think platonic relationships don't get anywhere near enough attention or importance in fandom. I don't ship Matt with Foggy at all but I love their friendship. Obviously I didn't pick Foggy here so if he's nowhere to be found that's totally fine as well - I just want you as an author to have more details rather than less? I don't know.&nbsp;

For these characters as a ship: I think this relationship is endlessly complicated because they have very very different moral compasses. Although I don’t think Matt’s is really perfect (especially if we actually count Shadowland as canon), it’s not anywhere near as off base as Elektra’s. And they’ve been enemies, but they’re not always. Elektra saved his life, after all! Like with Danny or Frank, I’d love to see WHY she’s so drawn to him, in spite of herself. What she thinks of the man that he grew up to be, and how they relate now. Also femdom here is totally appreciated if you’re into the sexy fic!

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I am obsessed with this world building. My big gripe about this book is there just was not enough of it, not enough backstory. The book is ALL ACTION PACKED and I absolutely adored every second but I want more. I'd actually love to have more set in Neverland, before Hook freaks out and decides he needs to go home, or something that juxtaposes their time in Neverland with their time in the real world. I'm also really into the idea of Hook teaching Peter about love and relationships and whatever.

They could have an adventure together (in either world).

Neither of them seems to be wired for quiet domestic life, not really, so how do they adjust to the idea of that? How do they spice it up?

Discovering the world and each other together, or going back to Neverland, or finding another fantasy, or more backstory, or taking what is already there and building a slower burn between them, I'm down for all of it.

I'm also obviously down for dirty dirty porn so if that's your thing, write that. 

I'm definitely fine with Ernest being included in any capacity; I didn't specifically request him bc I don't want a fic about just him but if you throw him in, that's fine!

Terminator Genisys

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

PROMPTS: The future being undone, the future NOT being undone, growing up a soldier, the differences/similarities in Sarah's upbringing and Kyle's, saving humanity, learning to trust a robot

I would LOVE to see something in the veins of the older films where the T-800 isn't just comic relief. Or combining ideas from the Sarah Connor Chronicles, with the machine ACTUALLY learning to be human instead of just being like super awkward for 40 years or something??? I would really like to see that.

I'm especially interested in Pops learning *from Sarah* how to be human. And I want Sarah to be MORE than just some incubator for the human savior. She's more than that and the older movies especially throw that away. The new movie throws it away less (which is part of what I liked about it), but I think it could go further.

ALSO I didn't like the gimmick of robot aging, so if you scrap that, I'm fine with it. (Actually, it could make a REALLY interesting time: how do they handle Pops not actually aging throughout all these years? I'm fine with his machinery wearing out some bc they don't have proper upkeep techniques but I don't see why the T-800 would be made so it AGED.)

Only thing I really do not want is NO PREGNANCY TALK AT ALL, no character death.

If you're including Kyle, that's fine and welcome, but I am not terribly interested in a romance with Sarah and Kyle. I don't think they're there yet. Exploring them learning to get along and maybe finding things that they enjoy about each other, a more organic thing than just \"we have sex and you die 48 hours later and I spend one movie and a TV series crying about what a great guy you were\" is great!

Mr. Robot (TV) 
Elliot Alderson, Tyrell Wellick, Edward Alderson | Mr. Robot

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

There is so much to explore in Mr. Robot that I'm not even sure where to start with it.

Even though Elliot and Mr. Robot share the same body, we see in s1 especially that they interact as if they don't. Mr. Robot looks like and is based on Elliot's dad, but from what we've seen of his actual dad, they're not actually the same. Before Elliot realises any of this, their relationship could be pretty much anything. Mr. Robot is bonkers and is willing to put Elliot in severe danger, but he's also willing to try to save him from it. Anything you want to do with that is fine.

For Tyrell, does he realise the difference between Mr. Robot and Elliot? He's pretty perceptive, and obviously he was working with Mr. Robot without Elliot's knowledge, for some time. What if he DOES know the difference between them, or figures out that two people live in Elliot's body? How does he purposefully interact with them differently? Does he play them off each other? Also, at the end of s2, he tells Angela he loves Elliot. Where did that come from? Fill in missing scenes, make something up, I don't know.

I love Angela so if you want to include her, please do. I don't really care for Darlene so I'd prefer she not have a central role to play if she shows up. 

AS A NOTE, I realise that the third season will have started by the time yuletide opens but I would like to request that you NOT write anything relating to the third season because I don't know how easily accessible it will be to me so while I'd like to keep up on it, I may not be able to and I really hate spoilers! Sorry about that.

National Football League RPF 
Aaron Rodgers (National Football League RPF)

I would really like a fic in which Aaron falls in love with a guy (or is in an established relationship with one). Anybody on his team would be great! I like coming-out fics if you'd like to write about how Aaron and his boyfriend become the first out active NFL players, but that's not a must. Hurt/comfort after an injury or defeat would be great, or celebration fic after a victory/record-breaking game. I love basically all the romance tropes, and I also really like the game of football, so if you do too you can definitely use all the detail you like.

If you can't see Aaron with any of his current teammates, future fic in which he's an analyst and falls in love with a fellow analyst would be cool too! Alex Smith, maybe? Colin Kaepernick? Odell Beckham Jr.? 

My DNWs are Aaron in a het relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and bodily fluids kinks.

For this fandom my ship is Ovi/hockey. No other ships, please (though Ovi teasingly flirting with everyone is okay, and pretty much canon anyways). 

So Ovi just started the season by scoring 3 goals in the first game and 4 goals in the second. Obviously this is not sustainable - or is it? Crack fic in which Ovi just keeps scoring hat tricks, game after game, and the team half thinks he made a deal with the devil, would be great. Does he start racking up superstitions and/or gameday rituals? 

OR I would very, very much like fic in which the Caps win the Cup, with Ovi scoring the winning goal in uber-dramatic fashion. :D

Or just Ovi kicking butt and taking names and playing epic pranks on the rest of the locker room between the kicking butt and taking names.

My DNWs are Ovi in a relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and the Chicago Blackhawks.

Tennis RPF 
Roger Federer (Tennis RPF), Severin Luthi (Tennis RPF), Stanislas Wawrinka (Tennis RPF)

Roger's the most successful tennis player of all time, and it's due in large part to Seve. What people don't know is that Seve isn't just Roger's coach, he's his dom too. Behind closed doors, Roger lets off stress by happily surrendering control to Seve and giving him everything he asks for. When Stan starts trying to improve his game, he comes to Roger and asks for advice. Roger points him towards Seve...

Any and all kinks are more than welcome here. Roger as an eager sub is my happy place, but Stan can be more reluctant/troublesome. And threesomes with Seve domming them both is good too. Public use in a locker room? Exhibitionism where someone might come by? Seve having Stan help him double-penetrate Fed? Seve making them play practice sets with his come in them? Get as FILTHY as you like! :D

(If you are totally on board with Seve/Fed but can't make Stan work, you can leave him out.)

If this isn't something you want to write, then gen teamfic or vanilla Fed/Stan shippiness based around Davis Cup is fine too.

My DNWs are Fed topping and/or being dominant, any mention of WAGs, anyone involved angsting about whether this is Decent, and paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death.

Benjamin January Mysteries - Barbara Hambly 
Benjamin January, Hannibal Sefton, Rose Vitrac January

Some of my favorite things about this series are the amazing historical detail and world-building, the treatment of complex real-world issues, and the kindness and respect and love of the characters for one another, as well as their humor and total dorkiness. I love how huge the world is; you could write a story about any background character and I would be fascinated by it. With Rose, I love her determination and stubbornness to have the life she wants, and how she's capable of being utterly ruthless when the situation calls for it. I also love her awkward, logical kindness. She tends to prefer books to people, and I am SO THERE with her. I love how cool and unemotional she is in a crisis, and her wry sense of humor at others' more dramatic emotions.
With Hannibal, I love that he is SUCH a fucking failbucket, and yet utterly aware of it, and how he's so grateful to those who are friends with him anyway. I really like the times when he manages to subtly undercut the privileges of his position compared to the others. I love how he makes friends with absolutely everyone he meets, and I love the slow growth over the series of his natural empathy, from a passive, fatalistic sympathy to actively going out of his way to do what he can for others. 
With Ben, I love how he is justly angry about the world he lives in, and yet how he manages to take that anger and turn it into working to make change happen. He has intense abandonment issues, and I love how important friends and family are to him, and how he is constantly striving to build a community around himself. I love his sense of pride, the way his desire to be seen as proper and respectable conflicts with his frequent attraction to people who are outcasts in one way or another. I love how good he is at code-switching and making people see what they want to see; he is a good man, but godDAMN he is sneaky when he needs to be. 

Optional Prompts:
– I would love a first-time, getting together fic for my OT3 set immediately after Crimson Angel. It’s such a dramatic book, with a ton of lovely tender moments between all three of them and so many fun tropes (Rose pretending to be Hannibal’s concubine! Ben thinking Hannibal was dead! Dramatic rescues! Bullet wounds!) and I really would love to indulge in even more of it. 
– I love canon-divergence AUs. One idea I was considering: what if Rose hadn’t been pregnant at the time of The Shirt on His Back? Would she have traveled with the others to Oregon? Or would Hannibal have stayed in New Orleans with her, leaving Ben and Shaw on their own? I would LOVE to see crossdressed Rose exploring the Wild West, but Rose and Hannibal forced to deal with his withdrawal on their own and despite societal disapproval would be excellent too. 
– EPISTOLARY FIC PLZ. I always love it when Hambly includes notes written by the characters in the books; I’m so fascinated even by little details like how they address one another (‘amicus meus’ is so cute it kills me) or how they manage to include secret messages that outside observers wouldn’t understand (whether that’s slipping into Latin or Greek, or codewords, or Shakespeare quotations). They do send a lot of letters and short notes in the books, and I’d love to see more of them: Hannibal’s letters from Mexico, Ben’s letters from Oregon or Washington DC, short notes during a normal day around the city, whatever.
– Loyalty kink: there’s a lot of moments in the books where one character has to simply trust that another won’t betray them, because they’re unable to talk directly due to outsiders listening in or them being separated. There are so many societal factors holding these characters apart, and I love how they work around them (usually subtly and sneakily, but sometimes very blatantly!) to maintain their trust and friendship. This is my JAM. Especially if one character goes through a period of angst, believing they might have been betrayed or abandoned, before the other(s) proves their loyalty by coming through with a happy ending. Examples from canon: when Ben is afraid Hannibal has abandoned him in Sold Down the River, before finding out that Hannibal was really kidnapped; in Dead Water, when Ben and Hannibal are unable to speak directly to one another to maintain their cover story, and are confronted by Molloy and Davis unexpectedly. The way they manage to back up each other despite having no plan is delicious. I just want to wallow in a ton of angst and loyalty and trust.
– I realize she’s not nominated, but I would also LOVE to get fic from Livia’s POV. Either backstory (a story about her as a child, as a young woman, from when her children were young, etc) or her view on a scene from canon. Or what does she think about Rose, about Hannibal, about the OT3? 

PS: I have already read 'Murder in July', so if you want to include details from that one, feel free!

Underground (TV) 
Cato (Underground), Georgia (Underground), Rosalee (Underground)

I am so, so sad about this show getting canceled (though I am holding out hope some other channel picks it up!) and so I would love fanfic as a chance to spend a little more time with these characters. I love the heist take on the material, I love the big action sequences, the huge twists in practically every episode, the gray morality and that there are no clear lines between \"good\" characters and \"bad\" characters. I love the exploration of an underserved area of American history, but I also love that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is willing to have fun with these characters and their melodrama. 
Cato is probably my favorite character (though I love the others as well!). He’s completely self-serving, ruthless, manipulative, cunning, and I love that about him. I love his dry sarcasm and the way he’s constantly pushing at others, testing them, testing himself. I love how he refuses to trust anyone else, and the way we learn he’s been hiding a deep loss all along. I want to know why he does what he does, what's driving him –&nbsp;though I suspect even he doesn't really know. 

&nbsp;

Optional Prompts:
– Backstory about Cato, since we know so little of his past. What was his relationship like with Noah before Episode One? Had he ever interacted with Rosalee before (it seems likely, since they both have relatively elevated positions)? What about his family or childhood? 
– The episode in Season One where Cato and Rosalee dressed up and pretended to be rich was THE BEST THING EVER. I would love a missing scene set during that time, or an AU where they had to stretch the deception out longer. What if they’d had to spend the night together? Just tell me more about their awkward intimacy! :D
– I'm pretty fascinated by Cato and Devi's relationship. I want to know all about it –&nbsp;what does she see in him? what does he see in her? Fic about their time together while Cato spends fortunes and self-destructs across Europe would be GREAT. I'd also be completely head-over-heels for any backstory about Devi: her childhood, her previous relationships, why she decides to follow Cato to America, any of that.
– I totally ship Georgia/Elizabeth and fic about them would make my day. Fluffy, angsty, first-time, established relationship – any way you want to go with it would be awesome to me. Georgia backstory would also be great: how did she come to make the choice to pass for white? What was her husband like? What is her relationship with John Brown and family like? 
– On another note, I absolutely love Clara and would be so very very into fic focusing on her. She's another deliciously ruthless character, and I am really enjoying seeing her learn how to get power and use it.

Books of the Raksura - Martha Wells 
Chime (Books of the Raksura), Consolation (Books of the Raksura)

This is very much an OR request (though if you can think of some reason to have them in the same room, I'm all for it!). In fact, I really love all of the characters in the tag set and would be happy with fic focusing on any of them; these two are just my favorites, which is why I chose them. 
I love this fandom for its incredible worldbuilding; every single one of the books has some setpiece that just fascinates me with its originality and weirdness, from a city inside a tree to underground pyramids to giant sea-turtles with cities on their backs to, of course, the Raksura gender/caste politics. I also love Moon and his struggle to understand Raksuran culture and the emotional difficulties of being part of a family and a colony; I love Chime's sweet awkwardness; I love Consolation's determination and misguided attempts to do good. 

Optional Prompts:
– I'd love more about Chime's transition from Mentor to Warrior, and all the many ways he must have had to adjust: mentally, physically, socially, etc. It might be interesting to see someone else's POV on that change too, or more about other people who have made the same change throughout history.
– Chime and Moon are obviously together, and Moon and Jade, but do Chime and Jade have any particular closeness? I'd love more on what they think of each other, or just see them spending time together, alone or with Moon as well. I could see this being either platonic or sexual, so feel free to go either way.
–&nbsp;I know this is probably what everyone will be asking for this Yuletide, but I am SO FASCINATED by Consolation. How does her setting up in a tree in the Reaches actually work? What about trading missions with other Raksura courts? Does she convince a consort to join her, and if so how? Do any Abora volunteer to join them and help them learn how to function? What does the next generation look like?
– I'd love a fic about Consolation as a young child. Maybe even from the POV of her father? What was that like, for him or for her, growing up in a place where they only had each other to understand them? A scene about her getting her name would <i>break my heart</i> in the best of ways. Or maybe a story about the father trying to teach her about the Raksura? Or one about Consolation making allies among the Kethel for the first time?
– I also really love Delin, and anything about him interacting with the Raksura would be excellent. Him asking questions to write his book? Him explaining to them about the Golden Isles or some other culture? Him helping out when they get into a tangle with another Raksura court? Just give me this fearless old nerd man and his curious lizard-bee friends and I will be ecstatic! His exasperated family is also A++.

PS: I have read all the short stories and also Martha Wells's Patreon, so feel free to include details from there as well!

A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara 
Jean-Baptiste \"JB\" Marion (A Little Life), Jude St. Francis (A Little Life), Malcolm Irvine (A Little Life), Willem Ragnarsson (A Little Life)

I would like a fix-it fic. Is that bossy? I can't believe that anyone finished this book and didn't want to fix at least some part of it, so. For any part or portion of any of this novel and of Jude St Francis' life: please feel free to pick the characters you most like, I listed the four friends to snag a match. I would be be happy with any way in which you chose to fix-it: are they women and therefore comprehensive psychological care is (almost) normalized? do they live in the future where induced amnesia is a palliative for trauma, yikes? maybe JB comes over one morning with pastries and talks about art with Jude? did Jude decide to stick around with Ana and go to UCSF and never meet Caleb, or anyone at all? (love the friendship vibes, but can you imagine Jude, trying out recovery, meeting Willem in their forties instead of their twenties? It'd be like a Slim Aarons photograph.) Did Malcolm say 'ah, let's build somewhere else' and thus the car accident never happened, and sometimes Willem awakens at night, cold, and wonders who he is? some of these are pretty horrifying as fix-its go, can you believe that Hanya Yanagihara edits the luxury supplement for the New York Times? all those years of writing about artful arrangements and elegant homes, and she just had to break characters who live so graciously. (&lt;3 you Hanya!) (I love her writing but I do think that something could have helped Jude.)

Dublin Murder Squad Series - Tana French 
Mick \"Scorcher\" Kennedy, Richie Curran

justice for this ship, they should've banged even though they ended their careers with the one case they worked together. They should've banged, it would be messy and ugly and hurt. Scorcher is my fave character in the books, and I think his choices are interesting. I am intrigued by the problems of masculinity: which, oh wow, there are so many, let's talk about marriage, responsibility toward ill family members, and guilt. Guilt, oh geez, let's talk about civic religion and who feels guilty about what, back and forth so many times like crosshatching for a scar. Let's talk about how they treat women, and if Scorcher is capable of trusting anyone (in a sexy way? or in an unsexy way. whichever!) I really like reading about miserable weather and Richie's lapses of judgment. I love love reading about garden variety selfishness and thoughtlessness. I don't think anything special needed to happen to ruin them, but that it did makes it all the worse.

The Goldfinch - Donna Tartt 
Kitsey Barbour, Theodore Decker

I like the Barbours, I like the bleakness of Theo's life even after the desert, I would love a story with a strong sense of place. I like the kind of drug and alcohol consumption in canon and don't think there's a problem with Theo making poor choices (two scotches and a pill before bedtime? sure.) I like au's and girl!characters:Theo's slump-hearted misery would be the same in any body. (Theo and Kitsey as women are basically a J.Crew ad for lesbianism.) I would love a story with references to art history and paintings other than the titular bird: surely Kitsey at least went to the Vermeer show at the Met? (I really like Kitsey! water-obsessed and pastelized as she is.) I would prefer a story that dealt with Kitsey and Theo within the canon timeline, when they are both making the best of what they're not quite enough happy with, although Theo doubts his ability to be happy with anything, and Kitsey's successes are hard glossy armor over an aggressive drive to never be caught out, it's not that she enjoys her affair, it's that she feels like running a four minute mile when Theo doesn't ask who's calling her. The inevitable ending doesn't have to be inevitable, either, if you like au's? I love reading about ridiculous New York real estate, Theo and Kitsey having an Instagram-worthy breakfast in bed while he's still hungover and she's lying, yes yes yes.

Dark Matter (TV) 
Three | Marcus Boone, The Android (Dark Matter)

Hello wonderful writer!

I love the weird curiosity/flirtation between The Android and Three. I was pretty much set on them from when Three gets all possessive of The Android and wanting to protect her from being wiped and I was stuck on The Android being flirtatious when she noticed how tight Three's bodysuit was

I'd love to see some awkward Robot flirting and some reciprocating from Three (whether he genuinely wants to admit it, awkwardly backhandedly flirts or feels oodles of guilt over it since she is an Android--and not even a sexbot! is up to you....i will welcome all of it) how far you take this ship is up to you but if you can give me some hilarious flirting i will be MOST HAPPY AND GRATEFUL omg *heart eyes* i also would really dig it if Android almost tricked Three into having sex with her and he kind went with it even if he suspected it to be a lie because he is SO WEIRDLY ATTRACTED TO HER AND HE IS NOT WILLING TO OPENLY ADMIT IT OKAY? wow, honestly all of it would be hilarious and adorable . i'm open to fluff and awkwardness and both of them being bad ass.

Hello lovely writer!

I'd love to read a fic where we learn to what extent Freya has emotionally manipulated Sara. I'd love to read how Freya projects her trauma and suffering onto Sara and to what extent Sara was manipulated and how she began the long road to break free of the toxic relationship with Freya.

I'd love to read a conflicted Sara who is part kind/loving towards Freya and part prisoner/deadly assassin loyal to freya to a fault. Freya who she recognizes as mad with need for revenge and self preservation but who also needs constant support. Is Sara the only one who is allowed to hug Freya? To speak closely without worry of retribution? does Freya dine with Sara and the other chosen warriors? does Sara finding herself devoted and defensive of Freya even though somewhere inside she still knows that she much escape with the others? Is there a toxic physical relationship that fills a need for intimacy between both women? How does her last night before her escape go? I'm just really curious here. I'd love it if it was romantically inclined (consensual, dubcon or noncon) or just platonic/friendship/loyalty  i'd just love to read more about this strange bond they have and how life in Freya's ice palace was for her and Sara

Gladiator (2000) 
Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (Gladiator (2000)), Maximus Decimus Meridius (Gladiator (2000))

Was there anything sadder than all of those longing glances from Lucilla towards Maximus?

Every word spoken between them was a tragedy, a happiness that could never be.

I'd love to read a fic where Maximus is still in Marcus Aurelius' favor as General and he really gets to know Lucilla. I'd love to read about Lucilla being young and confident and throwing herself at him in some very subtle ways that only Maximus would recognize.

Let me read about the love affair and happiness that neither ended up with!

(dearest writer, i'm okay with you foregoing an explanation for maximus' wife, or absence of wife but I'd rather not read about adultery... so if it's from their youthful days let them be flirtatious without hooking up, or if it's canon divergent then anything goes! all i ask is that there is no hate towards his wife/family and that it's all very respectful and he honors his vows --only coming close to being tempted to break them--)  I'm also very very okay with canon divergent where maximus and lucilla somehow make things work, or if you stay true to canon... lucilla uses her private time with maximus for sooooooooooooooooooo much good and that they make the guards jealous *G*

The Borgias (2011) 
Cesare Borgia (The Borgias 2011)

So, like a *lot* of people.. I'm *kinda* in love with Cesare...mostly to the point that I can't even pinpoint what I'd actually like to see out of a fic with him.

    So I've narrowed down that I'd like to read a fic where Cesare can pretty much do anything. He could focus on daddy!issues (he has a lot of them), or love on his sister (emotionally and/or physically...incest? sure!), or fuck married women (or Micheletto!) and I'd be soooooooo good with it... with only one catch, that his tight leather pants are mentioned. (and maybe his gorgeous hair)

    So let me summarize. Cesare + anyone + leather pants= EPIC WIN
**mega bonus points if you mention his beautiful hair***

Omg i'm reusing an old prompt from old YT because every year i put it on here cause I will ALWAYS want more Cesare prancing around in leather pants. But this year i'm thinking.. WHAT IF HE GETS A NEW TAILOR, and the TAILOR WHO MAKES HIS LEATHER PANTS HAS AN APPRENTICE WHO IS WICKED HOT and he MAKES OUT AND SEDUCES HIM IN ORDER TO STEAL LEATHER PANTS INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR THEM (or are they on the house? or is the tailor some sexy old man who gets handsy with Cesare in his leather pants during fittings and micheletto notices and says something? (kinda like on friends when Chandler sends joey to his Tailor and there is CUPPAGE) ahahhaa I don't know but let me tell you I never tire of asking for swaggering Cesare in leather.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Atia of the Julii (Rome 2005)

I recently watched this entire series and was blown away by the depth of Atia's character.

    I would love a fic that strips away the pushy, haughty Patrician Atia, and shows a different side that even she never lets us see on the show. The only time she ever looked vulnerable was when Antony broke her heart. I'd love to read whether she actually did love her husband, did she really love him? Did she love him so deeply and then get betrayed? Was it so bad that she told herself that she'd never be weak and in love ever again, and then Antony happened and despite her best efforts she gave in and loved him.

    I want to read about what makes her happy, truly happy. I want her not to worry about Atia the leader of a very influential household. Not Atia the man-eater.

    She seems so selfish and heartless, but she does feel things... she is a regular person (although she'd never admit it) so I'd love to read about her vulnerable, happy side

    Past!fic or Future!fic is great, i'm pretty much okay with whatever pairing. I'd prefer no incest. A story with any one of her lovers, or her husband would be great. Hopefully I've given you enough guidance/ideas to kinda see what i'm looking for lovely writer, but optional details are optional and i've left this pretty open to interpretation. I'm also good with any rating, I LOVE intimate moments where are personal defenses are down (not necessarily sexual, although that's more than okay) just the honestly and vulnerability of intimacy is awesome to read about.

I'm dying to know how these two met and how Menalippe rose to be her Lieutenant. Is it a physical relationship? or did she cry out from loyalty only? was there an awkward point where they were flirting and then had to ask each other out? did Diana help? or is this from before Diana?

Do they have spa days together when they're taking a break from the military? do they go to Hippolyta's dinner parties together? How do birthdays work?

I'm down for anything and everything. G-NC17, whatever you want to work with i'm good with... but I am soooo interested in the loyalty and love behind that despair and subsequent anger towards Steve Trevor from Menalippe when they are at Steve Trevor's interrogation.

I love this show, and I love all the characters, and I really, really love Janet. She’s so open and honest and she’s got all this backstory and worldbuilding the show hasn’t fully explored yet. I love the position they’ve put her in and the way we’ve gotten to see her change.

I ship Jason/Janet, but I love Janet-focused gen just as much, and I’d be delighted with either. For background ships/characters, I enjoy any combination of Eleanor, Chidi, and Tahani, and I have a soft spot for Vicki, too.

Please see my letter for general likes and more canon-specific information and prompts.

DNW: Dubcon, non-con, fic focusing on explicit porn/kink content, underage, major character death (although temporary MCD or minor character death in service of a casefic are fine), focus on terminal illness, issuefic, cannibalism, harm to pets

Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever (2014) 
Grumpy Cat (Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever)

Grumpy Cat! This movie was way better than it had any right to be. :D I love what Aubrey Plaza did with Grumpy as a character, and I love cats. Anything would be amazing.

Please feel free to go as meta or high-concept (or not) as you want with this one. I’m up for anything from a traditional fluff fic about Grumpy settling in with her new human post-movie to epistolary/Yuletide meta/script format/whatever other unusual format you’re interested in.

Lumberjanes 

I love Lumberjanes! It’s the summer camp version of Gravity Falls I didn’t know I was missing. :D I’d be down with a gift for any of the nominated characters and for any combo of the nominated characters. 

I love fic set at Lumberjanes camp, in the forest etc. around the camp, and in Bear Woman’s weird land-of-the-lost world. Basically anything where the Lumberjanes have to solve some sort of problem, whether that problem is supernatural or totally mundane, would be awesome.

I’m a fan of romance, adventure (especially quests!), casefic, plotty fic, fluff, gen, world-building and character studies. I am happy with any rating and any tone, from fluffy curtain fic down to pretty dark stuff. I usually prefer at least a bittersweet ending, though. I love fics that are realistic and I love stuff that’s tropey as all get out; go wild.

Some themes/tropes I really love include: characters fighting against/changing fate, everything about survival (what it means, how it changes you, the lengths you went to), the pressures and struggles of leadership, two people against the world together, found family anything, harsh/beautiful (or harshly beautiful) physical landscapes, gifts or gestures with intense or very personal meanings, anything where characters just get one another, characters who grapple with becoming evil or doing evil deeds, villains who believe they’re in the right, villains who just don’t care about morality, characters who are determined hope will prevail above all else, characters who really feel the weight of their heritage/someone's legacy and a pressure to live up to that.

I am also okay for you to use one, all, or any combination of the characters I’ve requested in each fandom.

DNWs:

I'm not going to lie, I ship the three of them. I love the fierce idealism of Ptolemy and Kitty, combined with Bartimaeus' cynicism and begrudging affection. I think they'd be great together if, you know, they weren't separated by 2,000 years, a separate dimension, and Ptolemy being dead. If you can finagle a way to write OT3 fic for them, I would be absolutely over the moon.

Other possible ideas: Ptolemy, Kitty, and Bartimaeus meeting in the Other Place, thanks to the mutability of time. Bartimaeus thinking about Ptolemy and Kitty and what it would be like if they met properly. Ptolemy gets resurrected, somehow, and chaos ensues. Alternatively, Kitty travels back in time, somehow, and chaos ensues.

Does the narrator chafe at being Gloria's second-in-command and grab her own turf? How would Gloria's plans for the narrator have played out? What about the arrangement- would anything have changed if Gloria and the narrator stayed together?

Body of Proof 
Megan Hunt (Body of Proof), Kate Murphy

All right, so I ship the hell out of these two and would love just about any fic involving them sharing snarky, flirty banter with each other and relishing being smarter and more fabulous than everyone else.  Smut is welcome, but please don't feel obligated to write it if you don't feel comfortable doing so!

The three major items on my Do Not Want list are rape, abuse (even in hurt/comfort fics), and gore.  I am a big ol' wimp when it comes to gore, and yes, this does sometimes present a few challenges when watching the show itself.  I'm fine with blood, though, so no worries there. 

Smut-wise, while I can definitely see their sex life being a near-constant battle for dominance (albeit with wonderful after-care), I'm not a fan of strap-ons or dildos in general.  Scat, watersports and age-play are also major squicks of mine, and I probably don't need to mention this, but just to be on the safe side (considering the nature of Kate and Megan's work), please avoid necrophilia and necrophilia-related topics.  I'd consider it a personal favor.  Also, please don't kill either of them.  My fragile little heart just couldn't take it.  

Apart from all that, whether you have them solving a case together, indulging in some hurt/comfort (goodness knows they both have more than enough past trauma to work with), figuring out how to navigate their somewhat rocky relationships with Megan's daughter and/or mother, arguing and then really enjoying the making-up process, or hell, even competing to see who can make Ethan the most uncomfortable, or just about any other scenario you feel like putting them in, as long as Kate and Megan are being snarky and fabulous, I'm probably going to be happy.

Jem and the Holograms (Comics) 
Mary \"Stormer\" Phillips (Jem Comics), Roxanne \"Roxy\" Pellegrini (Jem Comics), Phyllis \"Pizzazz\" Gabor (Jem Comics), Sheila \"Jetta\" Burns (Jem Comics)

Whether we're talking about the show or the comics, in my opinion the Misfits are the best part of Jem and the Holograms.  Their songs ARE better, after all.  Anyway, I'd love a fic that was just about the Misfits being their fabulously tacky and bratty selves.  Bonus points for wacky antics, especially the kind that, logically, they probably ought to be arrested for, although since when have Misfits had any use for logic (apart from Stormer, sometimes)?  Even more bonus points for femmeslash.  My favorite pairings are Kimber/Stormer and Pizzazz/Roxy, but feel free to mix it up a bit!  Go wild!  Smut is welcome, but I won't be disappointed if you'd rather not go there.

Again, I'm not a fan of rape, abuse, gore, scat/watersports, ageplay or strap-ons/dildos.  And as far as this fandom goes, I'm not super interested in \"serious\" topics at all.  The Misfits are far too busy being flawless, gorgeous and magnificent to worry about silly things like consequences, propriety, introspection and emotional maturity.  The bottom line is, I want you to enjoy writing this as much as possible, dear author!   The more fun you have writing this story, the more fun I'm probably gonna have reading it.

If you want to write smut, I certainly won't object as long as they're both legal, consenting adults when it takes place.  Hurt/comfort would be awesome ('cause let's face it, they've both got ISSUES), team-ups with the rest of Mystery Incorporated would be fantastic, and you can never go wrong with a Vincent Van Ghoul and/or Professor Hatecraft and/or Hex Girls cameo.  Again, the more fun you have writing this fic, the more likely I am to love the hell out of it!

Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Kalr Five | Ettan, Medic (Mercy of Kalr), Athoek Station, Lieutenant Tisarwat

I adore almost everything about these books, but there’s a special place in my heart for Kalr Five, Tisarwat, Medic and Athoek Station. I would love to read something about any combination of them working together to achieve something unlikely to be fatal – say, preparations for the Conclave? Or a dinner party (Kalr Five’s dedication to propriety in the matter of tea sets is always delightful)? Or something to do with restoring those gardens on the Station, or the improvements to the Undergarden (beset-but-competent administrator Tisarwat is probably my favourite Tisarwat)…

Alternatively, things have gone wrong already and now Medic is having a very, very bad day with some very, very bad patients. Because they’d definitely be bad patients, in their own ways.

Points - Melissa Scott & Lisa A. Barnett 
Philip Eslingen, Nicolas Rathe, Istre b'Estorr

This series is one of my favourite examples of worldbuilding in current fantasy, so I’d love something that branches out and explores the world beyond what we’ve seen already in the books. I like Eslingen, Rathe and b’Estorr, but Eslingen most of all, and I’m really interested in his soldiering past and how he started to move back toward that, in a different way, in Fair’s Point, so anything that deals with the City Guard and his role in shaping it/deciding how it operates would be wonderful, especially if it involves conflict with the Points, and/or that King of Thieves (horses with personality = love). Casefic would be *adored*.

Call the Midwife 
Julienne (Call the Midwife), Evangelina (Call the Midwife), Phyllis Crane, Barbara Gilbert

If there’s one thing I love about *Call the Midwife* more than anything else, it’s Phyllis Crane’s friendship with Barbara Gilbert, and how it so often reverses roles, with Phyllis the apparently plain, stodgy, moralistic older woman surprising sparky-but-conventional young thing Barbara with her past and flexible viewpoints (and Phyllis as Barbara’s bridesmaid was an absolute delight!). They have a great working dynamic, and I’d love to see them working together on something like a public health issue, either before Barbara’s marriage or after it. And maybe, for a change, Barbara cna surprise Phyllis. :)

I also love both Sister Evangelina and Sister Julienne, and find the contrast between Sister Julienne’s serenity and her difficulty with accepting change very interesting; I suspect that one of the reasons Julienne and Evangalina didn’t butt heads as often as they might have was because Evangelia shared that conservatism, so anything about how their relationships works—and the moments when it doesn’t work—or how the arrival of someone like Phyllis or Barbara challenges one or both of them would be lovely.

I know it’s weird having ‘no birth scenes’ in my DNWs for a show about midwives, but we get enough of those in the show itself, so medical casefic that’s not about birth is what I would prefer if casefic takes your fancy here.

DNWs: any explicit sexual content, any explicit romantic content, blood, gore and injury beyond what’s in canon (but no uterine inversions please! I can’t cope with that again…), birth scenes, major character deaths outside of what’s canon.

Humans (TV) 
Mattie Hawkins, Odi (Humans), Niska (Humans)

I love this show so much, but never even thought about fic for it until I saw it in the tagset and had a brainwave. One of my favourite plot strands in season 2 was Mattie trying to restore Odi, and his struggle to deal with consciousness. I’d love to see something about the longer-term impact of his ‘suicide’ on her, and how it affects her relationships with the conscious Synths. Or, did the code push reawaken Odi? If it did, how does he react? Would he come to Mattie for help, or strike out on his own? What would happen if he crossed paths with Niska?

Or Mattie and Niska each figuring out what to do next in the aftermath of the Synth Awakening would be interesting too—there are a lot of parallels between them that I'd love to see explored.

Count Dracula (TV 1977) 
Renfield (Count Dracula 1977), Mina Westenra Harker (Count Dracula 1977), Dracula (Count Dracula 1977), Jonathan Harker (Count Dracula 1977)

What if Renfield did as Dracula wanted? What if he hadn’t tried to warn Seward and instead did as Dracula expected and drank from an “initiated human”—meaning Mina, somehow, while Jonathan and Seward were in shouting distance? Mina might do likewise, being in Dracula’s power at that moment from all that was implied. Or maybe it’s her choice. How would this work without drawing attention, and how would the men not notice?

Does Jonathan notice anything odd about her at all later? Does Dracula encourage Mina to “initiate” Jonathan, turning him and also providing Dracula’s own blood to do so faster? And if he was turned, what would the four of them (since Renfield’s bound to get out of that cell even if they don’t come for him; seriously, the guy’s fantastic at that, so he’s right behind them eventually) manage to do before they were found out? Does Seward or anybody else ever notice a change in Renfield before an impromptu escape? What happens in the aftermath?

What if the Innkeeper’s Wife at the Golden Krone saw everyone on their way through Transylvania to destroy Dracula? What if everyone stopped at that hotel, since Jonathan knew it was hopefully safe? Would Jonathan try to confide in her his fears, despite the occasional language barrier? Would he—hoping she didn’t understand—even confide he was willing to follow Mina, and become a vampire if it did come to that?

Dracula (TV 1968) 

What if Dracula chose to target Jonathan to fulfill his promise after he successfully turned Lucy, instead of going after Mina by way of Lucy? Would Lucy try to tempt Seward instead, to lure him away from the cell so that Dracula could go to Jonathan? What happens if Van Helsing is there, too, and drives her off? Are they able to reach anything of his old self, to appeal to what’s left of it, or does Jonathan run into Dracula’s arms? Does he escape first, so that they can get him bitten in the privacy of the graveyard? If Lucy never revealed herself to Mina in this version, it would be nice if she still figured out the existence of vampires and tried to fight for Jonathan’s soul.

Horror of Dracula (1958) 
Jonathan Harker (Horror of Dracula 1958), Count Dracula (Horror of Dracula 1958), Arthur Holmwood (Horror of Dracula 1958), Abraham Van Helsing (Horror of Dracula 1958)

Does Dracula stay as Jonathan changes? Did Jonathan rip the room apart in a feral state, or was it just the last shred of lingering humanity that was horrified at what he had become? Or did Dracula make that mess which Van Helsing found? Did Jonathan have time to go hunting for fresh blood with Dracula before Van Helsing killed him? After a quick search around online, I see it was about 10 days for Jonathan to be a vampire. What was he like as a brand new vampire? We only see him sleeping in his coffin before he was staked. Did he actually bother to organize the books when Dracula left him alone, in between whatever else he did as a new vampire? While I’m joking about the last, I can sort of picture Jonathan trying to fix up the library.

What if Jonathan woke fully before he was staked by Van Helsing, and tried to fight back? Is there anything left of his personality to trick Van Helsing with, or is he just starving for the nearest source of blood? Or what if Jonathan traveled with Dracula, and targeted (per Dracula’s orders) Arthur while Dracula went after others? Arthur could barely handle seeing a staking of a vampire. How would he handle seeing Jonathan as one of the undead? And would he be the one forced to stake him? Or would he be bitten by him?

The Persuaders 
Brett Sinclair, Danny Wilde, Prue (The Persuaders)

I love Prue and Brett's relationship, especially the moment in 'That's Me Over There' when Brett sees her car coming and smiles smugly to himself because he knows exactly what's going to happen next. I really enjoy Prue's arch, playful way of dealing with Brett in both her episodes; it seems to me that she has the measure of him pretty well and knows exactly what she wants from him and how she plans to get it, and I'm sure it wouldn't take her too long to size up Danny in a similar way. I'm also intrigued by the possibilities of Brett and Danny interacting with a woman together when at least one of them really knows her, as that doesn't happen much on the show.

I'd really like a fic in which Brett and Prue are good friends who understand each other, and then use that understanding to run rings around Danny. I'd be equally happy with gen (casefic or just the three of them hanging out equally welcome), het or slash; I'd also love it if you went the threesome route. (My specific bunny for that is that Danny has been pestering Brett to have a threesome with him for ages, and Brett finally says 'OK, but I get to pick the woman' and asks Prue because he knows that together they'll be able to run the show. No preference as to whether this is in the context of an established Brett/Danny relationship or not.) Anything with the three of them interacting in a fun, playful way would make me happy, regardless of the pairing(s) or rating.

The Limehouse Golem (2016) 
George Flood (The Limehouse Golem (2016)), John Kildare (The Limehouse Golem (2016))

I really loved the spiky, respectful and layered relationship that the film built for these two.  How Flood looks up to Kildare and identifies with him, but at the same time really doesn't want to be where he is in twenty years, and how Kildare mentors Flood and expects the best out of him and *totally misses* all that respect and identification unless it's thrown in his face.

I'd love something that develops that relationship after the film ends.  I can absolutely see this as a potential romance, especially a slow and hesitant one.  I can equally see it as a deepening friendship (something Kildare seems terribly short of).  I would adore casefic if that's your thing.  Anything that builds on what the movie gave me with these two would make me happy.

I’ve shipped Cal/Nikko since 2003. I’m very loyal to my tiny rarepairs, what can I say.

They’re both so jealous of each other for basically the same reason, and the fact that neither of them can see that makes me want to smack their heads together. I mean the Daddy Issues, come on. 

They’re both kind of brats, but they manage to overcome that when it counts and work together, so if you felt like doing something with that dynamic I’d love it. I love the Found Family aspects of the show, too. Nikko's Two Dads, Calvin's jealousy of Nikko and Solomon's relationship, the weird sibling rivalry Nikko and Cal have going...I love all of it.

モンスター娘のいる日常 | Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou

Centorea is my favorite character in this series. I love how she maintains her sense of honor despite all the comedic hijinks, and how even though she's lost fights to various enemies she keeps on trying to battle for the people she cares about. So anything focusing on any of those aspects of her--e.g., her honor, her zeal to battle for good, her devotion to Kimihito and how her honor inspires her to fight for him--would be awesome.

Other characters from this manga I really like are Polt (the gym kobold; she's written with wonderful pep in the series, and I like the core concept of a monster having a relatively mundane job and making it awesome) and Ils Nineta (the prank-loving shrine maiden fox spirit, for similar reasons). But Centorea is my favorite, so basically anything with her, I'm happy. :-)

DC Super Hero Girls (Web Series) 
Komand'r (DC Super Hero Girls), Koriand'r (DC Super Hero Girls)

I really like the duo of Starfire and Blackfire, and have since the old Teen Titans show. In this series of course they have a much less antagonistic relationship, and I love the idea of exploring that relationship in more detail. There are so many questions to explore. A few possibilities: 

* Do they hang out together when they're both back on their home planet? 

* How would they come to each other's defense if one of them got attacked by something she couldn't handle on her own? 

* If Starfire spent a day on Korugar, how would that go differently than the day Blackfire spent on Earth? 

* Is Blackfire doing full-on supervillainy yet, and if so, how would Starfire deal with it--or if Starfire tried to do superheroics against some major monster she's not strong enough to take on, how (if at all) would Blackfire try to talk her down? 

A story exploring any of these questions (or any similar themes) would be totally awesome.

Other characters from this show I really like are the Big Barda/Lady Shiva pair (I'm a sucker for redemption arcs) and Batgirl (I'm also a sucker for non-powered heroes competing at the same level as heroes with all kinds of powers). Honestly, though, I'll like just about anything with Starfire and Blackfire in it.

As long as the story is canon-style (I’m not really into “Shelagh is a barista/astronaut/zombie/etc.”), if you have an idea of your own, or one based on one of my general likes (see my letter), I’m sure I will like it.

My main interests in this fandom are Bernadette | Shelagh &amp; Julienne, Phyllis, Phyllis &amp; Delia, Phyllis &amp; Barbara, and Delia/Patsy. I also love Sister Evangelina, although I didn’t have room to request her, so if you have a plotbunny about her, I’d be happy to read about her too. 

<i>Bernadette | Shelagh &amp; Julienne</i>
I love the mother-daughter relationship between them. It’s one of my favorite parts of the series, as Julienne watches Bernadette become Shelagh, and their relationship changes and grows over the years. When Shelagh asked Julienne to deliver her baby, and they went through her labour together, I cried, literally cried. It was so beautiful. Anything about the two of them would be wonderful. Is it hard for Julienne to watch Bernadette forsake her vows? What are her prayers for Shelagh over the years (is Shelagh’s baby an answer to them?) Does Shelagh ever miss being Bernadette, and the life she led with Julienne and the other Sisters? How did they meet for the first time? Did Bernadette or Shelagh ever comfort Julienne after a difficult day? What does Julienne miss most about Shelagh (or vice versa)?

<i>Phyllis</i>
Phyllis is probably my favourite character on the show. I love her empathy, her kindness, and her heart of gold. Anything from her POV, whether that be a character study, a day in her life at Nonnatus, her thoughts on her fellow midwives (or her patients), a glimpse into her backstory, or a canon-style midwifery case, would be wonderful. I would also enjoy a f/f romance for Phyllis with an OFC.

<i>Phyllis &amp; Delia</i>
The bit in the show where Phyllis saw Delia &amp; Patsy together and realised their secret, and then later consoled Delia with her book of poetry, really spoke to me. I would enjoy a story from Phyllis’s POV about Delia &amp; Patsy’s romance, or a story in which Phyllis and Delia talked about it (either explicitly or obliquely). I think it would be great for Delia and Patsy to have someone on their side who they didn’t have to hide their relationship from. Or I’d also love a story where Phyllis &amp; Delia became better friends (perhaps they work on a difficult case together?)

<i>Phyllis &amp; Barbara</i>
Barbara asking Phyllis to be her bridesmaid was just so lovely. It meant so much to Phyllis to be asked, and the two of them were so cute together. Like with Delia, I’d love any story with Phyllis &amp; Barbara bonding and becoming closer, whether before Tom proposed, during the wedding preparations, or after the wedding. Whether that bonding takes place during a case they share, at the clinic, or on a quiet evening at Nonnatus House, I’d enjoy it all. I’d also enjoy a futurefic in which Phyllis is Barbara’s midwife during her first pregnancy. (Though I know Barbara has no immediate plans for that!) [Oh, one note – while I don’t dislike Tom, I’d prefer his presence to be minimal, as I’m mostly interested in Phyllis &amp; Barbara.]

<i>Delia/Patsy</i>
For Delia/Patsy, I have one main request: I want them to get that flat together! They deserve a place of their own where they can be happily domestic and in love and have hot morning sex before work/drink tea together at night/argue about whose turn it is to wash the dishes/etc. Does Patsy help Delia with her midwife studies? (How might she encourage her?) Does Delia eventually become a midwife and they end up working together? (Either in general or on a specific case?) A story about a day off they spend together, whether they stay at home or go out on the town, would be lovely too.

Jackalope Wives Series - Ursula Vernon 
Grandma Harken (Jackalope Wives)

This series may just be my favourite thing I’ve read in all of 2017. Both stories are fantastic. I love Vernon’s worldbuilding, and her prose, and her fantastically rich characters (especially Grandma Harken, of course!) She’s one of my favourite authors, and the Jackalope Wives series might just be my favourite of her works. (Although it’s extremely hard to choose.)

Grandma Harken is a wonderful character, and I would adore pretty much any story about her and her adventures. There’s a history and affection between her and the Father of Rabbits – perhaps something about the two of them! (Was/is the Father of Rabbits in love with her? Were they friends? Allies?) What if the Father of Rabbits hadn’t been able to save Grandma Harken’s jackalope skin, and the jackalope wife had been stuck as a human? What might their relationship have been like? And did Grandma Harken’s first husband die a natural death, or did Grandma Harken have something to do with it? (Or the Father of Rabbits?)

I also love Spook-cat, and Eva (what’s it like to have a mother who’s a jackalope wife?), and polite Tomas with his polite mule. As for Anna, I do ship Grandma Harken/Anna, if that interests you, but I’m also interested in their friendship if you’re a gen person. All the worldbuilding about the train gods is fascinating, and I’d love to see more about that. Or about how Anna, the Mother of Trains, sees Grandma Harken, the jackalope wife. There’s a lot of respect there, mixed in with their friendship. I like how they consulted on the Marguerite problem and pooled their knowledge (over ripe tomatoes, of course).

As for the cholla-bone girl, what would it be like to have Grandma Harken as your teacher? The line about the cholla-bone girl being “more like Grandma Harken than either of them were like fully human folk” – what’s it like for the cholla-bone girl, raised among the priests of the trains, to come to Grandma Harken and find someone like her? What does Grandma Harken teach her? What sort of adventures does she have? (If the Father of Rabbits hadn’t had Grandma Harken’s skin, and the jackalope wife had stayed human and stayed with Grandma Harken, might she have fallen in love with the cholla-bone girl? What sort of life might they have forged together, preparing to take over for Grandma Harken when the desert reclaimed her?)

Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers 
Gerald Wimsey Viscount St George (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers)

I’ve always loved St George. He’s irrepressible and reckless, but he has a good heart. I find it a bit curious that his parents are Denver and Helen – he doesn’t seem to take after them much. No, who he resembles the most to me is a young male version of the Dowager Duchess! Crossed with a bit of Peter, since Peter has done his best to exert some influence on him. 

Some ideas:

- St George gets involved somehow in a murder. (Is he in the wrong place at the wrong time? Romancing a young man in another college whose roommate ends up murdered? Accused of being an accessory after evidence is found hidden in his room?) Either he tries to solve it on his own first or calls in the cavalry immediately, but the ultimate upshot is that Peter and/or Harriet and/or Bunter arrive and they work it out together.
- St George falls in love with Jones of Jesus! Who in St George’s family is the first to figure out that the ‘friend’ Jerry brought back from Oxford is a bit more than a friend? (I’d love it if Peter wasn’t the first to notice.) [As I said in my general section, please don’t have any sympathetic characters be intolerant.]
- St George being an uncle to Bredon. What kind of influence is he? What kind of things do they get up to together?
- St George and his grandmother bonding. What adventures do they have together? Does either of them have any skill at detecting? (I think the Dowager does, at any rate, given her record in Clouds of Witness with Mary's charade.)

I’ve heard that Sayers said St George died in WWII, but I, unlike Sayers, don’t have a fascination with Peter becoming Duke of Denver, and I would very much like St George to stay alive. So please don’t kill him off. I also have no interest in St George having a het relationship.

Frederica - Georgette Heyer 
Frederica Merriville, Vernon Dauntry Marquis of Alverstoke

I’m more than a little in love with Frederica. She may just be my favourite Heyer heroine (though I’d need to re-read all the books to confirm, as I like a lot of them). I adore how she’s so focused on her younger siblings, that love comes as an unlooked-for surprise. And Alverstoke! I love his character development over the course of the book – he starts as a total prick who only cares about himself and can’t even remember his nieces and nephews’ names, and then he slowly becomes more and more charmed by the Merriville family, until by the end he’s eating out of their hands. (Though he’s still a bit of a prick to other people, just not to them, which feels realistic and amuses me.) I like how his worst problem is that he’s bored and selfish, and that he falls in love not only with Frederica (though their romance is lovely), but with her entire family. 

Some of the things I’d love to read about for this book:
- Heyer books always end too abruptly! What happened after Alverstoke’s proposal? What is life like during their engagement, as Jessamy and Felix’s adventures continue to roil the household and keep it interesting, but there are more Alverstoke/Frederica stolen kisses and speaking looks? What is their honeymoon like?
- Something happens and Charis is afraid that her wedding will have to be called off! How do Frederica and Alverstoke come to the rescue?
- How do Frederica and Alverstoke help Charles and Chloë’s romance succeed? It’s not a great alliance for Chloë (unless Charles does make it big in politics), so there might be some difficulties that need to be overcome.
- Alverstoke gets in a pickle, and this time it’s the Merrivilles who have to help/rescue him. (Set anytime during the book or after.)
- Alverstoke acts like a prick to someone, and he’s a bit worried he’s going to be scolded, but it turns out Frederica doesn’t mind at all.
- - Like I mentioned in my general likes (see my letter), I’d enjoy crossovers as well. Which other Heyer heroine might Frederica fall in love with? (I’ve read and enjoyed all the Regency novels except for the Alastair-Audley series, so any of the non-AA heroines are fair game!) For crossover pairings, I am only interested in femslash.

The Grand Sophy - Georgette Heyer 
Sophy Stanton-Lacy, Charles Rivenhall

Sophy is another fantastic Heyer character. I came out of <i>The Grand Sophy</i> wanting a few specific things:

- What were Sophy’s adventures like before coming to England? How did she become the Sophy who turned the Rivenhall household upside down?
- What does Sophy see in Charles? I’m not dissing him, I just mean that we don’t get to see things from her POV. What attracts her to him? When does she start to fall in love with him? How far in advance does she lay her plans? Does she ever worry that any of her plans won’t succeed?
- I would definitely be interested in Sophy overcoming Charles’s stern-ish exterior and them having all the cuddles and horse-races and flirtatious competitions.
- In general, I would love to see more of Sophy’s POV on things! She’s quite awe-inspiring beheld from the outside, but I’d love to get inside her head more.
- Further adventures with Sophy and/or Charles!
- Like I mentioned up in my general prompts, I’d enjoy crossovers as well. Which other Heyer heroine might Sophy fall in love with? (I’ve read and enjoyed all the Regency novels except for the Alastair-Audley series, so any of the non-AA heroines are fair game!) For crossover pairings, I am only interested in femslash.

Sylvester or the Wicked Uncle - Georgette Heyer 
Phoebe Marlow

I love this book! The capers in France are a bit too drawn-out for my tastes, but apart from that I really enjoy the characters and their adventures. Edmund is a delight (child characters can sometimes be wearingly precocious, but I think Edmund is pitched just right), and Phoebe is amazing. I love her poison pen and her skill at lampooning the ton. To have a runaway bestseller on your very first try! Well done, Phoebe.

Things I would love for <i>Sylvester</i>:
- Phoebe and Sylvester’s mother Elizabeth bonding over their literary skill. (The book mentions that Elizabeth has had multiple books of poetry published herself.) What does Elizabeth think of Phoebe’s effort, beyond the portrayal of her son? Does she have any ideas about what Phoebe might try to write next? (Because I definitely don’t want Phoebe to give up her writing upon marriage.)
- What does Elizabeth think of Phoebe more generally? She was quite worried at the beginning of the book about the way her son had developed – what does she think of him now, after Phoebe’s influence has changed him? How do she and Phoebe bond after Phoebe and Sylvester’s marriage?
- Lady Constance is such an evil stepmother. She makes me boil. I would love to see how a more confident Phoebe might handle her former tormentor once engaged or married to Sylvester. Does Phoebe put her into one of her books as the primary villain? Say something cutting that only Sylvester fully understands?
- Any adventures with Edmund and Phoebe (and Sylvester if you want). I love the two of them together.
- While I do ship Phoebe/Sylvester, I found the proposal, journey, and second proposal unsatisfying. Perhaps an AU where Tom doesn’t walk in on them during the first proposal, and during the rest of the uninterrupted fight Phoebe realises that he actually loves her? (Although I don’t like the trope of ‘man forcibly kisses woman and she likes it’, so please avoid that.) Or perhaps Sylvester respects her no and doesn’t push her, and when they get back to England Phoebe sets up house with her governess and writes her next novel, and only after that does Sylvester reappear in her life. (Maybe something in her second novel makes him think his cause is not entirely lost?)
- Like I mentioned in my other Heyer sections, I would also love a crossover between <i>Sylvester</i> and one of Heyer’s other books (any of the Regency novels except the Alastair-Audley series), in which Phoebe fell in love with one of Heyer’s other heroines. Which of them would she be particularly suited to? How might they meet, and what adventures might they have?

The Bold Type 
Jacqueline Carlyle, Jane Sloan, Kat Edison, Sutton Brady

No need to include all characters, you can write about one or more as you see fit!

One of my favourite things about the series is the absence of the usual backstabbing and rivalry that often infests anything with friendships between multiple main female characters, especially if it's set in a workplace, and even more so if one of them is the boss. It's very refreshing, and honestly I can't get enough of that. I'd prefer any relationships (I love Adena too) to take second place to that, though it's absolutely welcome.

That doesn't mean it needs to be just like an episode, of course. Throw them in the deep end of something, have a disaster (or a mini-disaster) happen, let zombies invade, aliens take over, pink unicorns run rampant... crossover, dream or something more realistic, I don't mind. Just let the characters do what they would do and I'll be happy :)

These are my go-to shows for when I want to watch people being enthusiastic and/or competent. I love them all in different ways. I 've been trying to figure out which one is my favourite but it turns out the answer is aaall of them, although I may have an extra soft spot for Tales from the Green Valley because that was the first one I saw. I really couldn't choose a favourite of Alex, Peter or Ruth either, because all three of them are The Best Ever for different reasons. I love their enthusiasm and their thirst for knowledge, and the way Alex pronounces words, and Peter's fondness for pigs and Ruth making happy noises when she gets new kitchen appliances. And I love the way they squee about ancient things but never forget to point out that this doesn't necessarily mean they would want to go back and live there (especially Ruth).

Please note that I don't in any way dislike Tom or the Wartime Farm dog, I just felt it would be unfair to ask for Any and then play favourites, so to speak. If the fic of your heart is centred around Tom or the dog, with any combination of Ruth, Peter and/or Alex in the background, I would be most interested to read it! Please feel free not to include all of my requested characters here :)

Because of the way the series work, I would especially like to point out that I'm equally happy with fic about the makings of the programmes, and fic set in a historical AU where they actually work on a farm. Any era is fine (including historical eras not shown in the series), and any combination of characters - I love everyone and everything and if you want to write slash or het I'm all for it, likewise if you want to write them being really good friends, or just being enthusiastic and/or competent on their own.

In general, I like the way Cadfael and Hugh work together to get around the constraint laid on them by loyalties and such. Even better if they have to ask for help from Sister Magdalen and/or Aline because the case involves either of them. Maybe Sister Magdalen has to figure out what to do on her own? Or you could put some/all of the nominated characters in the background and write about other people in the same universe, with or without murder cases to solve.

If there's one thing I especially like about the books, it's the friendships in them. I love that they aren't just stories about murders and civil war and being divided by loyalties and young people in love, but that in the background people keep living their lives, tending their gardens and (often) trusting each other and (mostly) keeping each other's secrets. However, if you prefer to write about love and murder and loyalty and war, please go ahead!

I love this clever little show and everyone in it. I am all caught up and will be staying caught up as this season goes on, so feel free to use current canon as it develops. These two slowly and begrudgingly semi gaining respect for each other was one of my favorite things about season one, along with Eleanor's clear attraction. When she said, \"sidenote, I might legit be into Tahani,\" reader, I died and I think I might need 50k about them dealing with that and also making out in between teasing Chidi and trying to deal with being in The Bad Place. WHAT HAPPENED DURING ATTEMPT NUMBER 218? I adore the execution of this show so far, and I really love the core four and Janet, so feel free to include any and all of them as you wish.

Jules Thomas, Ophelia Mayer

This show was taken from us too fucking soon. I am so, so sad about it still. I really loved Jules and Ophelia's relationship and the development over the course of the season, and I would LOVE to have it been taken even further. Romantic or platonic, I am 100% HERE FOR IT. I also ADORE Kennedy and her relationship with Jules, and Harris and his relationship with Ophelia. I would love to see the four of them interacting if your heart so desires.

Killjoys (TV) 
Dutch (Killjoys), Aneela (Killjoys), Delle Seyah Kendry

I asked for all three of them because I HAVE SUCH A BURNING DESIRE TO SEE THEM INTERACT TOGETHER. Dutch interacting with other women in general is my favorite thing, and I've always adored her scenes with Delle Seyah, and then SURPRISE Aneela and Delle Seyah happened, and I did not think that I was going to go so hard for murder space girlfriends, but I should have known better, because that is absolutely my thing. If you are more interested in writing Aneela/Delle, that's fine, and i'm TOTALLY HAPPY to read about them and their soon to be murder baby, it's just that Dutch is my fav, and I think her relationship with Aneela is SO INTERESTING especially with the events of the season three finale!! I also ADORE Dutch and Johnny's friendship, and don't hate Ducth/D'av, and love the addition of Zeph, so, any and all combinations of that you would like to add, go wild.

Sleeping Beauty (1959) 
Aurora (Sleeping Beauty (1959))

If you're writing in this fandom, I'd love to read a story that gives us a little more insight into Aurora as a person, not just the catalyst for all the events of the movie.  In particular, I've always thought that it's SUPER WEIRD that she runs up and hugs her mother at the end of the movie, given that she'd have no clue who her mother even was.  And assuming that she marries Phillip fairly soon, she will probably never have a parent-child relationship with her actual parents -- so I think it would be interesting to know how she feels about any or all of those people, including the three good fairies.

Or write about Llewyn and the cat! Or Llewyn and Al! Slice of life fic would be nice also, how Llewyn gets by in the day to day, or anything exploring Llewyn's relationship with his art. I greatly appreciate the darkly humorous, melancholy tone of the film so would be in awe of replication of that feel.

Possession - A. S. Byatt 

Possession unites two things I love for quite different reasons: academics doing what they love, and Victorian poets. I really enjoy Byatt's intelligence and attention to detail, and the way she can make postmodern comments about literature without making you take her characters less seriously.
I'd really enjoy a story about Maud: how does her discovery work out for her? She'll have to deal with classes full of students who saw her on television once, and the other dubious rewards of academic fame.
But I'd also enjoy a story about Christabel, Randolph and/or Ellen, if that's something you'd rather write. Again, I'm curious about their later lives. How did they feel, and what did they write about, when it was all over?

Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF 

If you didn't match on this, it's worth reading about--- the Wikipedia article is pretty good. Long story short, it's that time when two teenage girls messing around with a camera convinced the world's foremost author of detective stories that there were real living fairies living in their back yard. The girls didn't actually admit to faking the pictures until the 1980s.
I'm not looking for a story about real living fairies... I've read plenty of those. I'm looking for a story about the kind of silliness that seems to embody the spirit of its age. Or, if you prefer a darker perspective, the kind of prank that's unexpectedly difficult to let go of. Feel free to write about the events of the hoax itself, or look at the girls long after their 15 minutes of fame have lapsed.

Thelma and Louise (1991) 
Louise Sawyer, Thelma Dickinson

What I most love about this movie is the discovery of self and the way the whole world looks different when someone can show you the way. I loved these two wild women letting loose. I love road stories, and the way a person's road - or travelling - self can be someone quite different to the everyday. 

I don't particularly ship them, but please do feel free to write anything from gen to one sided pining to Thelma's Lesbian Awakening to \"Thelma keeps picking up guys what is my life\". 

Prompts:
Between the worlds: I have this great wish for post-canon. Thelma and Louise: Avenging Road Ghosts. Or road tripping ghosts, the avenging's not necessary. I'd just love to see them carrying on, in their joyful way. Maybe, in a place like their canyon, the willing sacrifice of two lives in the name of freedom opens some doors. And now people see a ghost car and two laughing women, and female travelers know that if they see a green Thunderbird, any man tries to mess with them is in trouble. 

Life colliding with the new: If they had made it back to their everyday lives, what might have changed? Anything? Everything? 

Into the sunset: And if they'd made it to Mexico? Then what? 

Outside observer: In-movie, one of them reflecting on the other, or Hal's observations of them. 

General DNW: Non-con, dub-con, incest, any kind of explicit or implied sexual relationship between an adult and child or teenager - or in a mentor/student relationship, humiliation in any context (including awkward sex), infidelity, deathfic, pregnancy, kidfic, animal harm, eye injury, Trump in any form. And a cephalopod (squid, octopus) phobia, um. Although tentaclefic is fine, so long as there is no actual cephalopod, go figure.

Tell me about Rose, or anyone else you care to. Worldbuilding, if you like. 

I'm sorry this is so brief - I haven't read this in a long time, and am waiting for a copy to reread, or I would be more interesting in my prompts. I loved the world so very, very much - it has the coolest magic system I think I might ever have seen. 

What's it like to fall toward the ghostside?

And a cephalopod (squid, octopus) phobia, um. Although tentaclefic is fine, so long as there is no actual cephalopod, go figure.

The Wood Wife - Terri Windling 

This book. *This book*. I love it so much. I love that it's about an artist and her relationship and struggle with her art. I love, so much, that it's about personification of place and the magic in nature. I love that all the spirit creatures are dual-natured and might be helpful or hurtful. It is just so great, this book. You can write about anything at all, including characters not nominated, and I'll be so happy. (I'd prefer gen or non-explicit fic for this particular fandom.)

Ideas: Maggie, getting her poetry back. Does she go back to Cooper's house? Does she stay with Fox? What does her future relationship with the spirit creatures look like? I'd be really interested to read about Anna Neverra's early adventures with the mountains, if you're so inclined. (Though please note my Do Not Wants below if you tackle Anna.)  Dora: Does she start making time for her own art? What does a 'day in the life' working at the bookshop look like? I'm interested in Dora's own creative life and her friendship with Maggie. Crow: Trickster stories are the best. Anything with Crow is great.

Cass Neary Series - Elizabeth Hand 
Cass Neary

This series is very nearly perfection to me. The cheerful grimdarkness of it, the macabre and the strange, and the art, always the art. I don't - like - Cass exactly, but I do love her as a character. Her nihilism, her indestructibility, her unrelenting drive. Her cheerful amoral nature and her moments of kindness. 

So I'd like to know more about her and her world. I've read all three currently available books (Generation Loss, Available Dark, Hard Light) and would enjoy fic set it any of them, or backstory, or futurefic. 

Prompts:
Cass learning to use digital cameras - what might that change for her? Does it change what she sees? What she can or tries to capture?

Casefic! She fell into a mystery again. There are probably ghosts. 

Outside observer - maybe a stranger, maybe someone she knows. 

Dreams realised, or maybe not - Cass gets to exhibit later works, and/or put out a new book. What is the subject matter and how does it go for her?

These things don't fade away - Dealing with fallout from any of her previous adventures, particularly the supernatural kind. 

Or anything at all!

The Magnus Archives (Podcast) 
Jonathan Sims

This show! So great! I really enjoy the statements, and my favourites are the war ghosts. All time favourite is Episode 7: The Piper, all time creeped the hell out is Episode 65: Binary. The various powers and their manifestations are fascinating, and I really like the exploration of what they are, what they aren't, and how they interact with the world. The insect-based powers aren't as interesting to me as the more abstract ones. 

I've requested Jon, but if you'd like to work with other characters as well please do! I love Basira and Daisy and Melanie, I like Martin, Tim and Sasha, and am intrigued by Michael. Not terribly interested in Elias, and prefer not to focus on Not-Sasha. Gertrude is really interesting and I'd love to see her and Jon interact, somehow. 

Prompts:
I am low-key shipping Jon with Melanie King. I would love to read about them working on a case together, maybe post season two, or maybe as a side case just before. I'm a sucker for snarking between working partners, and if that leads you to shipfic that's great, but gen is just fine with me too. Maybe Jon feels the need to head overseas as well after Melanie. I'd like to see her field experience and his knowledge working together. 

Jon finds a way to talk to Gertrude. Or, more likely, Gertrude finds a way to talk to Jon. What does she know about the nature of the Archive and the role of Archivist?

What does it mean to be away from the Archive? Entities keep saying that Jon isn't protected outside the Archive - what does that mean? The title of Archivist seems to mean something to the various powers ... what?

Basira or Daisy is in trouble, and Jon is roped in to help, outside the Archive. I liked the way Jon's instant recall of a case helped Basira once before, in Police Lights, and the way that seemed to boost his confidence. I'd like to see more of that. 

Jon explains once that he \"has\" to be skeptical, but that he's always believed in the supernatural. Why? How did he end up at the Archive?

My favourite loose thread currently is the Order of the Lightless Flame - mostly because it's the only organised set of people who seem to be fighting some of the powers ... but perhaps in service to other powers? Tell me about them some more?

I have listened through to the end of season two. If season three starts in time for that to impact your story, rest assured that I will be keeping up with canon. Please feel free to either include or ignore any new material as you'd like.

All three of TWD games with Clementine have broken my heart. And the friendship that grew between Javier and Clementine in the most recent game was just really, really great to watch. I'd love anything with these two, but would particularly love something that takes place in the future, like if Clementine finds AJ and returns to Richmond where Javier has taken over as leader. Maybe he teaches them how to play baseball?

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Elliot Schafer (In Other Lands), Luke Sunborn (In Other Lands)

I didn't read <cite>Turn of the Story</cite> while it was up, but I devoured this book as soon as I realised it existed, and promptly ran to get my hands on every extra morsel available by that point. (Note: I'm 100% fine with book-only canon!) I just love Luke Sunborn and his awkward face <em>so much</em>, and I especially love how utterly wrong Elliot gets him, and how they manage to orbit each other so well throughout the years despite being completely clueless. I really enjoy how they keep catching on each other's rough edges because they can't navigate them at all.

I requested these two characters and I do love them to pieces, but if you want to include any others in the tagset (or anyone else) please feel free! This universe is endlessly fascinating to me. I would happily read any and all stories containing things like:

- Elliot being a clever little shit about absolutely anything, take your pick;
- Luke growing to fully understand and accept his half-harpy nature;
- Serene pontificating about something, Serene sharing her misandrist wisdom, Serene and Luke being swordsisters, just: Serene;
- elven society, more about how it works and how their unique little cluster might fit there (or...not);
- wings!! (I'd never realised I liked wingfic before, but hey, apparently I do);
- Woodsinger being awesome and somehow suffering all these fools (<em>how</em>);
- political shenanigans: it's brilliant to see Elliot, Luke and Serene each being awesome in their different ways to unfuck a situation, and if you want to go for plotty fic here, by all means do!

If you have any other ideas, though, please do go for it! These are just suggestions. Anything from family fic about the Sunborns being their usual overwhelming selves to a wild forest OT4 sex marathon will make me thrilled.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alma Innovator Dibars, Yaetr Innovator Dibars

I really enjoyed <cite>The Stone Sky</cite>, and one of the side stories that caught my eye was the letter exchange between Alma Innovator Dibars and Yaetr Innovator Dibars. Yaetr \"discovered\" that orogenes' intervention prevented several seasons in the past, and Alma put an end to that research for political reasons. I couldn't help put wonder what kind of story lurked behind those brief notes.

How did Yaetr start researching roggas? Why look into this, specifically, when the Fulcrum certainly wouldn't have wanted anyone coming anywhere near these conclusions? Was Yaetr at all empathetic or just interested in predicting future Seasons? What was the research process like? What was the relationship between Alma and Yaetr like, and what did it turn into after that event? How did Yaetr take the silencing, what did they do after? What was the environment at the Seventh in Dibars like, did Yaetr and Alma ever overlap there with Tonkee, or with Alabaster or Syenite being used for research?

The way that <cite>The Broken Earth</cite> interweaves questions of oppression, identity and violence with every level and angle of worldbuilding is so well thought-out and executed. It would be interesting to catch another glimpse of this side of events: the many ways that a fact so glaringly obvious and important to keeping everyone alive gets suppressed and ignored to benefit the dominant narrative.

Love for the Cold-Blooded - Alex Gabriel 
Serpentissima (Love for the Cold-Blooded), Tom | Serpent Slut (Love for the Cold-Blooded)

This story was so fun, and I am <em>so here</em> for wacky supervillain family dynamics! They seemed to genuinely care about each other so much, regardless of the fact that they they express affection in somewhat unconventional ways sometimes. I would so happily read more about that in all kinds of ways.

Does Serpentissima try to take over the world again? What's that like for the rest of the family? What about when Hell starts growing into her own independent challenger self and tries her own first major nefarious plot, how do her parents help and/or accidentally thwart her efforts? Or: what's it like for them to have a hoagie in the family? Just how awkward do Christmas dinners get? Or: what's it like for Serpentissima and Tom to have grandchildren? I'd also love to see a flashback to Serpentissima's first ascent and why it failed, or how she ended up falling for Tom in the first place.

Basically, I'd be happy with any story dealing with the unique peculiarities of the West family. Please feel free to include Helena, Boadicea, Zenobia, Patrick and Nick if you wish, as well as any other challengers or superheroes you want!

Peer Gynt - Henrik Ibsen 
Solveig (Peer Gynt)

Solveig has always fascinated me, and we get so little of her in the play, I’d love to see her fleshed out. What made her stay her entire life and wait for Peer? How did she manage in the forest all alone? Or what if she hadn’t? What if she’d gone back to the village? What if she’d followed Peer on his adventures? How would they have turned out differently? Or what if he hadn’t left? What if he hadn’t gone off with Ingrid from Hægstad? Or what if he hadn’t run away when the Greenclad came? Or what if he’d still left, and Solveig was left with the Greenclad’s child? There are so many possibilities!
In general, I like most things. I am a multishipper, and I read slash, het, femslash, and gen. Femslash and gen are especially welcome, as they tend to be underrepresented categories!

I don’t mind non-prompted characters being included.
Tropes that I particularly enjoy are found families, hurt/comfort, POV outsider, canon divergence, characters with low self-worth being loved and accepted, time travel, happy poly relationships, happy asexual characters and relationships, competent characters being awesome, women being super awesome, women supporting other women, 5+1, and crossovers.
I don’t really enjoy PWP – in fact, I prefer any sex scenes to be of the fade to black variety, or referred to, rather than described, if included at all. I also don’t like incest, teacher/student, mpreg or a/b/o, even as romantic tropes. Characters being accused of something they didn’t do tends to make me anxious, so please avoid that if possible. I also don’t like to read about infidelity or about protagonists doing things they know will hurt other protagonists, or about jealousy/love triangles (poly relationships! healthy communication!). Please no character bashing: unless the character is a villain in canon, please write them sympathetically, or leave them out.
This all being said, am not that picky and will enjoy most things if they’re well written enough, if none of my preferred prompts grab your imagination. I’m sure I’ll love whatever you write!

Hidden Figures (2016) 

I loved this film, and think it’s a travesty there’s not more fic for it! Fic celebrating the absolutely fantastic relationship (femslash or gen) between Katherine, Dorothy and Mary, or the ladies being absolutely awesome and kickass the way they were in the movie, or family feels with Katherine and Jim, or what it's like working at NASA, what happens after the film, or anything you like to write is more than welcome!

I like reading about the Circle, and their closeness. I also have a fondness for Tris at Lightsbridge stories, trying to hide who and what she is. I prefer relationships within the Circle and with their teachers and students to be platonic/familial, but am happy to read about them paired with outside characters (canon or OCs). I generally prefer Emelan stories to be set in something approaching the canon world (i.e. medievalist fantasy-like settings), but I’m not averse to broadening my horizons if you really feel the itch to write a completely different world.

League of Legends RPF 

1. I know the Rox Tigers going their separate ways has been written about ad nauseam but I would love a take on it where it isn't actually a terrible thing for everyone, and they figure out how to maintain their friendships with new distance and new loyalties. 

2. Various SKT things I am enthusiastic about: Faker and Huni actually going to Hong Kong, SKT newbies fighting for Faker's attention and affection, Bengi coming back to \"coach\" or work for SKT and how that affects Faker, how Peanut learns to fit into his new team, boys being overly competitive about forced team bonding sports...

3. Regardless of how the season ended I still feel so #/blessed to have had two of my favorites on the same team together. Even from the start they seemed to get along really well and they're both such positive people. I'd love anything about them getting closer as friends or more than friends, especially if it touches on how cuddly Kuro is. Or, just Afreeca as a whole becoming what looked to be like a really friendly and caring team.

4. Literally anything about how much Doublelift thinks Biofrost hung the moon.

David really came into his own at the end of season three, and his relationship to and with his family is another thing I'd enjoy seeing explored, especially in the context of his new business and new partner.

My longing for more of this show has not yet faded. Whitechapel ended just when things were getting <em>really interesting</em>, the relationship between Chandler and Kent being just one of those things. Whether you read it as a crush on Kent's part, a potential relationship for both, or a hero worship/mentor situation, I want to see what happens next. It's not necessary to jump in right where the show left off (though there's a lot of potential there); any time in the future is good. I do ship them, but not to the exclusion of all other possibilities if you don't. And if you <em>do</em>, explicit is more than welcome. Casefic, and casefic mixed with relationship building, are both also excellent. Really, I just want my boys back again.

The Expanse (TV) 
Chrisjen Avasarala (The Expanse (TV)), Bobbie Draper (The Expanse (TV))

I'd love to see some canon divergence or canon speculation about Bobbie and Chrisjen and their relationship development as allies from very different worlds.

I wouldn't mind seeing Chrisjen introducing Bobbie to Earth culture - after seeing Bobbie's delighted reaction to cucumber sandwich hors d'oeuvres and considering my impression of Martian food culture as somewhat ascetic, I kept imagining Chrisjen inviting Bobbie to dinner with her family and introducing Bobbie to an diverse array of Indian food, or some other \"Earther delicacy\".

Alternately, Bobbie introduces Chrisjen to some Martian practice, food, or cultural norm, something that Chrisjen thinks she understands as a life-long diplomat and student of politics, but she finds herself understanding it in a totally new way after learning about it from Bobbie.

I'd be intrigued to see a romantic dalliance between these two, as long as Chrisjen's husband Arjun isn't implied to be a bad person - their relationship is so strong and lovely - but maybe it's an open relationship, or it's an AU where Arjun has died. Bobbie seems to be under the impression that Chrisjen is a fragile little old lady, and though she's been disabused of that notion to some extent now, probably, it would be interesting to see her learn it more intimately!

Fandom-specific DNWs: Though it's unlikely he'd come up, I don't want to read about Joe Miller, please. Other characters appearing, especially Arjun or Cotyar or the Roci crew, are fine

General DNWs:A/B/O dynamics (Werewolves are great, but the A/B/O trope doesn't work for me), mpreg, bestiality, excessive focus on bodily fluids/bodily fluid-focused kinks, age regression in romantic pairing fics (I'm OK with it for platonic pairings!), high school AUs, childhood friends-to-lovers (unless canonical), teacher/student relationships (even when the student is adult)

John Wick (John Wick), Gianna D'Antonio (John Wick)

I would be very pleased to receive straight-up worldbuilding in this setting - please feel free to barely mention either requested character and tell me a story about how you perceive the details of the world. An outsider's POV would be fascinating - either a true outsider to the setting, or someone who works for the Assassins but isn't actually one, perhaps. How did they perceive the events of either film, especially Gianna and/or Santino's deaths and what it means for the future that John flouted the rules so explicitly? How did they perceive - and how do they talk about - the events of John's Task that allowed him to leave their world years ago?

I would also love fic that explores the past that John and Gianna are strongly implied to share. Were they lovers? What was that like? Their hands are metaphorically - and sometimes literally - dripping with blood, the both of them, and while the John of the films seems to be ambivalent about aspects of his past, Gianna seems to be totally unashamed. Has it always been that way?

Alternately, an entirely morbid canon divergence fic in which Gianna requests (demands? draws on old promises to compel?) a final fling with John \"for old time's sake\" before he kills her could be both highly creepy and very hot - dubcon and/or femdom themes welcome. Could still end with Gianna's death or be ambiguous or go entirely AU somehow...

The Vikings (1958) 
Eric (The Vikings 1958), Einar (The Vikings 1958)

Eric and Einar's relationship is such an incredible mix of loathing and jealousy and admiration - you can cut the tension with a knife in their scenes. I would love to see any kind of exploration of their rivalry and what precipitated it - one may be the Jarl's son, and the other a slave, but they grew up together, after all. Would be happy to see Kitala and/or Sandpiper show up in a pre-canon fic like this - how did they become so close to Eric?

I could also see a canon divergence in which Einar does not die, but the two of them remain rivals and warleaders constantly struggling for power - what might that look like? Does Morgana remain a point of contention between them? Does Eric's knowledge of Viking culture make him more successful and fending off Einar's attacks?

I'm absolutely here for a sexual relationship between the two - consensual but heavy on the competitive rivalry, dub-con, or non-con all welcome, either pre-canon, at any point during the film, or canon divergence. One specific point of divergence that might work well is when Einar attempts to rape Morgana, he's put off by her total passivity and lack of response to his urging to fight him - perhaps he goes looking for Eric with the assumption that Eric will fight back.
Fandom-specific DNW: I would prefer no Modern AUs in this fandom. Also, I'm fine with seeing the characters interact as children or teens, but if there's any sexual content, please age the characters at least to \"ambigously late teens\" at minimum.

Wonder Woman: Warbringer - Leigh Bardugo 
Alia Keralis, Diana (Wonder Woman: Warbringer), Theo Santos, Poornima \"Nim\" Chaudhary

I adored this book and would love any story from this universe. Post-canon/future fic would be amazing! I know we likely caught a glimpse of the future at the end of the book, but there's so much that will happen between that vision and where the book ends, and it would be wonderful to see all four of these characters growing into those people. OR if you have an idea for what that future adventure entails, that would also be excellent!

Wonder Woman (2017) 
The Amazons (Wonder Woman 2017)

Hey, so, I cry through this entire movie beginning with the scene where the Amazons are training, so, I have a lot of just general Amazons feelings and would be super here for literally anything about life on the island? I loved all the Amazon characters in the tag set but I settled with just tagging \"Amazons\" in my signup because I would love a story about any or all of them. Like, tell me about law and politics on Themiscyra and give those Senators the backstory they deserve, write the epic love story of Menalippe and Antiope, the comedy and drama of Diana's revolving door of tutors, a day in the life of Philippus who is clearly the smartest Amazon and knew if they killed Steve Trevor immediately they wouldn't learn anything, Clio's process (ahem) of writing her lengthy treatise on bodily pleasure, the trials and tribulations of Epione as she tries to be the healer for an island of warriors,  Diana's secret training sessions with Antiope.... Literally, dear author, you could write a story about the curator of what is essentially the Amazon museum and fancy weapons emporium and how upset she was to discover Diana had made a bunch of holes in the exterior wall and made off with weapons and armor and I would be delighted. IT'S AN ISLAND OF WOMEN, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

The Proposal (2009)

This movie essentially is just a showcase of so many of my favorite tropes-- sharing a bed, pretending to be in a relationship/falling for each other as a result, cuddling for warmth-- so basically go wild with tropey stuff if you feel like it. Post-movie dating fic would be great, like, obviously they have feelings for each other but how is Margaret handling being a hardass professional editor and also a human being with emotions she lets other people see (even if the other people are just Andrew?)? Is Andrew an editor now? Does that make them rivals professionally? How's that working out (could be hot! could be hilarious! could be both!)?

Shinreigari GHOST HOUND 
Komori Tarou, Oogami Makoto

Request: I'm here for anything about these two and their fraught relationship! Another kidnap and rescue, if you like high drama, would be awesome. I'd love to get into interpersonal relationship drama, if they are openly struggling to be friends despite the difficulty between the branches of the family-- or more than friends if you're inclined to explore the ways they are broken-but-together. On a different note from teens struggling with their senses of self, I would be interested to see the future where they both try to fulfill their places in the family businesses- Makoto as the fortune teller and Taro making truly mind-altering sake, or having traded family trades. If you're into writing poetical things, it would be wonderful to see Taro help Makoto try to turn their hauntings into a song, or getting together with Makoto to make or use gadgets to catch supernatural sounds for sampling in Makoto's music. Nightmares, or being trapped together, or some outside force pushing them to work together through their feelings of connectedness and forced separation- the scarier and more vulnerable for them, the better! I' excited for gen fic as well as ship fic for these unhealthy cousins. I am a sucker for anything resembling a bully-to-protector redemption arc. I love how much tension and distance there is between Taro and Makoto at the beginning of the show, and the underlying current of affection and concern that they have for each other - a mutual desire to protect the other from harm (including the potential harm of dealing with each other, early on). I love them as awkward friends or distant relatives as much as I love them as bonded or brotherly, and anything about their difficult progress together will make me happy. I should probably note that when I say \"bully to protector\", I don't mean to imply that Makoto is necessarily always the bully or the protector in any of these situations, and I'd love a fic about his feelings (including those of resentment) with regards to Taro and their connections or shared experiences, for example.

Yes, Please: body horror, darkfic, established or developing relationships, angst, trauma and dissociation

Frozen Teardrop (Light Novels) 

Request: I know these light novels are much loathed by a lot of the fandom, but I really enjoyed some of the character building details and the glimpse of the Mars Century the characters were dreaming of in their After Colony days. I love Kathy, and her no-nonsense attitude despite the fact that she is a Gundam novel protagonist doomed to deal with a lot of nonsense from the new generation and old fogeys alike. I'd love to see more of her thoughts on the other nominated characters and how the legend of who they were was built up, not just by her mom in fond recollection, by the society their interventions created. Chang's long-term management in the Preventers sticks out as one of the few consistencies in the lives of the pilots postwar experiences-- sure enough, he gets the job done through persistence and has a lasting effect unlike any other. All of these poor fools at the end of the epilogue having to deal with Father Maxwell becoming President Maxwell would also make for a great adventure-- maybe involving Mars' new high speed railways? Maybe a smuggling case involving Instructor W's work as a disavowed-and-disowned castoff of the Winner corporation sees new suits or full-body/spinal column mech integration plans for the Zero System's next next next gen fall into dangerous hands, or former debtors are leaning on Maxwell for a sweet business deal? Kathy as interpersonal investigator of the wreckage of these friendships, or Chang's Girl Friday, or the spitting image of Sally not taking any of Maxwell's shit or W's sweetness would warm my little heart.

Yes Please: casefic, stories in the form of news or reports, on-the-job-training, office comedy, hard sci-fi setting treated as utterly mundane, Kathy matchmaking, character studies, found family.

Mihashi Ren, Haruna Motoki

Request: I've been re-reading lately and thinking fondly of Mihashi and Haruna having their pitching genius bonding session while Abe and Akimaru sort of sulked and watched the pitchers grope each other. My simple desires are for Mihashi to have a friend who appreciates his strength and stamina despite being definitively better and encouraging him to go pro, and for Haruna to have a kouhai or friend who isn't terrified of him or tired of his shit, who can give him a chance to shine as a teacher and motivator. I feel like their dynamic could take many roads to infuriatingly good friendship, or build a future dynamic between them as a pro starter and relief team, and want to read all the possibilities your heart (or theirs) might contain. I love that these baseball nuts have fun together, despite how different they seem. Do they come up with a scheme during Haruna's draft season? Could they be secret training buddies? I'd love to see Haruna preening at the chance to show off his knowledge, dedication and prowess, and Mihashi's diligence and hunger for pitching power and speed getting them both fired up.

Yes, Please: nonverbal communication, rivals-to-friends and friends-to-rivals, secret relationship tropes, buddy comedy, road trip or shopping trip hijinx, montage or vignettes of developing relationships, after hours at the batting cages, hero worship, body worship, bullying as bonding, story in the form of text logs/modern epistolary

神撃のバハムート | Shingeki no Bahamut | Rage of Bahamut (Anime) 
Nina Drango, Favaro Leone

Request: Thirsty Redheads: Apprentice and Mentor Edition! That is to say, I loved the episode focused on Nina and Favaro's brief training time together, and greatly enjoy their dynamic and the way she mirrors a lot of his traits from Genesis. Missing scenes from their time as \"Master\" and \"apprentice\", or scenes from the present-day of the canon of their adventurous hijinks fomenting civil unrest in the capitol would lend to the sort of swashbuckling action the show does so well. I'd be interested in a postcanon take on their feelings around Amira and Charioce, or Bahamut and Chris. Favaro meeting Nina's totally epic grandma and trading a tall tale for some secret power or object (or the company of the right beauty, knowing that guy) would make for a fun re-telling by Nina to the gang over drinks. Precious dragon girl and her sneakthief teacher/big brother/dirty uncle lying through their teeth badly and still managing to get away from some high class banquet with a whole roast pig and a bandolier of turkey legs sounds about perfect. If you want to go the sex-comedy route, Nina trying to get advice about her first time from this asshole Favaro would be great. EDITED TO ADD-- now that the series is over, I can also say that I loved the ending, so if you want to jump off of the canon into future adventures, I would love to see how they go!

Yes, Please: buddy comedy, slapstick, lying badly, lying brilliantly, unreliable narrators, tall tales or campfire stories, found family, unwise advice, cast cameos and background pairings (especially Rita/Kaisar, or Rita/Kaisar/Favaro)

Peter Darling - Austin Chant 

I love how this book plays with the idea of Neverland being real and unreal, and the concept of growing up and facing reality--how you need to do it eventually, but there are some things that you believe you can only achieve in your dreams, how you run away from the real world out of pain or fear. Also loved the characters, obviously! Peter/James and Peter/Ernest both strike me as very good ships, and Tink's loyalty to Peter as well as her background friendship with Hook are very interesting. A fic that plays with the reality/make believe and coming of age themes would be particularly interesting to me.

Nick Carraway (Great Gatsby - Fitzgerald), Jay Gatsby (Great Gatsby - Fitzgerald)

I definitely believe Nick is either gay or bi--in any case, not straight. Nick/Gatsby fic would be fun. I do think Nick certainly has a crush on him in canon. But I'd also be interested to see fics about them separate of their relationship if that's your thing, especially Nick, who feels both isolated from the world of New York and intrigued by it. Of course a lot of Nick's personality in The Great Gatsby is shown in relation to Gatsby and vice versa, so perhaps they do better together after all.
DNW: PWP. In this fandom I don't actually mind major character death since it's canon, but I'd still prefer to see Gatsby live if possible.

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

Look, I'm going to be honest with you here: I went to Dunkirk for Harry Styles. I mean, I would have seen it anyway, because I'm a WWII buff, but fundamentally, Harry Styles. I was not expecting to end up with a massive Jack Lowden crush along the way. But here we are.

I would love any kind of story dealing with the relationship between Collins and Farrier. I totally slash them, but if you don't, feel free to stick with a brotherly dynamic. I'd like something centered around the War (pre-, during, or immediately post), no present-day AUs. However, I'd be utterly tickled by a wartime AU where same-sex love was totally normal and accepted, maybe even honored in the military (where a wingman can be like a shieldmate). Not a necessity, but feel free to go that way if that tickles your fancy as well.

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* Something when they first meet when Collins joins the squadron before the war starts. Maybe they're a little prickly at first, being very different personalities and backgrounds, but they can't seem to stop dancing around each other. Eventually they realize they're both men for men and one of them decides to court the other amid the chaos of the oncoming war.
* Farrier escapes the enemy and makes his way back home, maybe in time to fight with Collins in the Battle of Britain, or maybe arriving just after and fearing what he'll find. 
* Either before Dunkirk or later in the war, one of them gets shot down and the other is sure that they didn't make it (but of course they did)
* A series of times they flew together, on patrol or in battle. 

DNW: no death, please! Assumed death for the sake of angst is just fine, as long as it has the comfort payoff. And please no pairing them with other people, whether or not you write them as lovers.

Dunkirk-specific likes: I adore dogfight scenes where you can feel the adrenaline rush. Out of all the various first names I've seen for Collins in fic, my favorite is Ainsley (no preference for Farrier's). I'd be happy to see any of the other Dunkirk characters around as secondary characters, as long as there's a logical reason for them to be there. For the record, I also adore Tommy/Alex as a pairing, so if for whatever reason the Collins/Farrier isn't floating your boat, I would also be perfectly happy with a Tommy/Alex story (not that the two of them have a great record with floating boats).

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 
Ralph Lanyon, Laurie Odell

When I got obsessed with Dunkirk, I remembered that one of my old favorite Mary Renault books was actually set right after Dunkirk. So I decided to re-read it and tumbled right back down the rabbit hole, harder than ever. I am completely obsessed and fascinated with Ralph and Laurie as individual characters and as a couple. 

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* An AU where Ralph doesn't start anything with Hazell. He and Laurie become closer while still at school and become lovers long before Dunkirk.
* Anything set soon after the end of the book as they try to get their relationship on solid ground amid the chaos of war.
* Something exploring Ralph's POV at the end of the book. How did he end up so close to suicide? What did he feel when he walked into his flat and saw Laurie there? The final words of the book imply that they were able to finally stop fighting all the things driving them and rest together - but how did that look, the rest of that night? (alternatively: Alec's POV as he figures out what's going on, sends Laurie to Ralph, and then waits to discover the outcome)
* Or Ralph's POV during the infamous party scene - how he felt when he first saw Laurie alive and well, all the pushes and pulls he must have felt during those hours, dealing with everything going on at the party, longing for Laurie but still so unsure of him, trying to get his own head together while also managing everyone else.

DNW: no death, no infidelity, no Andrew (unless it's a scene of him meeting the real Ralph, but please no lingering romantic feelings to/from Laurie). Beyond the level of the books, no feckless or submissive Laurie or domineering or condescending Ralph.

Charioteer-specific likes: I love Laurie and Ralph as equal partners, each bringing their own strengths to the relationship. I love Laurie learning to take care of Ralph as much as Ralph takes care of him, and Ralph learning to allow and enjoy it. I love Laurie learning how he wants to define himself as a queer man and figuring out how he fits into that world on his own terms. I really like Alec as a side character, and I'm fond of Sandy as well (if you include him, please don't treat him poorly! he's capable of growth, too!). I also wouldn't mind Bunny popping back into the scene, if you think of something interesting to do with him - particularly interacting with a Laurie more confident in himself and Ralph's love. I also love outsider POVs on their relationship.

Lethal Weapon (TV) 
Trish Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Roger Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Brooks Avery (Lethal Weapon (TV))

This is my little stealth fandom that no one else seems to love! I adore this show and all the characters and their relationships. The Riggs/Murtaugh relationship is the absolute perfect slashy bromance -- I'd love a story focusing on that relationship whether it's platonic bros or bickering lovers. Either way, though, Trish needs to be fully aware and involved, because I love her and her relationship with Roger. I guess what I really want is to see Riggs getting semi-reluctantly absorbed into the Murtaugh family. I also tagged Captain Avery here because he is so long-sufferingly awesome and I would be so happy if he were involved as a major character dealing with his brilliant asshole cops. 

Some prompts for your inspirational convenience:
* Riggs and Murtaugh trying to cope with their first family Christmas, possibly including some criminal hijinx that keep pulling them away from the eggnog
* Murtaugh has a near-death experience (another heart attack, shot, whatever) and gets to talk to Miranda Riggs before he's brought back 
* One of them gets kidnapped and the other works with Captain Avery to rescue him in time.

DNW: no death (real death, assumed death for the sake of angst is A-okay!), no infidelity (polyamory in any configuration is also A-okay!)

LW-specific likes: show-level banter, all the side characters (but maybe less of Jordana Brewster as the Worst Psychologist Ever, unless it's for amusing therapy sessions which would be awesome), the awesomeness of the Murtaugh family, those moments when Murtaugh proves he's just as crazy as Riggs, outsider POVs on their relationship

I really love both characters. They're both broken in such complementary ways, and I enjoy seeing that contrast between them. I also really like when writers deal with how having a homosexual relationship in the 80s was very different from having one now. I'm up for anything with them, with a particular fondness for getting together/having a secret relationship and the fallout of that/what they do when they graduate.

Keith's muppet face. I enjoy the Try Guys because they're so nonstereotypicaly masculine and endlessly comfortable with the sheer number of times they've seen each other naked for the camera. I want so, so badly for the story of how Eugene and Keith hooked up during the filming of testing the legal blood alcohol limit, but am also up for anything else involving them. They both have such great senses of humor, and I'd like to see that translated. Or, alternatively, filming the apocalypse. Because what else are they going to do?

Liar! Uncover the Truth (Visual Novel) 
Main Character (Liar!), Katagiri Keima (Liar!), Mamiya Haruichi (Liar!)

I requested the MC along with two of my favorite guys, even if they're both liars.   Keima because his lover ending stands out as the only one where the guy works his ass off to fix his faults and become worthy of the MC's affections instead of just sorta hovering around pestering her until she decides they're too pathetic to not hear out, Haruichi because even if you don't purchase his complete route he's the only one who across all of his endings (except the bad end, which just feels out of character compared to the rest) is obviously really in love with the MC. Also, his lie is a pretty sexy one.  I'd like shippy fic with one of the guys or the other, but you don't need to have the the other show up!

I also really enjoy how the game makes it clear that the MC is not the greatest prize herself, while she's pretty and fun she's also terrible at being an adult and too judgmental (with the two guys here it's very obvious in Haruichi's route, where she's constantly having unkind thoughts about poor Ayumi even though the poor kid's obviously super on her side). The only thing I ask when it comes to picking a name for her is that you go with one that's Japanese.

Soooo, I totally went into this game expecting Joseph to be the guy I would totally hate only to end up on the \"Oh my god, give these poor guys a happy ending! He can dump my character while he works through things, that's fine, but that marriage needs to end!\" side.  So, yes, always more fix-it fic please! And, like I said, I would totally count it as being fix-it if the two guys don't end up together but their time together it just the push Joseph needs to get out of that marriage.

One thing I will say is that I prefer you not run with the word of god that Joseph was comfortably bi all along. He doesn't need to angst over being gay, but if he's not at least firmly in the closet to 99.9% of the world the lack of a good ending just feels even more annoying.

Ha, I totally didn't plan to request this again when I just got a wonderful story for the pairing in Press Start, but then I saw that *someone else* had nominated Ignatius and went \"Well, okay, this is clearly a sign.\"

You know, the only reason I ever got this ending was because I wanted to get the achievement for getting him to divorce then figured I might as well go for the match, because otherwise I would never be willing to toss Julianna in jail and not release her. So I was honestly surprised when I got it and it turned out to be one of my very favorites. I really like how we know from WoG that the reason he abstains at the vote of no confidence is because he's grateful to her for his position but thinks that she's completely mad for treating his sister the way she did, and it takes you literally making her the very best Elodie she can be to make him see her as someone he could love, and even then she really has to work for it to make him consider marrying someone so young showing that she must genuinely want to be with him to bother. And, honestly, it just makes me happy for the poor guy to finally have someone who really wants him.

I do ship future Sasha/Raz, but absolutely do not feel like you need to work that in if it squicks you.

I'd love some mission fic. You don't even need to go deeply into what the mission itself is, I'd just be really interested in seeing how the brain-diving we do in-game translates to using it against villains who are actively fighting them instead of people who area generally okay with them being in there. Future summers at camp would be fun too! I always see Raz as continuing to go even when he's too old for it, because he's still too young to be recognized as a real Psychonaut and they're the only ones who treat him like he is one anyway. Maybe he starts acting as a counselor himself?

There's something about the tone of this film that I absolutely love - how absurd it is and yet how Adele takes everything in stride so matter of factly. I love the two sisters and their relationship and how Adele portrays it and how it actually was and how she does love her sister. I love Adele and her penchant for ridiculoaus disguises. To be honest, I'd love to see anything set in this world but particular favourites of mine are the sisterly relationship, Adele going after what she wants with utter determination, and the blending of the historical time period with fantastical elements. Also, Patmosis and the mummies remain hilarious to me.

I would enjoy gen fic quite a bit, so no need to worry about pairing, but for info's sake, pairings I love: Luke/Jessica, Matt/Foggy, pairings I don't mind: Matt/Jess, Claire/Luke, Jess/Trish. Not a big fan of anything else, sorry!

The Raven and the Reindeer - T. Kingfisher 
Gerta (The Raven and the Reindeer), Janna (The Raven and the Reindeer), Mousebones (The Raven and the Reindeer)

Very simply i want to know What Happened After. A bit of Janna backstory would be lovely too. But what are the pitfalls and discoveries on the way to the HEA? Alternatively, what is the next ig adventure? Do they set off to fight an unfriendly giant, find more royalty to unseat, adopt a cat?

Frequency (2000) 
Frank Sullivan (Frequency (2000)), John Sullivan (Frequency (2000))

I've provided prompts, but feel free to deviate, and please, please, please, don't confuse number of prompts, their degree of detail, or apparent enthusiasm for having favorites that I want more than the others. Everything is here because it's something I want.  General likes and fandom details in the letter.

DO NOT WANTS
* A/B/O, soul-bonding, love potions, etc. (basically, no supernatural/mystical/magical relationship dynamic)

* Non-canon established relationships

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS: Two lines prompt three scenarios for me.
1. \"She just died? Your mother just died?\" \"No, Dad. It happened a long time ago for me.\"

After this exchange, Frank considers a future without Julia and what it would be like to raise John by himself.

Lop off the last half of that conversation, and give me a story where Julia really DID just die in the future and Frank has to talk a devastated John through it.

2. \"Time to die, soldier,\"
(Said on John's end, heard on Frank's)

Frank's forgotten a lot of things in his lifetime, but he's carried those four words in his head for 30 years. Show me Old Man Frank Sullivan, waiting for the day he knows is coming. The day the man who tried to kill his wife will try to kill his son.

Journeyman 

I've provided prompts, but feel free to deviate, and please, please, please, don't confuse number of prompts, their degree of detail, or apparent enthusiasm for having favorites that I want more than the others. Everything is here because it's something I want.   General likes and specific fandom details in the letter.

DO NOT WANTS
* A/B/O, soul-bonding, love potions, etc. (basically, no supernatural/mystical/magical relationship dynamic)

* Non-canon established relationships

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS:  I just want more. It can be case-fic. It can be fluffy. It can be gen or shipfic or just about anything in between. One idea I was kind of wrangling with was for Jack and Theresa to be getting married but their wedding day is made all the more chaotic by Dan's journeys as they all have to add covering for him to their duties. And maybe something about what Dan's doing in the past disrupts Jack and Theresa in the future and he has to fix it? Or maybe Dan's journeys to the past help Jack solve a case in the present (and get Dan a big story for the paper). Or Katie and Theresa talk about life with Vasser men or about life in general, IDK. Or Katie has to go out of town for a week and since Zack can't miss that much school and Dan's erratic time-traveling isn't good for single parenting, they stay with Jack and hijinks ensue. Just, more Journeyman for everyone and no breaking up of Katie/Dan.

The Pretender (TV) 
Jarod (The Pretender)

I've provided prompts, but feel free to deviate, and please, please, please, don't confuse number of prompts, their degree of detail, or apparent enthusiasm for having favorites that I want more than the others. Everything is here because it's something I want.   General likes in the letter.

* A/B/O, soul-bonding, love potions, etc. (basically, no supernatural/mystical/magical relationship dynamic)

* Non-canon established relationships

* Sexual violence or humiliation

* Alternate-setting AUs

* Age-gap romance (especially between characters with a parent/child, mentor/mentee relationship)

* PWP

* Incest

* 2nd-person/reader fic

PROMPTS: Prompt 1: Jarod finds himself in a cuddling group and ends up getting all the affection he missed out on at The Centre. Please stay fluffy and nonsexual.

Prompt 2 : Jarod is taking a break from cases while pretending to be a teacher at a boarding school when a death starts to look like more than an accident. Or maybe there really is no case there and he just uses his experience to be a good mentor to a bunch of kids.

CRACK PROMPT CROSSOVER ALERT: Jarod has another younger brother -- immediately put up for adoption to keep him safe from The Centre. His name: Phil Dunphy, and when Jarod  finds him, he gains the biggest modern family he's ever known. I'd be happy with this set any time from present day to pre-series for Modern Family and as fluff or more serious with Miss Parker, Sidney and Broots catching up to them and discovering Phil (and Haley, Alex or Luke if it's set late enough). Basically, I just really want Phil to be a long lost Jarod brother, and would be happy with pretty much any circumstance. My research has Jarod born around 1960 and Phil around 1969. Feel free to play around with time/ages if you want more current Modern Family but early-series Pretender. I don't necessarily need Jarod to be pushing 60 when he finds Phil. Also feel free to ignore the Pretender movies and, really, a lot of the late-series conspiracy stuff.

* PWP

* Incest

PROMPT:  Let's face it: For the most part, Dewey always looked like kind of a doof. But what if he were actually really good at his job, and nobody really noticed because of his doofy exterior? Show me Dewey figuring things out or otherwise being a good deputy (or generally being competent in his other roles, if set during or after a sequel). He doesn't have to be THE HERO or come through it unscathed if you go the trick route. He may even be too late to be any help, but just give me some acknowledgment that he's a trained professional in law enforcement.
