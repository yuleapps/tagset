## Stack

Before you start, you'll want to know how to use the following

* Firebase.io: real-time database and hosting
* Vue.js: frontend framework and dev server
  * For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

To get firebase working on your local dev server, you'll need the API keys in `src/config.js`: email an admin for that file. We r super sekure right now.
