It is one of my favourite movies - I love Jimmy Stewart particularly and it is such a witty script.  I am a slash fan so in an ideal world I would like some CK Dexter Haven/Macauley Connor, but to be honest, I do feel Tracey is who they revolve around so a lovely threesome relationship fic would fit brilliantly in my personal head-canon.  In particular, I think that Dex and Tracey will only repeat past mistakes unless there is something different in the mix - and that is probably Mac!  However, I do like angst as well as happy fic, so you could go down a messier path with these three if you would prefer.\n\n\n"

Not that I would mind something fluffy where they are already in an established or almost established relationship. I love the idea of them happily horseback riding across the beach, joking and laughing and the romance being an extension of their friendship.\n\nSome more hurt/comfort after Francis’ failed suicide attempt would be very welcome. Perhaps they get drunk and there is a heart-to-heart conversation which ends in kissing. (After all, Francis is known to make bad or at least impulsive choices while drunk. Dwight has also made questionable decisions when it comes to sex and love affairs, so I do not think this is too terribly farfetched.) Another mildly AU scenario I would love to see is where Francis makes a repeat suicide attempt (or perhaps his initial one did not involve a gun, or however you want to make it work). He botches that one too, but gets hurt in the process this time. Dwight saves him just in time/finds him in the aftermath and has to take care of him while he recovers.

The Taisho period is my favorite in Japanese history; I’m very into the Taisho roman aesthetic, and overall there’s just something very romantic about the period -- it was a historical moment that straddled tradition and the past and modernity and the future in a lot of very interesting ways. I think the DSRK games really feed into that, you know? In a lot of ways the setting feeds into the game; Raidou is a traditional figure, supported by a cast of demons, who has to keep order in the capital - and inevitably chaos comes from the interaction of tradition and modernity. these are strong words for games in which robot zombie Rasputin and LITERAL SATAN are the antagonists, huh? Narumi/Raidou is my forever ship. I like that Narumi is technically there to keep an eye on Raidou but that in the day-to-day Raidou has to keep Narumi in line, I like that they’re opposites, Narumi all flash against Raidou’s quiet, Narumi representing modernity while Raidou is tradition. I LIKE THE AGE DIFFERENCE AND I LIKE THAT THEY’RE BOSS AND SUBORDINATE DON’T LOOK AT ME and I also like that they’re equals at the same time. I like that Narumi tries to take care of Raidou and protect him, in his own way, because he’s the adult. I like that Raidou doesn’t need it, not really, but that Narumi does it anyway.

So a lot of my comments and requests are heavily influenced by the anime, but I should be caught up by the time assignments are due, so feel free to write me either something anime or manga-based.

Overall, I guess the theme of what I like about all of them is how conflicted they are; they’re fundamentally opposed to each other, they can’t forgive each other, but they also still miss each other. Everything about Yona/Soo-won/Hak is miserable and complicated, but I’d love to read anything about the three of them, shipfic or gen.

I mean, they literally end the movie confessing their love for each other while having an unintentionally innuendo filled conversation. DON'T TELL ME THIS MOVIE ISN'T A ROMCOM. IT JUST DIDN'T END WITH THEM KISSING. So what if we change that ending and Katie actually loses her virginity to Lauren and not Sean? Or keep the ending the same, but have Katie realize that as much as she likes Sean, she truly loves Lauren. What if they get a little hot and bothered during one of their work calls and take it to a new level? (Or a slower burn with them going from friends-to-lovers over the course of their continuing relationship as friends/business partners.) I would be fine with a polyamorous Sean/Katie/Lauren thing, but I don't really have any interest in Sean/Katie separately. (I'm cool with any other film characters showing up where needed, but mostly just focused on the two leads.)\n\n(More info available at letter link.) \n\nPLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE: Ankle trauma.

I just found Anders and Alison so completely charming together and wanted more of them together, so here we are!\n\nOne idea I had was something years after the movie ends. We get a hint that Tom is at least willing to change his ways, so maybe he's finally ready to be the guy that can settle down and build a life with someone when he runs into Lucy who is recently divorced from George. (I'm okay if one or both of them have a kid from a previous relationship, but I'm also okay with absolutely no kids.) I just didn't feel Lucy/George were built to last and she just went with the first decent guy who was ready to get married. So maybe they just need some years to pass before they're in the right place to be with each other. Feel free to create stumbling blocks towards that happy ending, or have it end bittersweet (just not fully bitter), I'm game for whatever.

It would be interesting to see a pro-Purge faction try to come after them, and I imagine even though she's ended the Purge, there will still be groups who want it to continue and will come after Charlie to make that happen.

I tend to think about the women of the tanakh from an economic perspective, and from that perspective what the two of them are facing is so intense--in a society where a woman's economic well-being is so tied to the ability to have children, Naomi is facing not only a life without her beloved husband and sons but economic destitution and an old age as a beggar, and Ruth is signing on for privation and hardship and probably literally starving to death when she could go back and have a perfectly happy life without Naomi. That is super intense! What is Ruth thinking? Why would she do that?  What is their life like in the first weeks after the men die and when they're traveling and when they're back in Bethlehem, when they're facing the shock of their lives being turned upside down, without any real hope or options? What does Naomi think when Ruth first tells her about Boaz, is she afraid or hopeful? Does she worry or have second thoughts or feel guilty about what she sends Ruth to do? Does Ruth question her, or feel hopeful, or ashamed? Is Ruth happy or relieved in her life with Boaz, or does she feel any regret?

Alrich hints that he worked out quite quickly that the current Myfanwy wasn’t the old one — how does he deal with that? Alternatively, maybe they have to work a case together, with their different temperaments and personal habits leading to a crisis before they actually manage to work together properly. \n\nIf you wanted to go for something a bit cracky, you could put them in a room with an unlikeable operative or target who is vampire-obsessed and keeps on going on about vampires, while Myfanwy and Alrich try not to either a) laugh or b) break cover. \n\nIf you are going the casefic/crack route and you want a cameo from any famous vampires, there’s a good chance I’ll be familiar with your vampire-of-choice.\n\nLetter: http://winterhill.dreamwidth.org/1223.html\n\n\n"

Maybe Katsu is an unintentional cockblock, showing up when least expected (or required -- if you go with this idea, I'm not looking for Katsu to get involved, as it were). \n\nIf Katsu fix-it is not your bag, maybe something about the weird places Katsu goes, or an adventure Katsu has, either before or during canon, when the humans are off doing human things and Katsu gets some time to go exploring. What would happen if Katsu got into some sort of weird competition with an automaton such as the Mechanical Turk?

I requested Whyborne and Griffin but I am happy for any of the other characters in the tagset (or in the canon) to show up. I would prefer the canon pairings in this series.\n\nOne idea I’d like to see is the journey back from the Necropolis. It’s fade-to-black in canon, and I'd love to see what happened in it, especially because there’s the Whyborne/Christine friendship, and Christine’s budding relationship with Iskander. How frightened are Griffin and Christine that Whyborne might not make it? At what point does Kander work out he’s got nothing to worry about on the Whyborne &amp; Christine front? What does Whyborne say when he’s delirious? Is his magic fully under control, and what happens if it isn’t? \n\nAnother fairly specific prompt — Saul and a “sea cat” manage to have kittens…and suddenly Widdershins has an influx of half-cat half-cephalopods. I imagine Whyborne would worry terribly, but maybe a small purry abomination is just what the Library needs… and the Funeral Home…and Miss Parkhurst’s house…and Niles might be lonely… \n\nI would equally love a canon-adjacent AU for this one, like soulmates (e.g. one of the many versions of writing on the skin), a Sentinel/Guide AU, or a daemon AU (are Whyborne and Persephone’s daemons “twins” in some way? Was Griffin’s daemon forced to settle by his foster family? What happened to his daemon in the asylum? Do the ketoi have daemons, or do they have something else, like the armoured bears do, and what does that mean for Whyborne's daemon?)\n\nLetter: http://winterhill.dreamwidth.org/1223.html\n\n\n"

Rokugan is a world of high drama and, in particular, given the setting, I am explicitly okay with a tragic ending, since loyalty to a lover inherently conflicts with loyalty to one's lord or emperor, and this pairing involves an extramarital affair on top of that. That being said, don't feel obliged to go to the tragedy place--I'd equally enjoy a happy-for-now or happily-ever-after ending for these two.\n\nPrompts:\n- How did Kachiko and Hotaru meet and fall in love?\n- How much is Kachiko manipulating her lover, and how much does Bayushi Shoju (if you want to bring him in) know about what's going on?\n- Does Hotaru have tricks of her own up her sleeve? Is she countermanipulating Kachiko? I mean, she is the Crane Champion, and a Doji at that.\n- For the crack version, you could do bodyswap smut.\n- Or the Discord chat version of them flirting.\n\nNote: Visual reference of Hotaru can be found in a portrait in \"Her Father's Daughter\" [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/12/1d/121dfe67-eed4-401a-be54-fb1c6e35c169/her_fathers_daughter.pdf]; I don't believe Kachiko yet has a card or illustration in the LCG so these cards from the CCG are possibilities for visual reference: [http://imperialassembly.com/oracle/#hashid=5b38fca66c0791037386dd9ad596513b,#page=1] (I'm fondest of the Matt Wilson illustrations, but the Steve Argyle one is also lovely.)\n\nPlease see letter for additional details.\n\nDNWs: Harm of cute animals (RPG-style monster-slaying is fine), dysphoria, floods, and issuefic.\n\nLetter: http://yhlee.dreamwidth.org/2396434.html\n\n\n"

They both had to bear an awful weight—Bill as the leader, Mike as the keeper of Derry—so I've always liked the idea of them somehow finding relief/peace together in the end, too.\n* Explorations of the relationships between any of the main seven, platonic or romantic!

The fact that this show puts women into tech history exactly as they should be is already amazing, but smashing through the Bechdel Test with glorious flying colors is one of the many things I especially love about this show.- I continue to love the way they handle Joe's sexuality and indeed any queerness in the show. It warms my heart so much, especially considering the era. And casual bisexuality validation!!Amazing!!!!- I'm a tech geek and while I may not understand everything that is going on in the show, I really enjoy hearing characters explain how something could/could not work and really getting into it. Since all of the main cast are super competent and passionate about their work, it basically means I'm forever crying about how awesome everyone is, and therefore how awesome everyone is when they work together on something, dysfunctionality and all.- Speaking of dysfunctionality, one of my favorite types of relationships to explore is dysfunctional ones, especially ones handled with such complexity. There's just something about internecine relationships that are simultaneously one-of-a-kind in inspiring passion for life that really gets to me. Wow, just, people in relationships with other people whom they have a hard time getting along with, but still can't stay away from because there is no one else who can make them feel the way they do in this world. Crying forever jldkjslkSorry, I hope I'm not putting you off with a text wall!

How you might despair when you realize that no one will ever see the same view as you. But then suddenly, you're <em>not</em> the only person anymore. Someone else exists with the power to displace fate. And that someone is still young enough to believe in fate--in fact, they are not unlike how you once were.

I've always wondered about that southern coast and the Daddu-Yadu and Daddu-Ley caves, personally.* Since the Serpent of Time is on the character list, I'd love to see the Serpents and their creation fleshed out a bit; that illusionary god-hydra in Mampang is one of the most flavorful encounters in the entire series, and seriously, how does something like that even happen?

I'd really love to read a story dealing with the rooted-setting-entities of the Beanworld (Gran'Ma'Pa and the Fix-It Shop) and their greater relations to the Beanworld, because the bits we have are tantalizing. We know that the current cycle is wildly off-course, but how would a \"normal\" one have gone? Gran'Ma'Pa still listens to and answers prayers, but would those answers be more direct if not for the poisoning sustained during Mr. Spook's origin? Contrariwise, is the Fix-It-Shop doing *more* talking than normal to try and get the ambulatory elements of the system up to speed?  Do Gran'Ma'Pa and the Fix-It Shop communicate with one another? Do they have plans to make this all work out, somehow, before the end of the cycle? Feel free to give me your own worldbuilding speculations here -- there are so many possibilities and I'd love to read them all.This is another canon where I love the whole ensemble, so feel free to use who you like! I nominated Mr. Spook and Professor Garbanzo because they relate most closely to the setting-characters (and also because they're my favorites, because I am shameless). If you don't feel up for big worldbuilding, I'd also love some \"day-in-the-life\" stuff about the beans living their lives, either unseen stuff from spring or a continuing unfolding of summer.

Do rooms ever change, and what happens to their agents when they do?* The exploits of a group of non-magick-users embroiled in the Occult Underground; I've always liked the \"Tuxedo Squadron\" idea from the UA 2E core (stage magicians who went after the real secrets, discovered they weren't worth it, and are still stuck in the subculture), but there are a lot of options.

What other bits of electronics or AI have gained their own sentience or significance, and who do they talk to?Honestly, I’d be thrilled with you exploring just about any nook or cranny of this fascinating universe. I’d only ask that you maintain the source’s absurd yet optimistic and loving tone. Bittersweet and even a little elegiac is fine, I just don’t want anything grim or dark here. The world we’re living in right now has plenty of that. Also, do not feel the need to try any wild format/coding stuff the way Bois did if you don’t want to. A vanilla text story is more than enough for me.Letter: http://yasaman.dreamwidth.org/475905.html"

If you want to try a fanwork for this in IF or gamebook format, that would be really cool, but I would be equally happy with regular/static fic. (I know from experience that IF/gamebooks are time-consuming to write!)Second person would feel most natural to me given the source canon if you're doing the Adventurer as a POV, but I'm happy to read first or third if that works better for you.Also, feel free to bring in anyone, I mean anyone, from the series. I loved it all.If you're using this as an emergency fandom and only have access to one of the books, The Adventurer works for any of the four books and is probably the easiest choice. You get the most material on the Archmage in The Crown of Kings when the PC confronts him, but there's some backstory on him in the intro material for each book so you could use that as a basis. Flanker is a minor character from The Shamutanti Hills and Kharé. The Serpent of Time appears in The Seven Serpents.Alternately, feel free to do worldbuilding or generalized metafiction based on the gamebook(s), especially about games/game design, rather than focusing on a character or characters, if that speaks to you.The Adventurer- Five ways the Adventurer came to a bad end before getting to confront the Archmage of Mampang.- What if the Archmage corrupts the Adventurer and they turn against Analand?- Metafiction in which the Adventurer realizes that they're a gamebook character--what happens next?- What if ZED sent the Adventurer back even further in time and they changed the history of the entire series?- The Adventurer's diary, perhaps discovered centuries later by archaeologists or historians? Bonus points if it's hilariously misinterpreted, with footnotes.The Archmage of Mampang- The Archmage dealing with internal shenanigans at Mampang. The Crown of Kings made it sound pretty disorganized!- What is the Archmage up to while the Adventurer progresses? Maybe in the form of spy reports that he receives, whether from the Serpents or other servants.- How did the Archmage dispose of former Adventurers? After all, you can play the gamebook(s) over and over...- What happens if the Archmage gets a hold of the Analander Spell Book? Surely he would have uses of his own for ZED...- The Archmage's backstory and how he rose to power. What does his mom think of his career choice? This can be as silly or as serious as you want.Flanker- Post-series fic in which Flanker and the Adventurer become adventuring buddies!- What is Flanker's backstory? How did he get into a life of assassination?- Who are some of Flanker's other friends? He seems an honorable sort as assassins go, and it seems likely that he's made other contacts in the region.- Flanker out for a night drinking, maybe hanging out with other assassins and getting into philosophical arguments (or darts matches)?- Flanker on a completely different assassination mission in the region.Serpent of Time- The Serpent's bitter, bitter diary of its trials and tribulations trying to bring the Adventurer (or multiple Adventurers) to heel.- What kinds of errands does the Serpent get up to when it's not trying to stop an Adventurer?- What the Serpent does on its vacations. Feel free to get as silly/cracky as you want.- The Serpent and its brethren have many guises--feel free to explore any of them, or make up your own.- What happens if the Serpent survives a defeat and plots revenge?Please see letter for additional details.DNWs: Harm of cute animals (RPG-style monster-slaying is fine), dysphoria, floods, and issuefic.Letter: http://yhlee.dreamwidth.org/2396434.html"
