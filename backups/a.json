At the start, Dorothy was so clearly thrown off-kilter by being sent to a world with completely different rules than her own, but she learned to play by them and play by them well. I also love how emotional she could be. When something affected her, it was clear for everyone to see.\n\nFor this fandom, I’d like to see something that picks up where the show left off. I think there’s so much to explore there, with Dorothy returning to Oz and also being around Lucas/Roan again. Something that shows them trying to figure out where they stand with each other now would be much appreciated. They were lovers and they were enemies, and they very nearly killed each other.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).\n\nProvost’s Dog - Tamora Pierce (Sabine)\nI’ve been reading Tamora Pierce’s books since I was a kid, and about two years ago I did a re-read of everything she’s written. I wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the Provost’s Dog trilogy when it originally came out, but the second time around I got so much out of it. As an adult, I loved seeing the Tortall of the past, as well as all these events/trends/movements/etc that created the Tortall we see in Pierce’s other books.\n\nSabine in particular is a great example of this. We tend to think that as time moves forward society gets more progressive, but Sabine is a lady knight in a society that is becoming more narrow in its gender roles. It would be fantastic to receive something that explores that more. How does the Cult of Gentle Mother affect her life as a knight, or even her life farther down the line when she’s put down her sword? How does it affect women knights as a whole? Alternately, something that shows Sabine processing/recovering from Tunstall’s betrayal and coming to terms with the inequality he saw in their relationship would be wonderful, as would something showing her relationships with Bekah and/or Clary in the wake of this.\n\nLetter: http://faleronofkingsreach.tumblr.com/post/166124568531/yuletide-letter-2017\n\n\n"},{"username": "alessandriana","fandom": "Yoroiden Samurai Troopers | Ronin Warriors ","characters": "Shuu Rei Fuan | Kento Rei Fang, Sanada Ryou | Ryo Sanada, Hashiba Touma | Rowen Hashiba","prompt": "Hello author!

How does it feel to be in a Rite? What relationship do they have to the Reader? Or you could write about the revolution, and the Commonwealth, and how these people change the world &lt;3 Feel free to pick any mix of liberated people - whatever suits the story. I don’t have one particular solid headcanon for this game; part of what I like about it is that it feels like there are good things and bad things for any given ending for any given character.\n\nJodariel is the best, and I ship her like crazy with everyone. Her design is super appealing to me for one thing, with her buff arms and her horns and the way she moves in the Rites, both hulking and graceful. I love her mixture of kindness and reserve and frosty defensiveness - you can see how her history has shaped her, made her afraid and defensive, but also how incredibly kind she is. I’m up for any kind of story about her life in the Downside, but especially stories that focus on her place in the Nightwings, and how she feels about the other characters (I started to write out notes about individual relationships, realised how long it would be, and gave up. But I love all of them). Or how her life changes if she’s Liberated.\n\nPamitha is incredible. She’s beautiful, she’s snarky, she can fly. What’s not to love??? I really love her story with her sister, and how she begs you to lose the liberation rite against the Essence. A story about her and Tabitha would be incredible - whether they’re both liberated, only one of them is, or they both stay Downside.\n\nThe Moon-Touched Girl is great. I really like the way in which she’s odd - her perspective on reality might not be the same as other people, but it has its own internal logic. And she can be very sharp and intuitive. Her backstory hints at sadness, but it’s not the point of her character - her story is as much about her present and future as the experiences that led her to the Nightwings. I love her interactions with basically everyone - a fic about how she sees the other characters would be fantastic. Or a story about her experiences after the end of the game, especially if she is chosen in the Liberation Rite. (I called her Mae, as a nod to Night in the Woods, but give her whatever name you like for her.)\n\nGiven how much choice you have about the Reader, there’s a lot of different options. The only thing that I ask is that you make the Reader female - since I prefer my reader ships f/f. Otherwise, you can use whatever backstory you prefer. I chose the crippled scholar, and I do like the implications of the Reader being physically disadvantaged - the way that plays into their role in the Rites. But use whatever suits your feelings and story. As for story prompts: honestly, I think I’m mostly interested in fic about the Reader’s in story feelings. How do they feel about the role they were thrust into? How do they make their decisions about who to choose for Liberation? Or post-game fic about the consequences of their choices would also be fascinating.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShip-wise, I adore Jodariel/Pamitha, as a fabulous enemies-to-lovers ship (and this is one that I would be totally up for porn with - between Jodariel’s horns and Pamitha’s wings there is some really good potential, plus I could see them having a lot of fun with bondage - though who’s tying up who is a serious question). I’d love stories that tackle how they might get together, whether it’s slow burn, or a physical relationship that awkwardly dredges up feelings. (If you’re writing slow burn, don’t feel obliged to include the whole relationship. A short fic that was entirely stumbling blushes and awkward touches and the promise of something more down the line would be incredible.)\n\nI also really like Jodariel/Moon-Touched Girl. It’s protrayed more as a familial relationship in canon, but I could easily see it becoming romantic. Though I imagine the Moon-Touched Girl would have to initiate things (and in fic with age differences, I do usually prefer the younger person to take the lead).\n\nJodariel/Reader is also great - partly because I am weak and Jodariel is hot, and partially because I think she’s the one of the companions who takes the most work. Getting her to open up and trust you is tricky, and I always like a puzzle that’s hard to solve. I particularly enjoy this ship as one where Jodariel is much taller and stronger than the Reader, because I am shallow.\n\nSince I’m requesting the Reader, I’ll mention that I also really like Reader/Sandra. Obviously, Sandra wasn’t nominated, so this is very, very optional, but I did find their relationship fascinating. The tensions that exist in a situation where the Reader has all the power, Sandra’s loneliness and sarcasm and longing for companionship, the complications of not being able to touch - it is all such good stuff.\n\nLetter: http://amazing-e-ko.dreamwidth.org/2983.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Amazing_E_ko","fandom": "響け! ユーフォニアム | Hibike!

I like to think that music is important to them for the rest of their lives.\n\nIf you’re writing shippy fic (and I ship the heck out of these two), I’d love a fic about them in college, or even later in their life. I like to imagine them both as professional musicians, eventually, and it would be really interesting to read a fic about how that plays into a romantic relationship between them. Something about them figuring out their feelings would be great - especially if there’s mutual pining. Or something about them in an established relationship, and how they juggle work and time commitments and all those other things. Reina is a genius, and while Kumiko has talent, she’s not quite at the same level, so that seems like something they might have to work around.\n\nLetter: http://amazing-e-ko.dreamwidth.org/2983.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Amazing_E_ko","fandom": "Mansfield Park - Jane Austen ","characters": "Fanny Price, Mary Crawford","prompt": "I’m happy with both the Fanny/Edmund and Fanny/Henry, and if you want to include either in your story, I’ll enjoy them, but I have to confess that I would kill for a Fanny/Mary story that does what so many Fanny/Henry stories do, and breaks away from canon to write a different ending. I’m always a sucker for femslash, and the dynamic between Fanny and Mary is one that fascinates me. It has a lot of the same appeal as Fanny/Henry - that in falling for one of the Crawfords, Fanny truly changes her perspective on someone, and it pushes her away from the traditional Bertrams towards a more modern group of people. I also think it creates interesting tensions in Mary and Henry's relationship, and Fanny and Edmund's. On top of that, I actually really enjoy stories that are about starting relationships against the pressures of society and working out a way to be happy while dealing with repression. As long as they have happy endings. And I would ask, if you write this, that you give them a happy ending. I don't need them to be universally accepted by everyone around them, out and proud, but I would like them to be happy with each other.\n\n* One thing that would be very interesting is to see Mary and Fanny in a completely different setting: perhaps in Mary’s London circle. I don’t think Fanny would be at all comfortable, that’s what would be so interesting.\n\nFanny is a great character. She’s extremely insecure, but in an incredibly relatable way, and despite her insecurity she has a will of absolute iron. She’s got a lot of insight into people, but she can also be very blind, especially as it concerns herself. And all of this is bound up in her morality. Fanny is an extremely ethical person, though her standards of ethics and morality don’t totally align with a modern perspective. I think her consistent desire to do what is right, rather than what is easy, is part of what makes her such a great character, but she doesn’t always consider other people’s perspectives, and it would be cool to see a fic that challenge some of her presumptions of the world.\n* I’d love a fic where Fanny is, for whatever reason, trapped in a room making conversation with someone she would normally never talk to. Again, that idea of pushing at her boundaries a little, and exploring what her limits are, but also maybe giving her a chance to reconsider an assumption, really appeals to me. The person she’s talking to could be someone like the Admiral, Mary and Henry’s uncle, or one of Mary’s friends, or even one of the Admiral’s mistresses.\nFanny’s refusal of Mr. Crawford is one of my favourite parts of the book, even though I like fic where they do get married. That enduring and tenacious refusal is such a powerful plot point. I’d love to see fic about other times in her life when she had to draw on that stubbornness. (If you wanted to make this a ‘five times’ fic you totally could - I’m always a fan of those, but just one time would be equally interesting.)\n\nMary fascinates me because of the many ways in which she serves as a foil to Fanny. They’re great mirror images of each other. She’s superficially much more decisive and strong-willed than Fanny, but underneath she’s actually much more reliant on what other people think of her. In an odd way, she’s also very insecure. She really needs to be liked by other people, I think, really wants the approval of those around her. Whereas Fanny, though she feels that she doesn’t really deserve love and affection, is very good at relying on her own inner resources.\n* A fic about Mary’s past, and her childhood, would be delightful. It’s only touched on very briefly in the story, but she must have had an extremely challenging childhood, between the deaths of her parents and being raised in a house with an aunt she loved and an uncle she hated. There’s a line in the book where Fanny says that Mary shouldn’t speak ill of her uncle, even though he’s not a good person, and while it’s completely true by the mores of Jane Austen’s time, I kind of love Mary for refusing to bow to those standards and pretend that her uncle is a good person when he pretty clearly isn’t.\n* There’s a comparison that’s often made between Austen and Mary Crawford - that although Mary is the antagonist, she’s a lot more similar to Austen than Fanny is. I don’t entirely know how fair that is, but it did give me the idea of Mary becoming a writer like her creator, and I think that could make for a great fic. Maybe, years later, she writes about a fictionalised version of the events of Mansfield Park? It would be really interesting to see how she might revisit that story in later years, and what, if anything, she would change.\n\nLetter: http://amazing-e-ko.dreamwidth.org/2983.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Amazing_E_ko","fandom": "Little Witch Academia ","characters": "Atsuko \"Akko\" Kagari, Diana Cavendish","prompt": "It actually took me a while to sit down and watch this anime, but I loved it to pieces when I did.

One thing I really like about her is that although she can be kind of lazy and flaky and impatient, we actually see her putting in the work. She really fights for her skills, and I love every moment when her earnestness and hard-work and determination shine through. She’s so sincere and sweet. I’d love a story about her learning magic, and improving. The magic in the series is so fun and creative, and I really like the world, so just Akko studying could make for a brilliant fic.\n\nDiana is interesting - I like her in the series a lot more than in the original OVA. I love her kindness, and her determination to do the right thing, and the walls she puts up to hide her generosity and compassion. She’s genuinely a really good person, underneath the arrogance and standoffishness. I’d be particularly interested in stories about her relationship to her family, and how she feels about her heritage. Or stories about her in the ‘normal’ world, where she can’t use her magic and has to rely on her other skills.\n\nAnd of course, I adore Diana/Akko as a ship. Getting together fic would be great, or fic about them working out exactly what it is they feel for each other. The series has a lot of tropey fun with things like the love bee, and I would love a fic where maybe some magical mishaps forces them to confront feelings they might not otherwise acknowledge. I think Akko and Diana are two people who are really good for each other, and they push and challenge each other in ways that make them both better people - which I guess is the ideal.\n\nLetter: http://amazing-e-ko.dreamwidth.org/2983.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "ambyr","fandom": "British Government Cats RPF ","characters": "Palmerston (British Government Cats RPF)","prompt": "I admit it: in the Larry vs. Palmerston feud, I am a Palmerston partisan.

I don’t care. I want it not to be. I want all the stories where Richard and Philip fell as powerfully in lust and/or in love as Eleanor and Henry before them. Richard was widely known as being extremely attractive – 6’5”, powerful, reddish-gold hair, dynamic and decisive. I know less about Philip’s canonical looks, but I do love <a href=\"https://s25.postimg.org/whtq0xaun/amiel_portrait.jpg\">this 19th century portrait of him</a>, whether or not it’s accurate. \n\nAny of my general likes that fit this situation would be excellent here! (See my letter for general likes/prompts.) How does their relationship begin? When does Richard go from ‘enemy of my dad is my friend, let’s go talk to Phil and see if he’ll help’ to ‘shit, Phil grew UP’? Did Philip initially only intend to make his friendship with Richard tighter, and then once they’re in bed together for the grand Photo-Op of Friendship for the benefit of the court (and to disturb Richard’s father), realise that he’s got himself into bed with a tall drink of water? Do they joke about the complicated political situation in between stealing kisses in the garden? Is Richard the first guy Philip’s been with? Does either give the other symbolic jewelry/other presents? Does Richard joke about wanting to marry Philip instead of Philip’s half-sister Alys? \n\nAnything set during the period from 1187-1189, while Richard &amp; Philip were allied against Henry, would be amazing. I feel like this would be the happiest time for them, before Henry died and Richard became king, putting his relationship with Philip on an uneasier footing (given the power dynamics at play between France and England) and eventually leading to open conflict. All the happy falling-in-love, scheming-against-one’s-father, two ruthless young men falling in lust and love, as you can manage. :D\n\nBut this isn’t the only possible time period, of course! After Richard became King, he went on the Third Crusade with Philip and others, determined to rescue Jerusalem from Saladin. This could also be a very fruitful setting for fic. I think it’s really interesting that one of the reasons both Richard and Philip went on Crusade at the same time was that they were afraid that if one of them stayed behind he’d take advantage of the other’s absence to go after his land! It’s hard to be friends/lovers when you’re rival monarchs. :( If you’re writing shipfic during this time, I’d prefer a bittersweet tone that remembered good times of the past over a darker angst one, though there’s certainly angst to be had aplenty as Richard and Philip’s relationship unravels over the course of the Crusade. \n\nFeel free to use as much or as little of the politics of the Third Crusade as you like. I love history, and I love historical detail, so if you’re a gen writer and you want to write complicated-friendship fic about how Richard and Philip quarrelled over Cyprus, go for it. On the other hand, if you want to write a mostly-history-free story about Richard and Philip’s last night together before Philip leaves the Crusade and goes back to France, I’d love that too! \n\nI would also love a fic set in an AU where men marrying each other is totally normal (though rare among royalty because of the need for heirs), and Richard and Philip fall in love and decide to get married and combine their kingdoms (much to Henry and Eleanor’s probable dismay). It would work out heir-wise because Philip’s son Louis was born in 1187 and his wife Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, so he’d have been a widower free to marry for love at that point. (Or you could delete Philip’s marriage entirely, though in that case I’m not sure what they would have done for an heir. Mpreg? Adoption being a legitimate way to acquire royal heirs?)

And Barbara, being the astute woman she is, would notice that while Horatio is cooling his heels waiting for his next command, and Bush is valiantly struggling not to hate his post, the one thing that cheers them up is each other's company... And then Horatio comes back from the Baltic terribly sick, owing his life to Bush, who has such a hard time relinquishing the nursing duties, and he and Barbara could bond over Horatio's sickbed...\nAnd then they all work out an arrangement and raise Richard Arthur together and there's no Caudebec, right?\n\nLetter: http://anndybanndy.dreamwidth.org/7964.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "annemari","fandom": "Mechanical Hearts - J.C.

I have some suggestions, but I really love the universe of the Good Place and will be into whatever you produce.\n\nI like romantic stuff, and I ship Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani, so if that's up your alley, feel free to write about any or all of those ships. I don't have any preference among the three, and will be super pleased with anything you produce. I'm totally fine with smut, but I don't like dubcon (and I don't think it makes a ton of sense with these characters anyway?) I also really love Jason/Janet if that's something  you're interested in including. In terms of characters I really like, I love the entirety of Team Cockroach, Vicki, and Trevor.\n\nIn terms of specific prompts or ideas, I'd love to see any of the reboots from \"Dance Dance Resolution\" that are only hinted at - any of the times the gang went to Mindy St. Clair's, the Eleanor/Tahani soulmate attempt, and the one where the whole group is spying on the clown conveyor belt for whatever reason are all some of my favorite canon reboots. I'm also super open to any reboot scenario you want to go with. I especially like the idea of using reboots to do kind of trope-heavy AU stuff - there's a fic in the tag that's a university AU that I really like. \n\nIf Eleanor hasn't shown Chidi the tape yet by the time you're writing this or there's a different way you'd like to imagine that interaction playing out, that would be super cool. I also like the idea of a version where Eleanor says I love you to Tahani. \n\nCool, mindblowing stuff is definitely going to happen on the show after I write this, so if that inspires you to do something else, definitely do it. I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. \n\nThanks!\n\n\n"},{"username": "antivillain","fandom": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) ","characters": "Rebecca Bunch, Heather Davis, Valencia Perez, Greg Serrano","prompt": "Hey, \n\nFirst things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love CEG and its characters and will be into whatever you produce.\n\nI like romantic stuff, but with the caveat that I think shipping fics are a bit different for CEG given that the majority of the characters are not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. I like Rebecca/Greg, Rebecca/Valencia, and Rebecca/Heather most in fics when they explicitly acknowledge that the relationship is unhealthy (R/G especially) or, even better, both people are in a better place mentally and emotionally or are getting there together. I also love Heather/Valencia and Darryl/White Josh, and am totally fine with traditional, fluffy romance for them, because they deserve it and are way more ready for that than Rebecca. I'm totally okay with smut for any of the pairings listed, but I don't want dubcon. \n\nAlthough I couldn't list them, I love Paula, Darryl, White Josh, Hector, and Father Brah and would love to any of them included if it makes sense for your story. \n\nIn terms of non-romantic stuff, I'm obsessed with the girl gang and would love to just see a story about them scheming against Josh, or really just hanging out. I would love to see a parody/takeoff of Gone Girl with Rebecca. I'd also be interested in seeing Rebecca and Greg just interact at this point without being romantic at all - maybe Greg hears about the wedding debacle and calls her/flies back to West Covina for some reason and sees her? I'm really curious as to whether Greg actually managed to break his patterns and succeed at Emory, and I miss Greg/Rebecca interactions, so if you want to take it in that direction, I'd be down.\n\nSince the season hasn't started yet, it's really hard to predict what cool stuff might come up, so if there's anything that happens in s3 that you really want to write about, go for it! I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about.

I have some suggestions, but I really love this show  and will be into whatever you produce.\n\nI ship Phil/Rita, and I like romantic fics, so if you're into that kind of thing, definitely go for it! I really  like AUs - some AU ideas I'm into are ones where the loop ends at a different time, Rita and Phil are both in the loop, completely different AUs like the college AU in the tag. I also like the idea of deleted scenes from within the loop - how did Phil interact with Rita during the time between If I Had My Time Again and Seeing You, when he was trying to help out the town? Did he ever tell Rita about the loop after the one day we see? Future fics are also great, especially ones where Phil has to figure out how to tell Rita about the loop or is kind of angsty about how much he already loves her when she really doesn't know him. \n\nIf you're not into Phil/Rita or romance, I really love any stories you might have about life for Phil during or after the loop. I like fun stories during the Philandering time period where Phil gets up to some crazy stuff, stories about Phil going back to Punx at some point and what that would be like, or just whatever you can think of. In terms of Rita-centric fic, I'd love to see a fic from her pov at any point in the loop, especially the day Phil tells her about the loop, or literally anything about her background/family. I like the idea that Rita and Phil become best friends even if they're not romantic.\n\nThese are all just some ideas if you're looking for inspiration - I will love whatever you write!

I think you could write anything to do with the world and I would be happy!  But what do I particularly like about?  I think it was the idea that the Headmaster had such power, that he could make you do anything - and yet despite that you could still fight back if you were clever enough and brave enough and willing to sacrifice yourselves to save the world.  \n\nI'd be very very happy with any obvious 'Demon Headmaster comes up with Evil Plan, SPLAT defeat him' story.  Or Dinah's backstory has always fascinated me - bounced around foster homes and children's homes, learning to hide her cleverness - what happened to her before she went to live with the Hunters?  Alternatively I will always think of Dinah as 'my age', and I'm now in my thirties, so what happened to SPLAT?  Did they grow up, marry, have jobs and kids?  What would happen if they had to overthrow the Demon Headmaster as adults in 2017 instead of as children in the 80s?  \n\nI adore the first two books which I read when I was young, but (blush!) kind of think of the rest of the series as fanfic that just happens to be written by Gillian Cross, so don't worry at all if you just want to treat the first book as canon and then go off piste.  But I know the rest and mostly like them, and if characters from later books show up that's great too :-)  I've never seen the TV show.\n\nNo real DNWs I can think of, although for me the Headmaster is always in it for the power and for making things neat and tidy and stripping away untidy emotions - I can't imagine any story where the Headmaster used his powers for sexual control ringing true for me.\n\nWhile I like dark stories about loss of control and powerlessness, I also like cracky funny things too, and have a bit of a soft spot for crossovers, if you're sitting there thinking 'what I want to write is a Harry Potter crossover where SPLAT are magic and get sorted into Hogwarts houses and the Demon Headmaster tries to hypnotise Dumbledore' that is not going to make me sad :-)\n\n\n"},{"username": "atreic","fandom": "A Saturday Life - Radclyffe Hall ","characters": "Francis (A Saturday Life)","prompt": "Dear Author,\n\nSo, err, this is a really rarely read book by a pretty uncommonly read author.  I'm almost tempted to skip writing these optional details, as I find it so hard to believe I've actually matched on this one!  And given how miraculous and wonderful it would be to find anyone else in the world who has read this book and likes it enough to want to write fic about it, you can write whatever you want, and it will warm my heart and make me happy.\n\nThat aside, and with the knowledge that optional details are optional, oh Frances.  Frances, Frances, Frances.  The whole book leaves me in such a twisted conundrum of liking and respect and frustration and pity and love for Frances.  In so many ways, she's the one that makes everything happen - right at the start she's the one who finds Sidonia a dancing teacher, she's the person who knows the Ferrari's and introduces Sidonia to them, she's even the person who first says to Lady Shore that Sidonia must meet boys.  But all that happens grieves her so much, yet she never gives up her loyalty and love.  'So long as you're happy', as she says to Sidonia at the end (juxtaposing against her comment to David, in response to 'are you really happy?', 'No of course now, nobody is')\n\nI think it's the ambiguity and the way she is always betwixt and between things that intrigues me - close friends, but never fully family, mannish, yet still a woman, and always torn between Lady Shore and Sidonia.   \n\nErr, I guess that's more of a ramble, and not much of a prompt.  Just give me anything that gives me another view into Frances.  Whether that's her and Lady Shore, older and still content together.  Or some crazy fix it fic where Sidonia comes to her senses (or at least changes her fads again) and Frances has to stand up finally to the insufferable David and help her escape.  Letters from Frances, Frances's journal, any scene from the book told from her point of view.  What was in her mind during that unbearable scene where Sidonia, so full of teenage naivity, throws herself at Frances begging her to throw off her mother, and love _her_ - 'aren't I attractive?  I don't want to marry anyone, I just want to work and have you, all of you' ?  Sidonia thinks, so casually so much later 'I would have liked to take her away from Mother - thank God I didn't success in doing that, what a mess I'd be in now!'  Is she right?  Or is there an alternative world where Frances and Sidonia run off together for Wild Adventures?  What does Frances want?  Can she ever get it, and have a small slice of the happiness she doesn't believe in?\n\n[Oh, it's a terribly long shot, but I'm guessing someone who's bothered to read A Saturday Life has probably read other Radclyffe Hall as well, and I will admit, I would love to read the fic where Stephen Gordon, Elizabeth Rodney and Frances Reide get together over tea (or something stronger) and have a real safe space where they are all variants on God's pattern together, and can talk and be understood (and probably bitch a lot!) ]\n\n\n"},{"username": "atreic","fandom": "Master Song - Leonard Cohen (Song) ","characters": "You (Master Song)","prompt": "Dear Author,\n\nThis song!  With all the Complicated Feels, and the Ambiguity, and the Imagery!  \n\nThere's lots of things I could say about what I'm looking for, but I don't really know what I'm looking for other than tell me the story that you find in the song.  I worry that if I say too much about how I read what's going on, that will muddy the water, and maybe the delight of this fandom is the scope for interpretation, and going where it takes you.  If your story was sparked by the song, then that's all I was looking for.\n\nOn the other hand, if your yuletide is full of Bears, and you want some inspiration about what I see in the song and what interests me, here are some vague notes.  Read them if you want to.\n\n- The relationship of going away (with the Master) and returning, and the bitterness of the man she's returned to (your love is dust) yet his inability to leave her (your prisoner)\n\n- and yet it's more complicated than that.  He sent her to the Master? (And I sent you to him with my guarantee)  He loved the master too?  (I loved your master perfectly) He was certain she'd return and still love him?  ( I taught him how you would long for me no matter what he said)   Was that true?  Or was the Master's spell too strong? She has come back...\n\n- the power dynamics, the mastery and submission (will you kneel beside this bed ... a collar of leather and nails ...  your master)\n\n- the religious imagery.  (wine and bread... some temple... he hands you the apple core...) Maybe there is a reading where the Master isn't another man she's left him for, but a religious experience?  Or both?\n\n- that powerful sadness, that the man thinks she loves the Master because of the differences between him and the Man, some of which are choices of the Man's own making.  (I'm sure that he told you everything I must keep locked away in my head... he never once made you explain or talk about all of the little details)\n\n- the hint that although the Master has given her total bliss (cruised above the ribbons of rain... erased the final wisps of pain) he has also failed her somehow (your love ... never stops not even when your master fails.)\n\n- all the glory of sex (His body is a golden string that your body is hanging from) and the shaming of sex (your thighs are a ruin, you want too much... your love is a secret all over the block)\n\n- the song is so one sided, and the Man is so confident he knows what has happened.  But is he right?  What story do we see if we give a voice to the Woman?  Has she come back to give crumbs to a prisoner she pities, while she's still in love with the Master?  Or is it all a bit more complicated than that?\n\nSo any story about complicated relationships, about loving someone, and loving someone else, and leaving and returning - particularly that strange dynamic where actually they both love the Master, and this whole situation has happened because of something the Man did to cause it all to happen - that would work for me.   But really, just go where the song takes you, if actually you just get one scrap of lyric stuck in your head and want to spin a whole story out of that, that's totally fine by me too :-)\n\n\n"},{"username": "aunt_zelda","fandom": "Siberia (TV) ","characters": "Sam (Siberia), Irene (Siberia), Daniel (Siberia), Sabina (Siberia)","prompt": "Hello stranger!
