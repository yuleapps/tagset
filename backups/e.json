Atra grounding Kudelia with loving openness, and Kudelia sharing her hopes and plans so that the two of them can see it through together. They are so precious to each other from the start, I really enjoy the way their bond evolves along friendship and respect to loving comfort.

Helpful application of sulphuric acid!\n- Alternately, I have this craving for the strange domesticity of their Vatican life; maybe Roberto and Hiraga moving together and navigating the shores of their life together? Dinners and shopping and taking care and this easy, benign understanding they have for each other (honestly, I was dead and gone on the canon from their very scene together, where Hiraga admits to playing his game for the whole night in hopes that it would somehow help his little brother, and Roberto just going with it without missing a beat - and then, well, going to clean and iron for Hiraga, as one does).\n- For some reason I'd really love an old-fashioned sickfic for this fandom. Fever, pain, tender care, gentle blanket-tucking... It just feels like it would really suit. (Somehow I feel it combines well with the previous option)\n- I'm sure this wasn't the last time Julia had tried to convert them both to his case, and the events in the finale will most definitely come back to haunt them. So, how?\n- Somebody once described Roberto's feelings for Hiraga as 'pining while already being in committed relationship,' and just. Yes. Hiraga is at once so obviously full of love, and so oblivious of it, that there are endless possibilities for angst here, and I want all of them.\n- ...on unrelated note, I feel like this is the canon where I can actually mention, in Yuletide, that I have a crucifixion kink a mile wide. So, I have a crucifixion fic a mile wide, and Roberto is an ideal candidate.\n- Bonus option: If you like to serious-ify a cracky canon, go for it! The show uses a very anime kind of Catholicism, mostly aesthetics and trappings, but I'm fascinated with how injecting a bit of the real deal will change things (or not): the actual everyday application of faith, you know? For example, we know from the novels that Hiraga is a true believer but Roberto mostly treats his position as a job that gives him access to old books; I wonder if the canon events changed it, for both of them.\n- A completely non-obligatory bonus ridiculous crossover option on the chance you're into VME and Wynnona Earp at once: how would Roberto and Hiraga deal with the case that includes actual magic and demons from Hell?\n\nIf you like Lauren, I'm of the opinion that Lauren makes everything better (and makes for an ideal outsider's POV). \n\nFandom-specific DNW caveat:\n- For me, the allure of this relationship, given that both of them are priests, is that they are completely devoted to each other, but they're also at peace with being celibate.

However, if you’re more into exploring that on a platonic/gen level, I’m down for that, too. ^_^ As mentioned in the general likes/dislikes section, I also have a HUGE fealty/loyalty kink, and Will and Bran definitely have a healthy helping of that going on.

And one of the most compelling parts of the story to me is the relationship between Byron and Seymour. Byron, the charming bard and sometime rogue, who’s being hunted down for pissing off the wrong powerful lord once too often, but is determined to make a secure future for himself and for the people he comes to care about, too (like Seymour), and Seymour, the forever fearful amateur wizard, hunted by the same offended lord as Byron, his greatest crime being to be born the son of a great and powerful wizard… and not live up to his legacy. He wants nothing more than to hide away from everyone and everything and be a disappointment in peace, and yet somehow he and Byron make for the most unlikely of friends, a decision to help Byron being the thing that forces Seymour back into the land of the living, whether he wants it or not.

Why? They clearly judge and inform him prior to this. I'd love the pair of them realizing how on guard Maia is around them, that their actions have had this effect, and that it isn't a benefit to anyone - least of all Maia.\n\nMaia And His Health/Food/Identity:  The novel constantly repeats subtle nods at Maia's health: he skips his meals or eats little, has no appetite, has awful headaches, refuses to look at himself in the mirror, and others comment and ask if he's well. I feel he's disassociating from himself as a way to handle how little he recognizes who he has become. How that could be remedied or resolved? I'd prefer this to focus on it being a result of stress and fixing the issue, not as Maia with an eating disorder.\n\nMaia and his kidnapping: When Maia's questioned, after being kidnapped, he admits plainly that he'd have signed his abdication knowing that it would mean his death. He's upset about this, but also resigned. I would love a look into how little Maia values his own life beyond the power he represents, and how that affects his staff.\n\nWorld Build Bonus points: The practice of Nohecharei have been an institution for centuries and are always provided by a set group: There's no way that nothing was written, over the years, about best care and practice of guarding your Emperor against harm both inside and out.

They have apparently perfected the carrot &amp; stick dynamic, and gorilla has deemed “prilla” to mean “duo for life.” If that’s not true love, I don’t know what is??\n\n5) Give me anything ex-rox (smeb, peanut, kuro, pray, gorilla) and I will love you forever. Give me AU where they stayed together, give me a completely different AU (HP/superhero/whatever), give me random anecdotes from their time playing together, because they’re a family T____T\n\n6) I have a soft spot for smeb/score, especially for their stupid shenanigans on KT. stories of them bullying deft or pawn as the crazy duo, how they bonded, anything goes\n\n7) I love bengi, I love faker, and I really miss having them on the same team together (they were together for four years!!) Maybe something with 2016 all stars shenanigans (including smeb, pray, cpt jack, and madlife if you’d like) or an AU where bengi doesn’t leave (please <strike>don’t</strike> break my heart) or... retirement AU.\n\nLetter: http://goo.gl/k18vAv\n\n\n"},{"username": "eloboosting","fandom": "她们的故事 | Their Story ","characters": null,"prompt": "I absolutely adore this webcomic, especially the way tan jiu handles humor while also balancing it with serious moments that increase character depth.

Maybe something retrospective as she grows up, or her thoughts when Edgar arrives and she realises Perse's waking up again? She says she's not an artist any more, but has she ever felt the \"itch\" in the intervening years? Late in the book she tells Edgar, \"You will want to, but you mustn't\" - did she try to bring Melda back as well? What if it had worked, either as a 'came back wrong' thing or a bittersweet haunting? (An AU where Melda survived would also be very welcome.)\n\nLikewise with Melda, I'd love anything from her POV. What struck me most when I was reading is how young she was when all this happened, and maybe not as able to act freely because of her position in the household, but she's still practical and decisive and instantly willing to believe Elizabeth. Had she heard about people dealing with something similar before, or even had supernatural encounters himself? King does love his childhood closet monsters. Maybe after Edgar has drowned Perse to sleep again, Melda and Elizabeth's ghosts can join forces to save a few of the souls on her ship!\n\nAnd as for Perse, I just want any kind of exploration of her - her history and origins, her weird affinity with art, her shifting forms. Does she have any goal besides causing chaos? The ship is fascinating: is it a reflection of her, a prison for the people she takes, or even a literal ship that she's trying to crew so she can sail it somewhere? When she offers Edgar power, is that just a desperate lie, or has she had that kind of relationship with other artists in the past? If you're familiar with any of King's other work, it might be fun to try and fit her into his pantheon of evil gods - I feel like she and Rose Madder might be related.\n\nLetter: http://secretstaircase.dreamwidth.org/41240.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "elwing_alcyone","fandom": "Pocket Mirror (Video Game) ","characters": null,"prompt": "DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.\n\nWhen I played this game I was so drawn to Harpae and Lisette and their twisted feelings towards Goldia.

Maybe the unlockable \"secret room\" is not just a game feature.
