RH Plus 
Kiyoi (RH Plus), Michitaka | Mister

In general, I like fics that either emulate the style of the source material or that work to subvert that style in an interesting way. I love happy endings, first time stories, stories about friendship, adventure stories, introspective pieces, comedies and angst! You see, I really will be happy with whatever you write! I love AUs and crossovers, if you're struck by one of those (my LJ profile should give you a hint as to the fandoms I know - I'm not into many of the large fandoms of the last few years). As for what I don't like, non-consensual sex and sex with children written as erotica, and graphic harm to children and animals are not my fictional cup of tea.

&nbsp;

I'd love a story where either Michitaka or Kiyoi gets caught up in some trouble that only the other can help with - whether Michitaka needs help in being extricated from some vampire politics, or Kiyoi and the boys find they need extra help when new vampire hunters come to town, etc. (The other characters are lovely, but if you don't find they fit in your story, that's fine!)

Jimmy Perez, Duncan Hunter

Jimmy and Duncan have incredible chemistry and the show has a lot of fun with their life as co-parents. So, bring the slash and fill in some of the backstory. Did they have a history before Cassie’s mom? Was that the first time Duncan’s moved in? Does pretty much everyone on the island (including Cassie) think they’re doing it, but they’re oblivious? I’m also happy to read casefic and I’m a big fan of Tosh. Please don’t make Cassie’s mom (or any other woman) a villain, and please don’t make sexual violence a plot point.

Utopia | Dreamland (Australian TV) 

As a fan of shows like “The Thick of It” and “Twenty Twelve,” I was delighted to discover this show on Netflix this summer. I’m not Australian, so I’m probably missing half the jokes, but if you write anything about the Nation Building Authority and its denizens, I’ll be thrilled. I’m not that interested in their personal lives (one exception might be Nat trying to explain her job to her friends) but would happily read a story about a new project or political crisis, or maybe backstory on what they were all doing before.

Broadchurch 
Alec Hardy, Ellie Miller (Broadchurch)

Do I ever love this show! It's so heavy and atmospheric without being totally devoid of hope, and I'd be equally happy with a story that carries the canon's tone or with something softer. I have a hard time picturing David Tennant in any role other than "gruff Scottish detective" now; Hardy won me over as soon as I learned he took the fall for his ex-wife to save his daughter grief. I love the contrasts in Miller, too, and seeing her solve murders with a brilliant tenacity while she flaps along in a bright orange coat pushing a baby stroller is absolutely one of my favorite things about the show. 

I definitely ship Hardy/Miller, but gen about either one of them would be fantastic, too. What I like about them both are their relationships with their kids, their shared devotion to their job, and the confrontational and slightly off-kilter ways they have of interacting with the world.

Reed/Sue is easily one of my favorite Marvel ships, and I'd really like to see them get more love, but gen about either of them, about Valeria, or about the family as a whole would also really delight me. I'm definitely a big fan of the cosmic exploration angle and don't mind at all if you'd like to go more conceptual with the story. I'm most familiar with the more modern incarnation of the team and prefer those characterizations, although I'm (slowly!) working my way through the earlier comics, too. Favorite sources include Hickman (all the way through Secret Wars), the "Mythos" origin story, and basically every panel ever with Valeria and Doom interacting.

My feelings about this movie are the /worst/ but I would be totally happy with either gen about Kate (or Alejandro) (or Kate and Alejandro) or with whatever dark take you want to spin on a let's say less-than-platonic relationship. The spare cinematography really appealed to me, too, especially as a backdrop for such an intense story. Pre-canon, post-canon, or fill-in-the-gap fic would all be equally great! I would even take an AU, if that's your thing - more details on that in my letter. My main preference is that Kate remains the core, driving character, or (if she is shuffled to the side in a piece about Alejandro) that her competencies are demonstrated alongside her weaknesses.

Or Three and his delightful affection for Five, his willingness to get himself left behind for people, how terribly strange it is interacting with computer!Sarah (especially when she knows Marcus Boone better than she knows Three, in some ways). Or Two! By which I mean Two or Rebecca or Portia, of course—anything from any part of Two's backstory would be wonderful, or her present; how much she cares about the crew, how much it hurts to lose them or come close to it (One, Four, Six, Nyx ...), the peculiarities of being synthetic.

Vicious - V. E. Schwab 
Victor Vale, Eli Cardale | Eli Ever

I really enjoyed this book, and I love how deeply dysfunctional the relationship between Victor and Eli is, and how obsessed they are with each other. A large part of what I enjoy about them is that despite how much they hate each other, they're clearly the most important person in each other's life (in a pretty messed up way, sure, but still).

I'd love to see some one-on-one time between the both of them. Maybe a canon divergent AU where Victor succeeds in capturing Eli by himself, and makes the most of the fact that no matter how much he hurts him, Eli just keeps healing himself. 

Or maybe Victor remains dead after the events at the end of the book and comes back as a ghost to haunt Eli (which considering Eli could conceivably live forever, could go on for quite a long time). Maybe he's really a ghost, maybe he's just a product of Eli's imagination. I could see it go either way. 

These are just a couple of ideas, but I'm open to anything, really, though I would really like their relationship to remain antagonistic.

Fame (1980)

Greek (TV) 
Cappie (Greek), Casey Cartwright, Evan Chambers

Threesome with a heavy dose of past Evan/Cappie.  I've always held the opinion that Evan and Cappie were something to each other prior to going to college and that informed all their later behaviours.  So a story dealing with that would be really cool.  Also, Casey is so fundamental to their relationship in the present, I would like to see how she gets reconciled into their relationship.  Or whatever you like :)

Harlots (TV) 
Prince Rasselas (Harlots), Violet Cross, Amelia Scanwell

I'd love something involving Prince Rasselas. Maybe him hanging out with Violet and Amelia, or spending time with his boyfriend, or even a bit of backstory about when he first met his boyfriend/ came to London. It could even be him helping Violet and Amelia to find a private place and time to meet (because I think Violet and Amelia have the sweetest relationship) or any other plot idea you can think of for them. I don't mind how much (or little) slash is included, all I ask is that it has a happy ending and we get to see some more of these wonderful characters interacting with each other :)

Taboo (TV 2017) 
Michael Godfrey

Another story for Godfrey would be grand, and I'd prefer if it was slashy and salacious, or light and funny, rather than angsty and miserable. Just give the boy a good time - whether it's a past memory of something that happened in the Molly House, or a future day on the boat, or even a brief moment of happiness during the events of the series. I don't mind who he is paired with, or what he gets up to (my only real squicks are blood and scat if you go down the slashy route, anything else is fine).

I would like a story where, somewhere along the line, Geoffrey Chaucer gets hit. I love the character dearly, but it is surprisingly entertaining watching him being knocked around. I don't mind whether Wat is the one hitting him, or the one saving him, or the one watching with mild amusement. I don't mind whether slash is involved or not, so long as it is consensual. Just give Chaucer a slap at some point and I'll be happy :p

Amnesia: The Dark Descent 
Daniel (Amnesia), Justine Florbelle

One idea that’s been occupying my brain for years is Daniel interacting with Justine. Going by the game’s timeline, it is very possible for these two to meet. One specific prompt I have is for an older Daniel, who’s escaped Brennenburg, to have met up with Justine in France, once he’s become a lead in his Archeology field. I’m very interested in seeing these two in a bad/wrong ship, with both of their grievous sins coming to a head. (Justine seems perfectly fine with what she’s done, while Daniel is wracked by guilt, enough for self-induced amnesia). I’d love to see them relate to one another, and see where their darkness goes. Considering the subject of this game, I am more open to concepts of torture or non-con, or just any general terribleness. You are also free to portray them as platonic just as well! Just for this request, I’d like fluff/happiness to be as minimal as possible – as this is a canon where I see very little of that.

Super optional request!:  I am also open to crossovers for other Frictional games. Both Penumbra and SOMA have very similar elements and protagonists, and either through weird magic or just general past/present explanations, I’d love to see a story where these canons intersect.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
Mipha (Legend of Zelda), Link (LoZ: Breath of the Wild), Urbosa (Legend of Zelda), Revali (Legend of Zelda)

Been a fan of Legend of Zelda for many years and this new addition didn’t disappoint. However, I really wanted to learn more about the characters, and so I’m hoping for some more in-depth backstory characters such as Mipha, especially in regards to her relationship with Link. It seems they grew up together, so how did that mesh with their different ways of life? Did Link live with the Zora? How did their relationship to each other change once he became Zelda’s knight? Can definitely be written as a ship, and am also intrigued with a smut-leaning if you want to go in that direction.

I would also love to see more into earlier beginnings with Revali, and Daruk, and Urbosa. Including Mipha, I’d like to see how all these great heroes of their peoples worked together, and if there was any general misunderstandings or difficulties, and how they overcame them. An exploration into their deaths is also something intriguing. Of course, you can just mix and match which characters can interact as well! (I could not fit in Daruk as a requested character, so feel free to skip him if you'd like). I’d also be ecstatic to see a bit more worldbuilding explored for this canon – it was amazing to see that in the game, and having more details to just see the world and history that connects with previous LoZ canons would be great to read and learn about.

American Gods (TV) 
Mr. Wednesday (American Gods (TV)), Essie MacGowan (American Gods (TV)), Mad Sweeney (American Gods (TV))

The show has done such a unique job of representing many of the god characters, both old and new, and some of their backstories as well. I’d love to see someone’s take on Mr. Wednesday, perhaps more from when he was first brought to America and his general perception of it, as well as his own initial interactions with other gods/deities, such as Easter or Mad Sweeney, and how he came to be how he is. Any expansions on mythology and the like, general talk about different pantheons and religions, and utilizing the god characters as perhaps as just a concept for something else – I am very open to various interpretations of the show and all the characters.

For something perhaps a bit more grounded, a look into Essie MacGowan and Mad Sweeney is also ideal. I wanted more interactions between them, and maybe something like that could be alluded to in their past together, or a more introspective look into Mad Sweeney’s connection to her. Can be romantic, platonic, or somewhere in between!

Humans (TV) 
Leo Elster, Mattie Hawkins, Hester (Humans)

I would love any exploration of Leo/Hester and/or Leo/Mattie. I love all three of those characters and find the relationship dynamics fascinating.Please note: there is no need to include all three of the characters in the fic. You can also include any other characters from the show.

Possible prompts:
--Explicit fic of Hester and Leo having sex. Any dynamic of coercion, exploration, pleasure or pain would be more than fine. I imagine Leo is sort of interested and willing but naive, and I can see Hester being either more sadistic or kinky than he could ever have realized, or oddly kinder to him when they’re having sex.
--Mattie thinking about Leo being with Hester (sexually or otherwise)
--Mattie and Leo talking (or kissing or whatever) after Hester is gone, or maybe even just while she’s away somewhere. It could be after the events of S2, and we can just assume Leo gets fixed and is back to (his) normal. ;)

Merlin and Arthur are my OTP of OTPs, but I am also a huge sucker for Brolin.I have been following these guys for years &amp; years and appreciate any fic that is really informed about who they are (as much as we can tell), things they've done, etc. Ending can be anything--open-ended, HEA, bittersweet, unhappy. Whatever seems to fit them and your story.

Possible prompts:
--anything around Bradley going to see Gloria (either time or both times. He was there for the press night and for the closing, just before he left for Italy to start filming the Medici).
--texts between those two as their careers have progressed beyond Merlin
--early on flirtation/first time kissing/late-night hotel-room high-jinks
--anything giving us insight into Bradley’s career and life decisions over the last year. (It seems like he's moved back to the UK, is more open to jobs that aren’t Hollywood or America-based.)
--I'm really happy with ANYTHING, as long as it's true to their personalities, as far as we can know them from interviews, cast diaries, etc.

iZombie (TV) 
Liv Moore (iZombie TV), Ravi Chakrabarti (iZombie TV), Lowell Tracey (iZombie TV)

I love this show a ton, particularly Liv and Ravi as characters and in their interactions. I loved Lowell as Liv’s British rocker zombie boyfriend, and I loved the scenes where Ravi and Lowell would do sort of London footie banter and the like.

Possible prompts:
--Any fic that would involve Ravi, Liv, and Lowell--could be just the three of them chatting in the morgue, they could be out somewhere case-related, could be something where Liv talks to one of them, then the other (about a cure, or sex, or a common brain they’re on, or whatever).
--I thought it would have been PERFECT if Lowell had been around to be on that frat-boy party brain with Liv in episode 2.02, “Zombie Bro.” I’d love a fic that just explores the stupid fun they would have had at that party.
--Liv eats one of those brains that makes her super horny, and Ravi calls Lowell to get him to “deal” with her.
--Ravi has been keeping Lowell’s body in a drawer at the morgue this whole time, waiting for the day he could figure out how to bring him back. He does, and Liv now has to figure out where he fits into her life. (Could be set whenever with whatever going on with her. I’m fine with Liv/Major or any other relationship being part of the fic.)

The Folk Keeper - Franny Billingsley 
Corinna Stonewall, Finian Hawthorne

I adore the world of this slim story. Like, I love, love, love how Billingsley uses festivals, feast days, um British/Irish/Scottish folklore and superstitions, and folk customs that mark the passage of the year to frame Corinna’s story. (I’m such a dork for studying festivals and folk customs anyway, so Billingsley drawing on these traditions to make a kinda 17th or 18th century-esque fantasy world is like catnip for me. Like, oh my gosh, the Midsummer bonfire in this story and the throwing of the peats! Ah!!) I also love how much potential there is to explore gender identity and expression in writing fic about Corinna. Corinna as Corin can be so wonderfully snippy, vengeful, and wary - and then she has these moments of wonder and fondness as she discovers her love for the ocean, sailing, and Finian - or delights in her hard won knowledge and abilities. At the end of the book, the focus is so much on whether she’s going to go to sea as a seal maiden or stay with Finian and Lady Alicia, whether she’s going to give up words and language or keep them, that her transformation from Corin with his folk bag to Corinna in layers of petticoats is less explored. Toward the end, she says, “It never ends, this business of being a lady,” and I am so curious about how that plays out in her future. I would be  interested in any kind of story that examines how Corinna reconciles her Corin-self and possible Corinna-self after the ending of the novel. If the idea is of any interest to you, dear writer, I would be over the moon for a genderqueer Corin/na (I mean, genderqueer in our modern terms :)) dressed like a young lord or fisherman, working on boats with Finian - and a Finian who tries to figure out his attraction to the Corinna he knew as Corin and the person Corinna’s becoming now. If gender themes don’t interest you, dear writer, I know I would be pleased as anything to read more about Corinna and Finian’s romance or their life and adventures at Marblehaugh Park after the events of the novel. Or if you are drawn to write into some other part of the storyline, that’d be cool too. This book is such a treasure; if you love it too, I know I’ll totally enjoy whatever you’re moved to write based on it. :)

Everything I Never Told You - Celeste Ng 
Jack Wolff (Everything I Never Told You), Nath Lee (Everything I Never Told You)

Oh my goodness, Jack and Nath! Jack and Nath. How much do I love them, ahh. So, I wrote a story for this novel last Yuletide and had the pleasure of really delving into the 1970s Midwest setting and the characters, Jack in particular. The experience left me hungry to read more about them! I would love to see more fic for this ship, for this story; if you’ve matched me for this book, dear writer, I am just so excited to read your ideas, your characterizations, the themes you connect to in Everything I Never Told You. Here’s a bit about what draws me to the novel: the way the book deals with grief and how people move through it/around in it, the exploration of the racism Nath faces, the themes about alienation and the struggle for connection within families. I’m totally down to read about Jack and Nath getting together, making it work - how Nath realizes he has feelings for Jack - how Jack finally confesses his feelings for Nath, that sort of thing. It’d be rad to read a story set when they’re in college, where they visit each other in college and get together - or try to figure out how to keep a spark they discovered before they left home going in this new phase of their lives/amidst new geographies. I bet late 70s/early 80s Harvard would be super interesting. I’d also be really fascinated by a modern AU or probably any kind of fun AU. (I’m such a sucker for AUs. :D) Can't wait to read what you dream up! :)

The Book of Salt - Monique Truong 
Binh (The Book of Salt), Bao (The Book of Salt)

Ooh, dang, so if you’ve matched me for this book, dear writer, BLESS. I will sincerely be happy with whatever your heart draws you to explore here, I am pretty certain. Um, I love Binh - how wry, self-deprecating, yearning, and funny he is. I read this book years ago and then reread it this past year, and oh, I had forgotten how charming Binh is, even when his humor and outlook on life are also heartbreaking. I’m moved by his drinking, his cutting, and his incredible observations about class and the nature of working for others, doing something so intimate as preparing their food. And you know, of course, the book is so lyrical and devastating, with all Binh’s thoughts about belonging, home, exile, and the warmth of fleeting embraces and encounters. Oh my goodness, okay, in terms of prompts, if I had to pick one dynamic to focus on...the wish of my heart is for a deeper exploration of Binh's relationship with Bao. Like, I love the setting of the ship, the tiny room with its bunks that they share, the fact that they’re at sea, which is a world in and of itself, a world apart from the world. I love their relationship, which Binh reveals to us bit by bit - Bao’s tall tales, his advice about hiding oneself, the way they both hide themselves and also give themselves to each other. (And don’t even get me started about the revelation about their names, ahhh!) Would I be oh so down for some hot feelingsy smut from their time at sea together? Oh yes, yes I would. If you are a looking-forward sort of person who wants to write a happier ending for Binh where he meets Bao again, would I be down for that? Yes, yes. Binh’s brief relationship and continued fascination with the man on the bridge is also really interesting, and I’d be down to read a further exploration of that. I didn’t request him or Lattimore but just as the novel weaves together Binh’s experiences with each of them, I’d be down to read a story where Binh still thinks about or encounters any of these lovers. I just…I don’t know, I love him with Bao the most, and I’m most curious about how he and Bao lived together, what they found in each other - even how they might find each other again. But seriously, if you’ve matched me for this book, I’m just super excited to see what makes you passionate about it and what elements of it you’re moved to write about. :)

This show has been the biggest surprise of the year for me. I went in expecting Family Guy in Space, but instead was given sincere, fun old school Trek-like sci-fi. And I love the insecurities these two must have, despite their obvious strengths. Ed is captain of the Orville, but had a year where he totally went off the deep end and has zero experience helming a ship before. Alara is has more physical strength than anyone on the Orville, but she's also one of the youngest and least experienced on the crew.

I'm only requesting Alara and Ed, but feel free to throw in any of the crew. I love all of them! This canon is currently airing, and I have zero idea what to expect. Feel free to go with an idea that comes up based on future episodes!

Space: 1999 
Tony Verdeschi, Maya (Space: 1999)

This is my "someday my fic will come" request.  I've asked for it every Yuletide I've signed up for, and I haven't gotten it yet, but I still want it!

I love Tony and Maya. I love them separately as characters, and I love them together as a "you say you're not in love but we know you really are" couple. I'm not a big shipper, but this is the big exception -- I think they eventually married each other and lived happily ever after. So if you like to write shippy stories, go for it! (Please no explicit sex, though -- G or PG rating would be great.) On the other hand, I also think it took them a long time to get there, so a story that doesn't focus on them as a couple works, too -- I love genfic, and I'm primarily a gen writer myself. Some ideas: Tony and Maya's first meeting; Moonbase Alpha coming across something from Psychon civilization; or maybe a missing scene or a tag around one or more broadcast episodes? Really, just feel free to explore whatever you find interesting about these characters.

If you want some inspiration, see this shippy fanvid, which shows off all the wonderful '70s cheesiness of Maya's transformations to boot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8acdNWKk0b0

The Good Place (TV) 
Real Eleanor Shellstrop | Vicki

I love this show for how innovative it is, and how it is constantly surprising me with where it goes.   I also adore all the characters, but it's Vicky that I particularly want to read about.   She's a diva demon!  What was her life like in The Bad Place?   Did she feel that she got the respect she deserved there?  (I'm guessing no . . . )  How did Michael talk her into joining his scheme?   Has she ever been to Earth, and if so, what did she do there?   

I will be keeping up with canon, so don't worry about spoilers.  Also, don't worry if something crazy happens over the next few months that completely josses your fic.   (I mean, imagine if you'd started writing about Real Eleanor last season?)  I'd prefer it if you can keep the same tone as the canon; while passing mentions of physical torture are fine, please don't dwell on the details, or get too dark.   Crack!fic is welcome if your muse wants to go there.  Feel free to bring in other characters if you like as long as the focus remains on Vicky.  (P.S. -- whoever created this AO3 tag spelled her name "Vicki," but I think it's officially spelled "Vicky."  But I don't have a strong preference on the spelling, so you can choose.)

I adore Gita, and there's just not that much fic with her, so even though I've received wonderful fic about Gita in past Yuletides, I am requesting her again.   I love that she's bubbly, and earnest, and incredibly kind, and slightly irritating.    What if there's a situation where everyone has to prevent Gita from finding out about aliens?  Or what if she unknowingly saves the world from an alien menace?  Or what if she found out about aliens (again), and wanted to try to make money off them?   Or what if she's known about aliens the whole time, and she's been keeping secrets about them from Sarah and the others?  Or write anything else you like about Gita.  Appearances by others from SJA or from the wider Whoniverse are welcome but not required.

Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (1969) 
Marty Hopkirk

This show is a nostalgic favorite of mine.  I asked for Marty because to me Marty is what makes this show -- how he's a ghost but forgets sometimes, how he still has this great relationship with Jeff, how he's nervous and neurotic (especially about other ghosts), and how he's actually surprisingly smart and a good detective. Feel free to write about just him, or bring in Jeff and/or Jeannie.  I'd love some genfic here, in the vein of an unbroadcast story, but if you really like shipping then some Marty/Jeannie would be nice -- however I do see Marty as faithful to his widow, so please don't pair him with anyone else. If you want some ideas to start you off, how about: Marty on Halloween; Marty and Jeff have a fight about who's the better detective; or Jeff has to somehow rescue Marty (for a change).

Non-con, dubcon, pregnancy, incest, children (any children, don’t want to see ‘em, don’t want to hear about ‘em), queerphobia, Alpha/Omega. No gun use by the heroes. Nothing explicitly supernatural. Absolutely no Sam. Please don’t ship Mac with Pete; everybody else is fair game for romance. 

I'm not looking for crossovers, having been burned on too many Stargate fics that lug in my beloved character just for a joke about duct tape. Not that I have anything against jokes about duct tape! Quite the contrary.

(Although if you are that inexplicable person who agrees with me that the MacGyver characters would map amazingly onto John Le Carre's Karla trilogy, do feel free to write that.)

Dislike:

Feel free to include hanky-panky if that floats your boat, but honestly, I’m just not that interested in the finer details of plumbing. Fade to black is my preferred style.

Things I’d like to see:

Mac, of course. And I'd prefer at least one other person from the show. There’s this idea that MacGyver’s a heroic loner, and I’ve never agreed with that; even in episodes without the other regulars, he’s always friendly and looking for someone to bond with.

That’s it. I’d hate to dissuade any possible MacGyver fanfiction on the grounds of being too specific.

Sort the songs into proper chronological order, tell the bits of narrative that come in between, and bob’s your uncle!

Extra points if you agree with me that it’s set in some kind of Moorcock/Zardoz end-of-time kind of deal, because that’s the vibe I get from it.

19th Century CE Danish Literature RPF 
Hans Christian Andersen (19th Century CE Danish Literature RPF)

MY AWKWARD LOVE, Andersen. He's a desperate wretched mess. I love him. I'll flail for nine straight hours about my feelings for him if anyone's willing to listen, but I'll spare you most of it here. Short version: I wish he'd lived in a kinder time that allowed him to be happier, but I'm glad he had at least a few little chances at happiness even though they didn't last. Please write me anything you've got in you to write for him, I will love it. Anything about the autobiographical nature of a lot of his stories. Anything about his dirty diary full of black crosses and his difficult feelings regarding sex. Anything you want.

ODAO extra characters I wanted to nominate but couldn't figure out how to corral into a single sensible fandom name, if any of these relationships appeal:

Harald Scharff: handsome principal ballet dancer with the Royal Danish Theatre. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Scharff">his Wikipedia page</a>:

&nbsp;

  <i>In his diary entry for 2 January 1862, Andersen noted that Scharff "bounded up to me; threw himself round my neck and kissed me!" In other entries for January 1862, he described Scharff as "deeply devoted… very intimate… ardent and loving". In February, the poet observed that Scharff was "intimate and communicative" and in March he noted "a visit from Scharff... exchanged with him all the little secrets of the heart; I long for him daily." Later in March he wrote, "Scharff very loving... I gave him my picture." Scharff gave a silver toothbrush engraved with his name and the date to Andersen on his 57th birthday. In the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered a full-blown love affair that brought Andersen "joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness." He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary for March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his "erotic period".</i>

&nbsp;

Big age difference, affectionate lovers, and a handsome ballet dancer. It is everything I love. Andersen's story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman_(fairy_tale)">The Snowman</a> is supposedly about his pining for Scharff.

Jenny Lind: opera singer Andersen became infatuated with and proposed to. From Wikipedia:

&nbsp;

  <i>One of his stories, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightingale_(fairy_tale)">The Nightingale</a>", was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and became the inspiration for her nickname, the "Swedish Nightingale". Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: "farewell ... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny".</i>

&nbsp;

Charles Dickens: Andersen was a big fan of Dickens (after their first meeting he wrote in his diary "I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most") and they became friends, but then OOPS disaster a decade later when Dickens invited Andersen to stay at his home for a short while and Andersen just kind of missed/ignored all the hints that he should leave for five endless weeks. When he finally went home, Dickens totally ghosted him and poor old Andersen couldn't understand why his letters weren't being answered any more. <a href="http://the-toast.net/2014/10/01/dirtbag-hans-christian-andersen-2">This is my favourite account of that outstayed welcome</a>, but it would be great to see something slightly less flippant. Bonus points for showing Dickens getting really aggravated by it all, because I don't like Dickens :P

DNW: Andersen-bashing of any kind. I know he was often peculiar and annoying and didn't really have a brilliant understanding of when people were done with him getting in their way, but that's really not what I'd like to read about unless it's done with a bit of compassion. (Subjective, I know - anon commenting is allowed on my DW if you've got any questions.)

I don't even know where to begin. I would love to read ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING about any of these guys in whatever combination and setting you want.

Something about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/10061574/The-Rite-of-Spring-1913-Why-did-it-provoke-a-riot.html">the Paris riot</a>? <i>The conductor of the premiere, Pierre Monteux, was told by one of his double-bass players that "many a gentleman's shiny top hat or soft fedora was ignominiously pulled down by an opponent over his eyes and ears, and canes were brandished like menacing implements of combat all over the theatre"</i> is just the best and most beautiful report of a riot imaginable. This whole thing is a bit ridiculous and a lot fascinating and weirdly thrilling. Why don't we get riots over ballet and classical music any more? (Note: I know the stories about that night are all exaggerated to hell, but I don't care - go as ott or as realistic as you like. Legend and truth are both as good as each other sometimes.)

Or something more focused on the music and dance with Stravinsky and/or Nijinsky, and the sort of symbiosis of creator/performer needed to make all these glorious things possible. Or the physical difficulties of ballet... I would happily read a 1000 word intricately detailed description of a single leap or turn if that's what you wanted to write. Or something about the changing state of politics and society and fashions at the time they were all working. Diaghilev's background, like his love of music and how he wasn't good enough to make a career of it - how much lingering frustration was there about all that? How did it affect the work he ended up doing later in the theatre, or his relationship with brilliant Stravinsky? Diaghilev and Nijinsky were lovers, how did that come about? They didn't stay happy, but were they happy for a while? Or was their relationship purely physical?

DNW: focus on Nijinsky's deteriorating mental health, if you're writing about him. Of course don't avoid the topic completely if you want to include it, just please don't have that as the main focus and please nothing about his time in asylums. (Recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/831382.The_Diary_of_Vaslav_Nijinsky">The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky</a>, but it's incredibly upsetting and difficult to read.)

Elsie Wright (Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF), Frances Griffiths (Cottingley Fairies Hoax RPF)

I don't know why I've never thought of Cottingley Fairies fic before but w o w it's lodged in my head and there's no shifting it now! I've loved this story my entire life. I would love to see anything at all about Elsie and Frances learning about photography, their games, what made them pretend it was all real, how they felt when it all took off and ran away with itself - were they scared about being found out? Just elated that they had such a wonderful secret? Lots of things all at once? Early photography and film is a HUGE passion of mine and I feel a bit silly and reverant about it all, I don't like the tendency to get a bit ha-ha about people being taken in by something that seems so sweetly ridiculous now (even though yes there's absolutely something glorious about a couple of little girls fooling some of the best minds of the era for so long). I'm fascinated by this weird liminal time of people still figuring out this relatively new technology and what to feel about it all. I'm sure I would have been taken in as well. I WANT TO BELIEVE. Anyway - fairy hoax, children's games, young girls fooling smart old men, this sense of inexplicable magic coming to life on glass plates, secrets, I am here for any of it. I didn't add Arthur Conan Doyle to my requests because I'm mostly interested in the girls' stories, but absolutely do include him if you like.

Another angle - what if the pictures actually weren't a hoax? Elsie and Frances find real live fairies at the bottom of their garden and take their pictures... what then? Are they nice Disney type fairies who just want to play? Or are they the kind of fairies who demand payment for anything you take from them? Fairy stories always scared the hell out of me way more than ghosts and monsters so it would be great to read some kind of fairytale-horror take on all of this, especially because the pictures are so incredibly lovely. Turn the whole thing upside down.

Kingsman (Movies) RPF 

I was going to narrow this down to just Mark/Colin, but I've been having so much fun with the Golden Circle press tour interviews and I'm kind of in love with all of them. Some ideas below, but feel free to mix and match anyone from the tagset if you prefer.

Potential pairings, &amp; and / both welcome:

* Mark/Colin is the big one with the most history to mine, but really any combination of Colin &amp; Mark &amp; Taron is GOLD (especially with Mark's comments about Harry, Merlin &amp; Eggsy being a family). Mark and Colin working together so often. That thing Mark said about seeing Colin on stage in Another Country and how it made him want to act. Some kind of conversation between reading the script and shooting about whether Harry/Merlin is a real thing, or teasing about why the hell Colin decided to play Harry with such ridiculous bedroom eyes all the damn time. Colin and Mark and the crossover between mentors and friends to Taron. Taron's mum fancying Mark and Colin getting fake-pissy about it. Colin trying on Elton John's costume and the others taking blackmail photos. Anything from friendship to the most explicit filth, please and thank you.
* Taron/Channing and the sex toys prank war, what was that all about? Was anyone else in on it or a victim of it? I love Channing's excitement about all of this and how open he is about being a huge fanboy of the first film. A big lovefest of "I LOVE KINGSMAN" - "OK BUT I LOVE HAIL CAESAR SO MUCH" - "YEAH BUT YOU'RE ELTON JOHN NOW" - "I KNOW BUT YOU WERE SO GOOD IN FOXCATCHER AND THE EAGLE IS AMAZING AND I MADE COLIN WATCH STEP UP AND HE LOVED IT" - "WOW OK THANKS" mutual fanboying would be beautiful.
* Colin/Channing for absolutely no reason other than the idea of it makes me very happy. Ships have sailed on much less.
* Sophie/Sofia mmmaybe getting salty together about the big Boys' Club/sausage fest these sets must have been (I genuinely love these films, but let's be real)
* Pedro/Halle because they were a total delight in every interview together and hearts came streaming out of my eyes.
* Taron/Colin/Pedro since Taron keeps insisting on talking about that jealousy photo in every single interview.

Or mix it up! I have no real strict (friend)ship affiliation, so if you want to throw your favourites together and see what happens I'll honestly love anything at all. I will be surfing this goodwill wave for years yet, I adore this entire bunch and just really enjoy seeing people's takes on them.

(DNW: wife and girlfriend bashing if there's romance/smut, please just go with happy polyamory.)

Mongol Empire RPF 
Khutulun (Mongol Empire RPF)

I only have one real prompt, and <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/wrestler-princess">this article in Lapham's Quarterly</a> explains it better than I can:

"With her success in battle and in sports, Khutulun refused to marry unless a man could first defeat her in wrestling. Many men came forward to try, but none succeeded. Her parents became anxious for her to marry. According to Marco Polo, a particularly desirable bachelor prince presented himself around 1280. Most opponents wagered ten horses, or at the most a hundred, to compete against her. This unnamed bachelor wagered a thousand horses, and Khutulun's parents pleaded with her to take a fall and let him win.

An excited crowd gathered for the match. In the desire to please her parents Khutulun agreed to let the prince win. In the rush of competitive excitement as she stepped forward to face her rival, however, her filial resolve to please her parents melted. She grabbed her opponent by the arms, and found him to be more formidable than her usual challengers. He struggled against her, and they pushed this way and that, but she could not submit and allow herself to be thrown. The match continued for an agonizing long time with neither able to dominate. Finally, in a great surge of energy Khutlun threw him to the ground. She not only defeated but humiliated him, and he disappeared, leaving behind the additional thousand horses for her herd but having shattered her parents' hopes of marrying her to a worthy suitor."

I just really really want to hear more about this strong brilliant defiant warrior princess and the billion horses she won from all the humiliated suitors she crushed in wrestling matches. This is the greatest thing. I'd love to read more about her in war and her place in her family as well, any kind of story you want because there's not a great deal of information out there and she's endlessly fascinating - but "horse hoarding wrestling champ" is absolutely my favourite part.

Effie Gray (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Elizabeth Siddal (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Jane Morris (Pre-Raphaelite RPF), Marie Spartali Stillman (Pre-Raphaelite RPF)

I remember being so fascinated when I was little by how I could recognise the same faces over and over in different paintings, and it grew into a bit of an obsession with artists' models, particularly the women in so much of the Pre-Raphaelite art. When I started reading up on them it all shifted from the initial "Alexa is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life omg" to wanting to know everything about them and their wishes and achievements and everything else, rather than only knowing them from the way their lives slotted into the guys'. They're famous worldwide nearly to the point of being mythical (Lizzie's hair growing after death to fill her coffin!) but it's shallow, it's almost entirely because of their beauty. There must be millions of people who could recognise their faces but don't know their names. There's so much more to explore. I would honestly love to read anything about any of them so if you've got a particular favourite and something you want to say about her then please do, but some possible starting off points:

* Marie Spartali Stillman and Lizzie Siddal as artists. The whole act of creation and the drive behind it. Lizzie's much less idealised self-portraits vs other people's portraits of her.
* How completely Jane reinvented herself as soon as she had the means.
* Effie's determination and courage during the mess of her marriage annulment. Her maternal sort of relationship with Sophy.
* I seriously cannot overstate how obsessed I am with long hair. I would be absolutely ok with just a 1000 word description of someone washing or brushing this thigh-length mass of beautiful endless curls. SWOON.
* The strange dichotomy of being a dressmaker or charwoman or whatever but seeing your face in these gloriously beautiful celebrated paintings. How seeing that changes your perspective on everyday life, if it does at all.
* Artist modelling being only half a step up from prostitution. Does that make anyone's decision to do it more difficult, or does it change anything for them outside of the studio? Some of them married famous artists and/or came from higher class families, but Alexa, Fanny C, and Fanny E were all working class women, and Fanny E was Jamaican. How different was it for them vs Marie or the Grays?

* Or go totally off in some other AU direction if that's your thing and include the whole group. Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies this up, or put them in the middle of the Martians attack from The War of the Worlds, or make them meet Dracula. Shove them all together in a house and see what happens. Would they be friends? Or something about the characters from the paintings, instead of the women themselves. Anything!

DNW: a primary focus on Rossetti/Millais/etc with the women added in around the edges, I really want the women to be the centre of it in whatever way that is (but absolutely include anyone you like around them). And mentions are fine, but please not a whole thing solely about Sophy's anorexia.

Ahahaha, I watched all of this in one sitting last weekend, and I fell for it so hard. I! love! time! travel! stories! I also love the trio, and how they come to rely on one another. Maybe a story about another after-work social? How about their lives if they'd never intersected? Who would they be? What happens if Lucy gets her sister back? What is the show saying about fate, if anything? What are Garcia's feelings about Lucy? Why does he trust her? Her notebook? Why does Rufus trust any of them? What if he was the heir to Rittenhouse? 

Guys, I really love stories about time travel and the plurality of universes, so if you wanted to go off the deep-end - I mean, full-on multiverse, terminator-style, just go for it. I will not object at all.

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 
Ralph Lanyon, Laurie Odell

Things I tend to like: introspective character studies and backstories, complex and intense relationships, hurt/comfort, humor and clever dialogue (when appropriate), historical detail, characters undergoing some sort of emotional journey or transformation throughout the story, characters grappling with their feelings or with difficult situations, quiet expressions of intimacy or vulnerability. 

Things I'd prefer not to read: rape, crack/intentional OOC, major character deaths (unless they happened in canon), AUs (with the exception of canon-divergence/"what if" scenarios). 

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I would love a post-canon wartime story about these characters. I am interested in seeing how Ralph and Laurie's relationship progresses throughout the war and how they navigate challenges of wartime and being part of gay society, and how their attitudes, worldviews, and prejudices may evolve as well. Ralph particularly is such an incredibly compelling character to me, with all his innumerable facets and flaws, and anything that dives into his psyche or reveals something about his character or his past would also be wonderful to read. Feel free to incorporate additional characters, especially Alec or any of the Bridstow crowd.

My only hardline requests are 1) please no depressing endings (though moderate amounts of angst with a happy/hopeful ending is fine) and 2) don't break up Ralph and Laurie, or make either of them unfaithful to each other. I admit that I am a deeply hopeless romantic/optimist when it comes to these characters - not that I expect everything to be sunshine and roses for them, but I do want them to find some lasting degree of happiness and stability together, even if there might be some intermittent angst and conflict in their lives. 

Possible ideas:
- Ralph fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic. How has his self-image changed since being commissioned again and starting a relationship with Laurie? Or Ralph getting imprisoned in a POW camp and escaping somehow.
- Ralph and Laurie exchanging letters throughout the war (and couching their feelings in coded language).
- Laurie finding out something significant about Ralph's past - his childhood, family, previous relationships, whatever he did after school instead of going "straight to Southampton" (sex work tends to be a common theory, though ymmv of course), etc. Or Ralph is confronted by someone from his past, and he and Laurie have to deal with the consequences.
- This one I'll throw in for its comedic (and/or dramatic) potential: Ralph and Laurie running into Charles Fosticue (Laurie's ex-boyfriend from Oxford) at a party. (Possible opportunity for bitchy!Laurie and proprietary!Ralph?) Or any story about Ralph and Laurie brushing up against the rest of the Bridstow queer scene, and how its members perceive them as individuals and as a couple. (I've always wanted to know the gossips' reactions to Ralph throwing Bunny over for Laurie, and what are the "entre nous" rumors circulating about Ralph?)

Secret History - Donna Tartt 
Francis Abernathy, Henry Winter, Camilla Macaulay, Charles Macaulay

Things I tend to like: introspective character studies and backstories, complex and intense relationships, hurt/comfort, humor and clever dialogue (when appropriate), historical detail, characters undergoing some sort of emotional journey or transformation throughout the story, characters grappling with their feelings or with difficult situations, quiet expressions of intimacy or vulnerability. 

Things I'd prefer not to read: rape, crack/intentional OOC, major character deaths (unless they happened in canon), AUs (with the exception of canon-divergence/"what if" scenarios). 

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I'd like any story that explores the dynamics between these characters (horribly dysfunctional and codependent that they are). You can either include all of these characters or just focus on two or three if you wish. Of the four Francis is my favorite, so alternatively I'd take a character piece about him or his relationships. In terms of romantic pairings I tend to be interested in Francis/Charles, Francis/Henry, Henry/Camilla, or of course the quadrangle of Henry/Camilla/Charles/Francis, but I'd be fine with a gen/friendship story as well. I'd prefer not to have a story centered specifically around romantic Charles/Camilla, though I'm not asking you to ignore the incestuous aspect of their relationship (just not to focus completely on it).

My other main request is not to romanticize these characters overmuch (unlike Richard!) - I've always viewed them as fascinating, vulnerable but deeply selfish people who are probably not capable of having any sort of functional or healthy relationships, and yet are still somehow horridly attached to each other. For this fandom I am perfectly okay with angst, violence, darker interpretations, or unhappy/bittersweet endings, as befitting the tone of the novel (or lighter stories with an undercurrent of darkness that take place before everything utterly goes to shit). 

Possible ideas:
- What actually happened during the bacchanal. The novel leaves the somewhat mystical elements up to interpretation (did they really see Dionysus?), and of course there's Henry's infamous line about there being a "certain carnal element to the proceedings."
- An AU where the four of them successfully manage to flee the country, but their lives and relationships still deteriorate, albeit in different ways.
- Conversely, an AU where the murders are discovered (perhaps Julian turns them in?), and the fallout that ensues.
- A post-canon story with Francis, Charles, and Camilla meeting up years later, their lives by now greatly diverged, but unresolved feelings still linger.
- A pre-canon slice of life story, or a "missing moment" within the book.

Sorcerer to the Crown - Zen Cho 
Zacharias Wythe, Prunella Gentleman

Things I tend to like: introspective character studies and backstories, complex and intense relationships, hurt/comfort, humor and clever dialogue (when appropriate), historical detail, characters undergoing some sort of emotional journey or transformation throughout the story, characters grappling with their feelings or with difficult situations, quiet expressions of intimacy or vulnerability. 

Things I'd prefer not to read: rape, crack/intentional OOC, major character deaths (unless they happened in canon), AUs (with the exception of canon-divergence/"what if" scenarios). 

Sexual content: Not required, but feel free to include it if it fits the story. I'm fine with any level of explicitness, though I'd prefer a story with sex that places more of an emphasis on characterization/relationship dynamics to a straight-up PWP.

I don't have really any specifications for this one story-wise - this was such an utterly fun, clever book that so deftly handles racial and gender politics of the period, and I would happily read just about any story about the further magical adventures of these characters. I loved the Prunella/Zacharias romance in the book but I'd be content with a gen story about either character as well. 

Possible ideas:
- Prunella's career as Sorceress - either her nascent career, or several years onward.
- Zacharias continuing to pursue social reform efforts and Fighting The Establishment.
- Zacharias searches for his parents, and/or Prunella learns more about her mother.
- Prunella and Zacharias's wedding - or the wedding night.
- A crossover with the Jane Austen novel of your choice (perhaps taking place when Prunella is out trying to land a suitor and enter society?).

The Evil Within (Video Game) 
Sebastian Castellanos

I love all the chars and themes in TEW, from the gory and dark and angsty to more mundane day-to-day interactions of the characters pre or post game. Whether it's supernatural horror stuff or cop &amp; detective stuff, this game really has a lot of themes I love.
I like a lot of ships in this game, bonus points if Seb is always begrudgingly putting up with someone else's overtures.

My favorite ship is Sebastian/Tatiana, especially with Tatiana being pushy and forward to Sebastian trying to "help" and him being really awkward. If there is Joseph/Sebastian or Juli/Sebastian, I would prefer it one-sided AT Seb, with their feelings not being reciprocated or situations falling into non-con territory. Pining is great! Anything with Ruvik treating Seb as an object or toy in either a sexual or non context is wonderful. Hassling by the monsters is great (Keeper, Sadist). Or any number of chars thrown together with Seb, I'm not so picky. I love the upgrade chair and all that it entails. I also do enjoy Seb in his canon ship with his wife Myra, though I would prefer a story involving her to also include angst or detail about their falling out or the potential lies between them.

I love stuff with fighting and action, blood and angst. I also like ridiculous scenarios or funny or interesting character interactions that don't appear in canon. I also love detective work or mysterious stuff, day-to-day of the KCPD or even the monsters.

The sequel will release after the close of signups, and I have no idea what will be included in it. It is entirely fine to ignore the second game and its canon entirely, and focus on the first game. Or, if there are things in the second game that inspire or entertain, as long as they fall within my general preferences that's totally fine with me!
Possible ideas:
- Seb fighting for his life in STEM and against monsters to good or bad end
- Post-game, Seb unsure of his sanity or if the events of TEW occurred, falling into destructive habits
- Pre-game detective adventures with Seb and any of the KCPD characters
- A new case or adventure for Sebastian as KCPD or after being fired to embark upon or investigate

Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator 
Robert Small

Robert is my favorite in DDADDS, so anything with him featured would be great. I love his personality and entire aesthetic. I think he works well for dark stories, especially when trying to scoff off or make light of something actually disturbing or horrible.

The relationships I enjoy most are with Dadsona, Damien or Joseph. Robert/Joseph/Mary or even Robert/Mary would be fun too! Or if not shippy, just some straight up sad-dad failure at life kinda stuff.

Possible ideas:

- Robert searching for spooky things in the woods, getting hurt, getting scared, etc.

- Robert adventuring (or more) with Mary, the intense friendship they have regardless of Robert's sleeping with Joseph

- AU with actual vampire Damien and/or demon Joseph?

- Robert angsting about his estrangement from daughter Val, memories of their earlier years (however you headcanon)

Hatoful Kareshi | Hatoful Boyfriend 
Iwamine Shuu

I like Hatoful because although it's adorable on the surface, the bulk of the story is pretty dark. I like the contrast there a lot! Despite my best efforts, Shuu ended up my favorite, and I especially love the brutally dark ideas in his story. Considering it's all in canon: dark fic, gore, and character death are all fine. Delving into Shuu's sexual proclivities with an obsessive or dark bent is also totally fine, but not necessary.

Possible ideas:

- Shuu doing experiments in current time while thinking about interactions with Ryuuji (whether fluffy or dark)

- Shuu experimenting on or obsessing over Ryouta

- Shuu's experiences interacting with Hiyoko in the original endings, ultimately leading to her decapitation

- Shuu/Hiyoko's head in jar go on an adventure?

-Shuu interacting with any other cast members in a way that makes them uncomfortable or creeped

-A typical day in the life of Shuu?

"i love six of crows and the crooked kingdom, but i wasn’t super satisfied with some aspects of his character development, particularly in the crooked kingdoms. (note: this prompt contains spoilers for the crooked kingdom.) in particular, i wasn’t happy with the fact that his gambling addiction – a very real problem faced by millions of people – was given a supernatural explanation. i also wasn’t happy with how the solution in a crooked kingdom to his gambling addiction was “well wylan controls his money”. i’d love to see fic that really dealt with those aspects of his character. 

however, i understand that gambling addiction is a very serious issue and that a writer for a variety of reasons might not feel comfortable writing about those series. if this is the case – and as a writer you don’t want to pick a different fandom – i’ve also included some lighter, extra prompts. 

prompts: 

* modern AU: what would jesper look like in a modern universe, where he doesn’t have his grisha powers and addiction is understood as a disease? i’d love a fic that was set with him in rehab. he could already be in a relationship with wylan or meet wylan as part of his road to recovery. bonus points for if jesper’s parents play a large role in the narrative.
*  post-canon fic: in the end of six of crows, his situation with wylan is described as wylan gives him “some extra money to manage” and that he has started to invest money instead of gambling. this seems like it might be constraining for jesper, who is used to living alone and (mis)managing his own money. how does he respond to having so much money? how does investing compare to gambling for him? 

i understand that for any number of reasons prompts that touch on gambling and gambling addiction might not make a good prompt for yuletide. other lighter prompts: 

* jesper describes wylan as a prince who has found himself in the wrong story. i’d love a fairytale AU where wylan is a prince and jesper is a handsome thief / knight in shining armor / any other trope of your choosing.
* if you want something more porn-y, i really like the idea of jesper and wylan playing The Princess and the Barbarian. your choice for who is the princess and who is the barbarian (and they could switch!) 

&nbsp;

want: as much as i love wylan i'd love something that was more jesper-centric since i feel like his perspective on things got sortta short-changed at the end of the book; i'd love to see more of jesper's dad and his mom (if in an AU) 

prefer no: woobification of either jesper or wylan

Carry On - Rainbow Rowell 
Agatha Wellbelove

I'd really like a fic from Agatha's perspective set after the events of the book. How is she adjusting to life in California? How is she adjusting to life without magic? Something introspective and character-driven would be great. 

would like: anything that deals with her relationship with her family; any exploration of Agatha's sexuality (or lackthereof) - all headcanons for sexuality / romantic interests for Agatha are great 

prefer no: mentions of baz or simon are fine but i don't want thoughts of them to dominate the narrative

Oglaf (Webcomic) 
Greir (Oglaf), Navaan (Oglaf)

I really loved the interaction these two had when they needed to team up against the Fun God and how their contrasting styles somehow managed to combine to get results, and I would love to see more of that. Maybe the lesbian pirates steal something Greir was hired to guard and only Navaan can help her get it back, possibly with undercover-as-a-couple shenanigans that turn into something real. Or maybe Navaan is the one who steals the thing from Greir just because she wants to see what Greir will do to get it back. Or maybe Navaan needs Greir's help to escape villagers who are angry about the results of her fake doctor business. Or maybe instead of the usual fuck-or-die trope, Greir finds herself stuck in a have-fun-or-die situation and only Navaan has a chance of getting her to crack a smile. Or just give me lots of chasing and fighting and sexual tension that gets resolved with acrobatic kissing and inappropriate use of fake death pellets. Or Greir could introduce Navaan to the Snow Queen for some reason that made sense at the time but now seems like it may have been a really bad idea because Navaan has broken out her fruit viking seduction costume and there are frozen bananas everywhere. Or whatever else you can think of.

Feel free to include whatever other canon characters you want for supporting roles in the story or make up OCs. In terms of ships, I'd be equally happy with either gen or Greir/Navaan. Greir/Navaan/Snow Queen would be good too but is in no way expected or required.

Beat the Devil (1953) 
Gwendolen Chelm, Maria Dannreuther

These two have such an interesting relationship. They kind of start out scamming each other in their separate ways, and then in short order both want to steal each other's husbands, yet there never seems to be any enmity between them, and they might even be some sort of actual friends by the end of the movie. I would love to see any kind of missing scenes from the movie where it is just the two of them together, either wandering around town entertaining themselves while waiting for the ship to be ready, or when they think Dan is dead, or on the ship, or after they've been "shipwrecked" and taken into custody, or whenever. Gwendolen is prone to compulsive lying/making up stories, so what kind of stories does she make up about herself and Maria when they're alone? Or, what happens after the end of the movie? What happens after Harry sends for Gwendolen to join him in Africa? Does she go join him? Does Maria go join him? Do Gewndolen and Maria work out some kind of spouse swapping deal? Do they drag their husbands into some kind of poly relationship? Do they ditch the men and run off together as either friends or lovers? Dan and Harry have both been mistakenly thought to be dead, so do Gewndolen and/or Maria ever end up being mistaken for dead at some point in the future, either accidentally or on purpose?

Feel free to include whatever other canon characters you want or make up OCs for supporting roles in the story. Gen, femslash, or any het or poly combinations involving Gwendolen, Maria, Dan and/or Harry are equally fine.

Night at the Museum (Movies) 
Tilly (Night at the Museum)

I love Tilly and would love to see anything about what she was doing during the time-skip at the end of the movie or further into the future. How does she handle going from a boring job where she sits in a little booth all night to a job where she's dealing with magic and wonder and chaotic all night parties, all while officially she's still supposed to be sitting in that little booth all night? Is there any part of the museum that she especially loves or hates when it comes to life? What kind of fun or trouble does she have during the exhibits' world tour at the end of Secret of the Tomb? Does she keep in touch with Larry to get advice and/or complain about the latest magical shenanigans she has had to clean up after? Does Tilly ever talk Ahkmenrah and/or Lancelot into letting her have swords and teaching her how to use them? I ship Laaa/Tilly and would love to see a post-canon story about how they handled a relationship involving a language barrier and a species barrier. Bonus points for body-positivity and Laaa thinking that Tilly looks like a fertility goddess. Does Tilly ever get to celebrate any holidays with the exhibits, either in London, in New York, or anywhere else along the tour? Would the Tablet's powers do anything to a living person who was dressed up as somebody/something else, such as a person in a Halloween costume or dressed as Santa Claus or whatever, and how would Tilly deal with the results?

Feel free to include whatever other major or minor canon characters you want, whether they're in the tag set or not, because they're all entertaining, or make up OCs to fill supporting roles. As I said above, I ship Tilly/Laaa. Any ships between whatever supporting characters you decide to include are fine too as long as they aren't the main focus of the story.

Blood Drive (TV) 
Julian Slink, Grace d'Argento

Some of my favorite moments in canon are the interactions between Grace and Slink, especially times like the interrogation in "The Fucking Dead" and their whole time together in the bar in "Fistful of Blood" when Slink can't just brain-bomb shock Grace into submission, because they're both so driven to get what they want and are ready to break out the violence with little provocation, and there's no telling what they might do to each other or any bystanders. I love how they're just so opposed to each other both for legitimate and for very petty reasons and how, despite everything Slink has done, Grace isn't afraid of him and isn't even impressed.

Did they interact at all in the year between when Grace agreed to join the Blood Drive and when the main race takes place? Were there qualifying races Grace had to drive in before the main event? Did Slink just show up to annoy her from time to time to make sure his "hand-picked battle bitch" would be ready to put on a good show when the time came? I would also love to see missing scenes from any point in canon, maybe from the two hour time-skip between the beginning of their "twenty questions for twenty punches" game and Slink telling Grace that her life reads like a depressing country song, or Grace having to put up with Slink as a road trip companion between episodes 10+11 or 12+13. Or insert an extra leg of the race where they had to face another instance of random sci-fi/horror tropes like giant mutant insects, ghosts or other supernatural creatures, time loops, time travel, dealing with (un)natural disasters, or whatever else you can think of. I'd also love to see something post-canon where they both somehow survive, because of course they would have if the show had gotten a second season. If they met up again after destroying Heart Tower, how would their goals have shifted? Would they try even harder to kill each other because they don't have any reason to hold back anymore, or would they have enough built up grudging respect for each other to team up again to go rescue Arthur, or would their reactions be something else entirely?

Feel free to include whatever other major or minor canon characters you want, whether they're in the tag set or not, because they're all entertaining, or make up OCs to fill supporting roles. I'd prefer Grace and Slink's relationship remain gen, with no sex/romance. For potential background ships, I like Slink/Rasher, Grace/Arthur, Grace/Carolina, Grace/Domi, Aki/Christopher, Arthur/Christopher, and Domi/Cliff.

A few possible options here:

2. William Blore as Mr. Owen - Towards the end there is suspicion of Blore (especially concerning Armstrong's death) - and why couldn't he be Mr. Owen?  If you would like to have Vera working with him, that would be aces.

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

[Please could you avoid (please apply this list to all my requests - thanks!) mpreg, BDSM, A/B/O, soulmate AUs (and any variation along the identifying-marks line), any sort of non-canon supernatural AU, bodyswap, and animal cruelty, suffering, or endangerment of any kind. I'm fully up for explicit sex, but I'd rather not receive a PWP - I like a bit of dialogue and rambling stream-of-consciousness. As you'll see from my individual requests, I tend to prefer canon-era fics or ones which more or less fit into the existing universe, rather than modern-day AUs or other transpositions.] 

I'd really appreciate you sticking to canon-era for this fandom. I'd love to read more about their first meeting and how their working/personal relationship develops, or more about their reunion if you choose to give them one (character death okay in this fandom, as long as it's heavy on the angst, because I love to suffer). How do they get to know each other again post-war? Do they grow old together? I'd prefer their relationship to be romantic rather than platonic, even if they don't get round to consummating it or acknowledging it to each other. 

In this fandom, I particularly like: British stiff-upper-lipness/emotional constipation, the constant threat of mortality throwing ~feelings into sharp relief, coping with a noticeable age difference and with the gulf in their ranks, making the most of moments of peace, Tom Hardy-esque grunting, lots of rich historical detail, having to keep their relationship secret. I also love it when there's a dog of some description for Farrier to be affectionate towards.

Just one small personal preference in terms of style in this fandom: please avoid writing in Scots dialect when writing Collins' voice - I find it a bit distracting. Thank you!


Request 2 by dewinter
Pride (2014) 
Cliff (Pride)

I'd love to read more about Cliff's quiet exploration of his sexuality after attending Pride - doesn't need to be about finding a relationship necessarily; it could just be about finding like-minded people and the grief of finding them so late in life, and so far away. Alternatively, you could explore the trajectory of his life in the Dulais valley before the events of the movie - the death of his brother, his career in the pits, the pain of never quite fitting in, and the contrast between the shy bookish man and the screaming, passionate striker. The more Welsh-ness the better! Any and all other characters very welcome (especially Dai, Hefina, and Gethin!) but I'd love for the main focus to be Cliff.

Colditz (1972) 
Horst Mohn, Simon Carter

I'd really like to read a post-war fic in this fandom, which explores the aftermath of captivity, or of having been crowded together, jailers and prisoners cheek-by-jowl, for so long. Do the prisoners struggle with a sense of guilt at having been "out of it"? Do the jailers reevaluate their perspective or feel any remorse? 

I'd love to read a post-war encounter between Mohn and Carter which explores the strange dynamic between them. I don't mind whether you make Mohn's obsession with Simon sexual or not, but I'd rather it not be reciprocated if so. Or you could write a Simon post-war gen story: I'd love to read more about his reintegration into Cathy's family, and whether the tensions that were there before the war remain. And how does he deal with his lingering disability?

In the Flesh (TV) 
Rick Macy, Kieren Walker

I'd love to see any scenes in Rick and Kieren's friendship/relationship before canon - I'd rather not receive a story set after the Rising or containing any canon divergence AUs where Rick survives.

Things I'd like: teenage boys being both horny and emotionally constipated, abortive attempts to talk about feelings, lots of details about growing up in a small Lancashire town, dealing with parental surveillance and disapproval, Rick's internalised homophobia and struggle to reconcile his laddish reputation with his relationship with Kieren, discussion of plans for the future. Although I'd be fine with sexual intimacy, I'd like non-touching or almost-touching (and the accompanying yearning and sexual frustration) even more.


Request 5 by dewinter
Mercy Street (TV) 
Emma Green, Henry Hopkins

My greatest wish in this fandom is a post-war fic about their marriage which deals with Emma's ostracisation from her family, and her bumpy integration into whatever northern community you decide Henry's from. How does she deal with being a lowly chaplain's wife? How does she deal with the jealousy of northern girls who believe she's stolen Henry? How does she win the community over to the idea of having a southern belle in their midst? Or you could go in another direction - perhaps they move west to establish a church in a pioneer community, or they stay in the South doing Freedmen's Bureau-type work with emancipated people. As long as they are together and learning to be happy and in love. 

I'd love to see the importance and depth of Henry's faith to every part of his life (and maybe how the war has tested that faith), and to see him still dealing with the fallout of the murder he committed, and blaming any difficulties his new family encounters on himself. I'd also love to see him coming out of his shell a little, and Emma teaching him how to enjoy life a bit more with her natural vivacity. I also absolutely love awkward fumbling wedding-night encounters, please and thank you.


Request 6 by dewinter
Taboo (TV 2017) 
James Delaney, Michael Godfrey

I'd most like to read some Godfrey-centric fic in this fandom. Anything about his life at the seminary and the development of his hopeless/helpless love for James, about how the molly-house offers him a contingent sort of liberation (even a chance to explore what we would now call gender dysphoria?), about his conflicted feelings towards the EIC, about his life aboard the ship as he and the gang set sail for the Azores. 

Alternatively, I would also love to read a growing closeness between James and Godfrey - my personal headcanon is that James is straight, so I'd love a story where James falls for a Godfrey who's embraced his identity as a woman. I've used male pronouns throughout this request but please feel free to play around with that if you do end up exploring Godfrey's gender identity. 

I love: the contrast between James' arrogant chill and Godfrey's state of constant panic, James calling Godfrey "Godders", reminders of their shared adolescence, explorations of the fluidity and constructedness of gender, Godfrey's hero-worship of James, lots of detail about the feeling and materiality of clothing, and about the muck and grime of London or life aboard ship.

Penric kin Jurald, Desdemona (Chalion)

Okay so. Pen. And Desdemona. &lt;3____________&lt;3 It is really, really striking to me how much their story in Penric and the Demon is structured as a romance, and I would really, really love to read a further exploration of that. If you'd rather keep things non-explicit, I'd be delighted by more exploration of things Pen does to give gifts to Desdemona--and what it's like when Desdemona wants to do nice things for Pen in return.

If you're open to the sexy options, oh my god, SO MANY POSSIBILITIES?! Inevitably, there's a first time when Pen jerks off knowing he has Desdemona watching--does that become a gift of pleasure he gives her? Does she have advice for him on how to make it better? Does Desdemona coach him through his first time with a woman? Does he try having sex with a guy who Desdemona likes the looks of? And so on, and on, and on. I would love ANYTHING in that line, omfg.

Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Shawshank Redemption (1994)), Andy Dufresne (Shawshank Redemption (1994))

Oh God, I love this movie beyond ALL REASON, and Andy's hurt-and-recovery-and-triumph arc was (*looks at Bucky Barnes*) a pretty formative one for me. I would love love love to see Andy and Red post-movie--either of them helping the other cope with life on the outside, trauma they're still carrying from inside, or both of them just finally being happy and free.

(And, okay, yes, if you wanted to adopt my tiny little tin chapeau observation that Red is a lot more nuanced about what it means to be homosexual than you might expect from a guy in 1947 if he'd only ever encountered the prison-rape variety, I would be super happy to read Red/Andy that acknowledges Andy's history of rape and helps him move past it? I realize this is a long shot, do not feel compelled to take it on, but also &lt;3______&lt;3)

I LOVE THIS MANGA AND I WILL LOVE ANY FIC FOR IT.  i go into more detail and suggest a couple ideas in my letter but basically: i would die for virtually any kind of shin/noi content, i also love airisu a lot, and i would love gen/friendship fic between any of the characters too!!  i'm not really into angst with an unhappy ending or breakup fic, but if either of those things are like essential to your vision then i can still read them.  the only things i definitely would not want to read about are major (permanent) character death, noncon, and kidfic/pregnancy stuff.

Punic Wars RPF 
Hannibal Barca (Punic Wars RPF)

Hannibal is THE historical bae for me. He was such a fascinating (and tragic) figure, and yet we know so little about him besides his military exploits. What we do know about him as a person is intriguing—he was a nerd who wrote books in Greek, spoke multiple languages, allegedly went around in multiple wigs/disguises among his own army, could be both ruthlessly pragmatic and yet deeply honourable and respectful to his enemies, and on top of everything was apparently the snarkiest person ever (from the few lines of reported dialogue in Livy).

I would love a fic that explores these lesser-known aspects of Hannibal's character. Bonus points if you manage to make it light-hearted and humorous, since his life was, you know, already so depressing. (That being said, there is a truly frustrating dearth of Hannibal in fic or Internet fandom in general, so just know that anything you write will be water in the desert to me.)

My main ship for this fandom is Hannibal x Scipio Africanus, in both the romantic and brotp sense (my other main ship is Hannibal x Happiness and Peace and Not Being Hounded to Death By Romans). I just can't get enough of how they seemed to genuinely like and respect each other, and how Scipio tried so hard to prevent his fellow Romans from ruining Hannibal after the war. If you choose to explore this relationship, I'd love to see what they thought of each other when they first met, and the slow development of mutual respect and admiration (and attraction, if you go that way) between them. Epistolary! Having to keep in touch post-Zama for boring political reasons and then finding that they genuinely do enjoy their correspondence! AU where they're on the same side/have to work together for some reason! AU where they fake their deaths and live happily ever after!

Hannibal's family was obviously hugely important to him, and I'd equally love to read something that explores his relationships with his father and brothers (and mysterious unnamed sisters). Did he really swear his infamous childhood blood oath? There's a story that his father died sacrificing himself to save Hannibal's life--how did that go down, and how does Hannibal feel about that? Also, kidfic! Tiny Hannibal playing with his even tinier brothers, and/or teaching them how to Be Badass and Fight Rome!

Actually, I'd be really interested in anything set before or after the war; there's just so little out there about Hannibal's childhood in Carthage/Spain, or his postwar exile as a footsore Odysseus wandering the Mediterranean, dodging Romans and flirting with Scipio and throwing snakes at enemy ships. Just. GIVE ME ALL THE HANNIBAL, I'LL EAT IT UP (WHILE WEEPING PROBABLY).

The Last of the Wine - Mary Renault 
Alkibiades (Last of the Wine)

Alkibiades ranks very near the top of my Favourite Historical Assholes list, and as a character in Last of the Wine he combines all the tropes I love to read about most in fiction: the brilliant, silvertongued charmer with all that dash, flamboyance, too few scruples, and maybe—just maybe—some genuine good intentions buried deep, deep down inside. I honestly never get sick of contemplating his various contradictions and complexities (or just straight up giggling at his various youthful escapades, because really).

Tbh, my main ship for this fandom is Alkibiades x the entire city of Athens. That line in Aristophanes ("They pine for him, they hate him, dismiss him, and want him back") is the most delicious sort of Pain ever and I'd love a fic that brings this out somehow (maybe via Alexias' somewhat fanboyish eyes?).

His relationships with Sokrates and Myron are also incredibly fascinating to me, and if you want to include either or both of those characters, I would love anything exploring their dynamics in more detail. What did Sokrates think of his trashfire hellion pupil, really? What did Myron see in him? Did Alkibiades ever feel guilt about not quite living up to their ideals, and did this influence his actions at all?

If you feel up to writing Alkibiades' own POV, what about an introspective character study or monologue set near the end of his life where he reflects on all he's done? What does he make of the entire mess in Sicily? Did he or did he not vandalise the hermai? Does he pine for Athens as much as it pines for him? He comes off as this dashing hurricane, this larger-than-life hero in the book, and I would love if you humanised him a little more.

Or, you know, something lulzy and light-hearted about any of his youthful exploits or scandals. (I am... endlessly amused about how there is an entire genre of Renaissance paintings of Sokrates dragging him out of various brothels.)

On a semi-unrelated note, Alkibiades' speech in the Symposium might be my favourite thing ever.

Howl Series - Diana Wynne Jones 
Howl Pendragon (Howl Series - DWJ)

Howl might be my favourite Drama Baby in all of fiction. I love his contradictions: how he can come off like a self-absorbed whiny pisspot at first, but when you get to know him better you find out he's also well-intentioned and caring and brave in a cowardly way and Trying To Save The Day despite being an all-round mess.

A pre-canon fic set in Wales would be amazing. What was Howl like in university? We know from DWJ that he majored in philosophy—why? Did he ever finish writing his dissertation on spells? When did he first know he was a wizard? How, exactly, did he find the door to Ingary? Was he telling the truth when he said he never met Suliman in Wales?

Howl's early years in Ingary are also really interesting to me. Like, it can't have been easy setting up a life in an entirely new world where he had no money and didn't know anyone. How did he get by? Why on earth did he catch Calcifer? Did he have to use Sophie's cayenne pepper trick a lot when he was first "starting out in a small way"? How did he meet Mrs. Pentstemmon? How many aunts brained him with their frying pans for seducing their niblings?

Or something that fills in the gaps in HMC. Sophie is a really unreliable narrator at the best of times, which is one of the most intriguing and frustrating things about the book, because there's so much we just don't know. What was Howl doing behind the scenes to try and save Suliman and Justin? Where did he really go when he was supposedly out courting? What were his first impressions of Sophie (besides DEATH BY CLEANING, SAVE US ALL)? When did he fall in love with her?

(My main Howl ship is Howl x Wizard Suliman, and I would literally liquefy if you included some juicy interactions with Ben, but you don't have to.)

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

Some possible prompts (slash, gen, and 'queer gen' all welcome):

- Right on the heels of the Dunkirk evacuation comes the Battle of Britain. What is that like for Collins? How does he cope with the strain of flying so often, with so little sleep and so many losses and such high stakes, so soon after he's lost Farrier and Fortis Leader? What are his relationships with the rest of the pilots in his squadron? How does the Collins of late 1940 differ from the Collins of, say, late 1939?

- Farrier's experience as a prisoner of war. Where does he end up, and what does he do there? (Perhaps he's eventually sent to Colditz?) Is he one of the very few who escapes and makes it back to England, or does he remain imprisoned until the end of the war in Europe? What does he do afterwards -- does he try to rejoin a fighter squadron, or has he had enough of flying? What would it be like for him to meet Collins after his repatriation?

- Collins as one of Archibald McIndoe's Guinea Pigs, like Richard Hillary or Geoffrey Page. How would Collins contend with being disabled and/or disfigured; with spending the rest of his war undergoing a difficult series of operations and convalescences; with not being able to fly again? How would he navigate a post-VE reunion with Farrier under those circumstances? 

General DNWs: Homophobia as a central focus of the fic. AUs that take the characters out of the canon setting or significantly change the characters (e.g. genderswap, ageswap, etc).

Canon-specific DNWs: Collins and Farrier written as explicitly heterosexual or as in sexual/romantic relationships with women.

Edward Edward - Lolah Burford 
James Noel Holland, Edward Clare

Some possible prompts:

- The first time I read Edward, Edward, the ending threw me for a loop: after all that, after being subjected to Noel's moods and desires for so long that he's learned to mold himself in opposition or in submission to them, Edward walks away? I have the sense that that wasn't really the end for either of them. So: what if they resumed their relationship, in some form or another? Would it be Noel who sought out Edward, or vice versa? How would they and their dynamic have changed in the interval? 

- One of the episodes that has haunted me most is Noel's seduction of Marion Alleyn after having shown him Edward in the priest hole. What was that like from Noel's perspective? Perhaps he was attempting to satiate himself by having someone close to Edward without actually having Edward? Perhaps he did it simply out of a desire to ruin Edward's friendship as thoroughly as possible? Did he enjoy Edward's response, or did it leave him curiously unsatisfied?

- Despite (or perhaps because of) what he suffers, Edward maintains an extraordinary sense of morality. What if he didn't? If, as the years passed, Noel realized that Edward was becoming more and more like him? Would there come a moment when Edward and Noel found their roles reversed, with Edward as the one who sets the terms of their relationship, who makes Noel his subject? How would Noel react to having his power over Edward wrested away and turned back on him?

General DNWs: Homophobia as a central focus of the fic. AUs that take the characters out of the canon setting or significantly change the characters (e.g. genderswap, ageswap, etc).

Canon-specific DNWs: Sexual activity between Noel and Edward that takes place earlier than it did in canon.

Does he ever meet W.H.R. Rivers outside of Craiglockhart? Perhaps he becomes closer to Robert Graves? How does he remember Sassoon and their relationship? What was their last meeting like, what were the last letters they wrote to each other? 

- Both Sassoon and Owen survive the war. How does their relationship evolve? Do they go off into the countryside and become pig farmers together? Or does Owen become one puzzle-piece of Sassoon's complex and unfortunate love life (would he have to compete with Stephen Tennant)? How do their literary careers compare?

- Sassoon and Owen carry out a secret relationship at Craiglockhart. Who is the one to initiate it? What is the dynamic like between the repressed Sassoon and the slightly more experienced, franker Owen? How does one go about a relationship in 'Dottyville'? Is it really all that secret (there's Rivers to get past, for one)? Do they make any plans for 'after the war ends', or is the relationship predicated on the likelihood of one or both of them being killed?

Dub-con is okay; explicit non-con is iffy but not a deal breaker. I’d prefer not to read stories that focus on infidelity, though I know it can play a role in the backstories of some characters. 

Dudley Smith is one of my all-time favorite villains. Cunning, vice-ridden, fueled by his twisted Catholicism and personal mysticism. Alternately charming and cruel, generous and bloodthirsty. I’d love a story from his point of view, or where he is the center of attention. Of the first L.A. Quartet, I’ve only read L.A. Confidential, but feel free to play around with aspects of the other novels if you prefer, or dip into the Second L.A. Quartet and follow him through the events before, during, or after Perfidia (set during the weeks just before and after Pearl Harbor).

Dub-con is okay; explicit non-con is iffy but not a deal breaker. I’d prefer not to read stories that focus on infidelity, though I know it can play a role in the backstories of some characters. 

I’d love a Smiley-focused story. He is my kind of hero-- reserved, clever, elegant, sensitive, perceptive. Someone who doesn’t always attract a lot of attention, but quietly observes until he knows when to strike. I really enjoyed Gary Oldman’s portrayal of him in this movie. His reservation and inscrutability makes those moments when he is vulnerable--catching Ann with Haydon at the Christmas party, or trying to negotiate with Karla--al the more powerful. Some ideas:

•	A Smiley/Control pairing, or more background on their personal or professional relationship
•	Another long, revelatory afternoon with Connie Sachs, discussing their memories and doubts about the Circus.
•	More examples of Smiley being a crafty spy or mentoring prodigal spies similar to Ricky Tarr
•	Cat and mouse games between Smiley and objects of his espionage or his political rivals

Right now, Sir Malcolm Murray and Vanessa Ives are my favorite characters. I’d really enjoy a story about either one, or featuring them both. I’d be okay with a romantic pairing, a gen fic, or a story that explores some of the tensions between them, without digging too deep into Malcolm’s infidelities. Don’t worry about spoliers; I won’t be. I’m sure I’ll enjoy your story many times as I make my way through the show.

Dub-con is okay; explicit non-con is iffy but not a deal breaker. I’d prefer not to read stories that focus on infidelity, though I know it can play a role in the backstories of some characters. 

The Innocents is among the greatest of ghost story films. I love its setting and mood--the gothic estate, the humid, overgrown environments, the spooky candlelit corridors--and would delight in a story that plays it up. Feel free to play around with any of the core characters. Missing scenes, prequel moments, or an exploration of the immediate aftermath would be especially enjoyable.  Go deep into the sense of suspicion and unease, the sexual repression, the dread. Run with whatever strikes you, but here are some ideas anyhow:

•	What did Flora or Miles experience when they were alone with the ghosts of Miss Jessel or Quint?
•	What is Mrs. Grose’s inner life like as she tries to repress Miss Jessel and Quint’s deaths and the weird happenings that follow? What did she see of Quint and Miss Jessel’s troublesome behavior?
•	What goes through Miss Giddens mind as she tries to process Miles’ flirtatious overtures?
•	Miles might ultimately be “free” of Quint, but is Flora ever really free of Ms. Jessel? 

I acknowledge that in the movie, sexual desires and energies are channeled through the children. That said, I’d prefer not to see them in explicit sexual situations (though I’m okay with such situations for the adult characters). If you’re going to explore these themes with the children, please keep things at the level of the film: kisses and creepy conversation.

14th Century CE RPF 
Henry IV of England (14th Century CE RPF), Vytautas of Lithuania (14th Century CE RPF)

So, Vytautas and Henry did actually meet in real life during Henry's visit to Prussia in 1390. I find it pretty interesting, because one could find several parallels between their lives - both were first cousins and childhood friends to their respective monarchs, both were eventually driven to rebellion (in fact, Vytautas was already on his second attempt in 1390), and both wound up ruling their countries in the end. Yet there were also plenty of differences, and that fascinates me. How well would they have understood one another, if at all? What would they agree or disagree on? Henry thought his sojourn to Prussia was a crusade - I can't imagine Vytautas not taking a cynical view of that, especially since Lithuania had already accepted Christianity in 1386. I love clashing/multiple viewpoints, conflicting values and cultures, grey areas and moral dilemmas. Basically anything about this meeting would delight me!

Hurt/Comfort. I can't get enough of it!

When in doubt any piece with physical/emotional hurt followed by loads of fluffy, caring, touchy-feely comfort in a fandom I love always makes my day.

Things to Please Avoid:

Just a few things I would ask you to please avoid as they are triggers for me. I try to stay away from these things in any stories I read:

Please no darkfic, bondage, BDSM, etc Unhealthy relationships, manipulation and usury. I just do not enjoy these at all.

Canon never told us exactly why or when Heath started calling Victoria "Mother." A story that focused on that would be wonderful, but I truly love their relationship in the show and any story about the relationship between these two would be absolutely fantastic. Gen please.

The Thing from Another World (1951) 
Captain Patrick "Pat" Hendry

I love old school, black and white scifi/horror movies and 'The Things From Another World' is one of the best. One of the draws for me is the interaction between the characters, especially between Capt. Hendry and his flight crew as well as the Captain and Nikki. What happens after the movie ends? Do Pat and Nikki live happily ever after? Does he (and the men under his command) get in trouble for blowing up the UFO and destroying the creature? Or did they fail to burn all of Dr. Carrington's experiments and there's a new alien to face? Inquiring minds want to know!

Worldweavers - Alma Alexander 

I'd love something about the education system, from a child starting their first Ars Magica classes to the creation of the Wandless Academy.  I'm a math teacher, and the mention of mathemagic, spell-solving of equations, and fractionators had me wishing I could see more of those.  Or write something about magic run amok, like feral libraries, or magic as used in crimes and criminal justice, etc.  Or explore some of the other types of magic (the ones mentioned in the list of all the things they tried in order to find Thea's magic).  Or maybe something with society setup, like the Federal Bureau of Magic, or how it's integrated into the everyday lives of people (note the bit in the first book about people not using cars much due to portals, slipways, transfigurations . . .), even as regards to having magic allergies (the medical profession would be interesting!)  Use whatever you know well.  I'm not into sports (the only possible exception is Olympic gymnastics or ice skating which I watched back in the '90s, mainly) or fashion, but I'll find just about any other industry fascinating; I like complex systems and how they work (hence my fascination with air traffic control and airports in general).  The world of Worldweavers feels familiar but there are so many interesting changes!

If you find yourself inspired by Thea, I'd love something set after Dawn of Magic, where she settles into her full power, finishes at Amford, etc.  Does she create anything really special in her life?  Like the Elemental houses, for instance.  Something that no one else could do.

Gold Diggers (1995) 
Beth Easton, Jody Salerno

I nominated and requested both Beth and Jody because to me, this is the core of the film. :)  Really, they are the heart of it all.  I'd love anything from their friendship during the rest of the summer after the events in the film, or at school the following year; they're local celebrities now, but they're not going to let that get to their heads.  What's popularity compared to a friendship you can count on?  I'm good with turning it into a romantic friendship, too.  I just love the bond these two have!  I can see them talking about their dads, about what they'll do when they're grown up, going on more adventures at Bear Mountain…  Feel free to AU things too, if you like the idea of them running away for whatever reason, or if Jody had actually killed Ray, or if Ray did worse things besides beat up Lynette.  (I'm quite OK with some dark themes here as long as the girls end up together and have each other.)  Or what if Beth didn't crash the boat and Jody was living in Bear Mountain by herself?  (whether Ray lived or not)  So many ways to focus on these two girls, and I would have so much love for whatever you write. :D

Demonata Series - Darren Shan 
Bec (Demonata), Grubbs Grady, Kernel Fleck, Lord Loss

As a starting note: I know I requested all four characters here, and while I’d be thrilled with a fic that has the four of them together I’d be equally thrilled to see a fic that focuses on any of them.

The Demonata is one of my favourite book series ever, and probably where my penchant for getting into tiny book fandoms started. It's a really dark story at several parts, whenever the Demonata pop up to be specific, but also contains really compelling characters and plots that keep me interested even when the grimness would otherwise drive me away. It's definitely a horror, but also contains some really interesting fantasy elements and a fascinating approach to magic. It also seems to have a really cast iron tone/moral of hope even on the darkest day, which has always appealed to me. Anything that appreciates the darkness of the setting, while also focusing on hope spots, would be great!

And, uh, this may be a slightly disjointed paragraph as I talk about why I love all the characters here! First of all I love all of the characters in the Kah-Gash, I adore Bec’s smartness and Kernel’s diplomacy against all odds and the way Grubbs just keeps diving over that moral line. I also love Lord Loss, how he is so much the chessmaster and just revels in it. I love how all of the Kah Gash interact with each other, how they truly come to rely on each other but still have numerous conflicting opinions at the end of the series. And I especially love how Lord Loss interacts with all the members of the Kah Gash, how they start off as enemies but end up – at least in the case of Kernel and Bec – definite allies and something close to friends.

Vampire Babylon - Chris Marie Green 
Claudius (Vampire Babylon), Dawn Madison

I just love everything about these books. They're high drama romance novels involving vampires, which should be something that attracts severe side eye, but they're just really enjoyable! Great worldbuilding, absolutely fantastic characters and so much room for porny interpretations. I'd definitely recommend them to anybody who likes vampires and villains.

I really love the interplay between these two, especially in the bits where Claudius is being kept prisoner. I love the darkness within Dawn, and the way that Claudius mirrors that. I love how they both have such complex lives, and quite obviously find a mirror of those lives in each other. Anything exploring the darkness between them and how they react to finding that in each other would be wonderful!

La Peste | The Plague - Albert Camus 
Bernard Rieux, Jean Tarrou

I first read this book only this year, and LOVED it. It's definitely my favourite bit of fiction about a plague! I love the writing style, how beautifully it conveys the quiet desolation of the Plague. I love the choices it presents, and how it examines and treats thosd choices. And I especially love how dark it gets, and yet how it still manages to maintain this essential sense of battle optimism.

My favourite two characters in it are probably these two. Neither of them present themselves as heroes, both actively shirk the term, but both really are. They're both very brave, both very smart and I love how they seem to find some sort of companionship in each other. I'd love to see more of their relationship, from canon style interactions to something more.

Blake & Avery Series - M. J. Carter 
Jeremiah Blake, William Avery

This is absolutely one of my favourite series, and if you’ve read it I’m sure you know why. Interesting plots, wonderful diversity, Historical accuracy AND a relationship between the two main characters so endearing that I had to keep putting my copy of the book down to clutch my face with glee. Truly, a dangerous combination.

As you can probably guess, what I want most in this fandom is fic exploring the relationship between Blake and Avery even further. I loved their dynamic in the book, and I really want to see more of it. Especially in a romantic sense. I feel that there’s a hell of a lot of potential for a really interesting romantic relationship there, and I’d absolutely love to see somebody explore that!

One thing I will say, though, is that adultery is one of my major squicks and so I’d prefer it if you worked around Helen. She can either be friends with Avery or just not appearing, but I’d prefer it if they weren’t actually married if you choose to write a romantic dynamic.

Hap and Leonard (TV) 
Hap Collins (Hap and Leonard (TV)), Leonard Pine (Hap and Leonard (TV))

I love Hap and Leonard’s matter-of-fact bond, where they’re totally paired up no matter who else is in their lives or beds. And they know each other so very well. But I also love how not all their cards are on the table—when they get especially protective (which they so often do), they might try to keep that on the down low (e.g. Hap privately warning Chester, or Leonard privately warning Trudy). I love the flaws that come inextricably with their strengths, and how they may fall down three times but help each other back up four.

I’d love some Hap/Leonard slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it), where they do allow that intimate dimension into their existing marriage. Is it difficult for Leonard to permit that last bit of vulnerability with someone who already knows him as well as Hap? (As opposed to for instance Raoul, who knows him sexually but is kept at more of an emotional distance?) What is it like for Hap, to be allowed in to that last private ground? Or to have that level of connection actually reciprocated, instead of his tradition of longing after the unattainable?

If you don’t want that intimate aspect involved, fair enough—optional details are optional!--but I’d ask that it be at least as intense a bond as in canon, which would make it the warmest of warm gen and the romanciest of bromances.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help: some kind of a small case or mini mystery, if you feel case-storyish? They get stuck together somewhere—in the woods? On a boat? On a vacation that gets complicated? They’re working together on some kind of task, like rebuilding an old house or school or church? Do any of their previous experiences together (as kids or when grown) come back to haunt them?

Feel free to include other characters if you want.

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003) 
Jack Aubrey (M&C 2003), Stephen Maturin (M&C 2003)

Jack and Stephen are the movie's core and throughline, the most important emotional duet. They're so comfortable together, so content with each other and their life, and yet there are still important questions they end up facing--for instance, about what each would sacrifice for the other. It feels like no matter how bonded they are and how well they know each other, there's always something more for them to discover, to overcome, and to willingly give.

I'd love some Jack/Stephen slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) that finds one of these new discoveries, that extends their bond even further than they thought they were allowed to go.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Another adventure or battle? Or the reverse, a very quiet time, an intermission of peace and comfort in between their dangerous missions? Stephen having to go a-spying, and how Jack might react or help? Some time spent ashore, especially far from home? They get captured? Stephen goes naturalizing and takes Jack with him off alone into some strange and wonderful/terrible place?

Rejseholdet | Unit One 
Allan Fischer, Thomas La Cour

I love these guys AND I want to knock their heads together. They are so full of "NOW. KISS." moments, where they're buzzing with desperate energy, staring at each other, seeming to long for SOMETHING--but trapped in themselves and unable to take that step.

Even though there are no partners in Rejseholdet, Fischer and La Cour seem to have forcibly partnered themselves up. And even after the longest workday, they'll be asking each other out for dinner or drinks. Not to mention that we know they holiday together! It's like they can't keep away and they can't stop trying to get closer, even when it's awkward or full of meaningful silences. And when the unit itself is disbanded, their antidote is to grab each other and lunge into a total Me And Him Against The World situation.

I'd love some Fischer/La Cour slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) where they get to feed this undeniable hunger for each other at last and feel thoroughly connected.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

A missing scene from an episode, or an episode aftermath? Something about La Cour's powers and Fischer's supportive belief in him? (What if his powers go wrong somehow? Or if they become instrumental in saving his and/or Fischer’s life? And/or Fischer ends up believing in them more than La Cour does?) A rescue, either physical or emotional? Another case, or the aftermath of one that went well or very badly indeed? Another vacation together? Another undercover mission, this time with La Cour undercover, or even both of them? Post-series reunion?

I like the rest of the team (especially Ingrid and IP, and Boysen too), so feel free to include them if you want.

Shetland (TV) 
Jimmy Perez, Duncan Hunter

Jimmy is protective, calm, steadfast, gentle but driven—he’s such a shepherd to his flock, or if not the shepherd then certainly the sheepdog. He seems like such an idealist, even after all the things he’s seen in his job. Contrariwise, Duncan is more of a cynic, more about the grin and the quick deal, looking out for number one--though when it comes to Jimmy, he is a loving and supportive friend, and that supposed selfishness goes out the window. Circumstances brought them together to parent Cassie, in the least-stereotypical, least-macho ways imaginable, and that relationship seems to have left them open and vulnerable to each other, with deep potential reservoirs of trust and tenderness despite the strains and conflicts of daily life.

I'd love some Jimmy/Duncan slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) that lets them reveal this tenderness more openly to each other, where the closeness they have found is allowed to exist and expand even without the parenting aspect.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Jimmy’s empty-nest syndrome? Cassie’s growing up and moving on, and he could really use some help coping. Jimmy needing Duncan’s help with a case? What about Duncan, the slippery businessman, having to face his own possible fears of openness and idealism? (Don’t they say there’s no cynic like a disappointed idealist?) Hurt/comfort, with Jimmy hurt in some way while digging up clues and Duncan needing to come to his rescue? Or vice-versa?

Feel free to include other characters if you want, though I’d rather not get too far into Tosh’s personal aftermath of her season 3 plot.

The Sting (1973) 
Henry Gondorff, Johnny Hooker

I love Henry's hard-won wisdom, and the way he quietly worries; I love Johnny's eagerness to learn, and the way his energy seems to bring Henry back to life. They've both sought out that underworld life on the edge, and now each has the other to work with, to whet his skills on, and to watch his back. The competence, the risk-taking, the newly-developing knowledge of and need for each other—I'd love to see that go further.

I'd love some Henry/Johnny slash (no porn necessary, but feel free if the story requires it) where they get to extend their new connection beyond the grift, finding new challenges and comforts in each other.

If you already have an idea, please go for it! But if prompts would help:

Henry and Johnny stuck without the con framework to rely on--how might they get to know each other, without work to give them the excuse? Or what if they had to blend in on a totally different social level, either the highest class, or the lowest? 

Another con, big or small, or they play parts to help out someone else's con? Maybe even a con that goes wrong or fails entirely? But totally don't feel like you have to whip up a con if you’d rather not. I'm sure a lot of their life together happens between jobs, whether it's prepping for something, escaping from danger (from the law or the underworld), Johnny learning a new skill, or Henry learning a little something himself.

If it becomes relevant, I ask that the good guys’ cons be against "deserving" targets—fitting the Robin Hoodish tone of the movie, where you go after the well-heeled and greedy, using their own greed to trap them.

I love the rest of the grifters (especially Kid Twist), so feel free to include any of them if you want.

The Goblin Emperor - Katherine Addison 
Csethiro Ceredin, Csevet Aisava, Maia Drazhar

I would adore anything with any combination of these characters - if you want to write just two of them, please feel free! Or something just about Csethiro on her own because she is awesome and I want to know so much more about her. Her childhood, how she learned to fight, her relationships with the other women about the court. I am happy with shipping any of them or all three of them, or friend-shipping them. 

General prompts to be ignored at will: I love Maia's constant deliberate effort to be a good person, and a good ruler; with Csevet's determined control of everything he can manage to manage for Maia, for Csethiro's honesty and her will to fight people (especially when she wishes she could for Maia!) - though as she never gets a chance to in the book, I would love to see her actually get the chance to use her sword! I would love any story about how she and Csevet get along, particularly after the wedding - they will both be a large part of Maia's life, do they end up working together to manage Maia's diary - or Maia himself, to make sure he takes care of himself? I would love the fluff-fic equivalent of Maia just being wrapped up in a fluffy blanket and looked after for a day (and having a chance to meditate!), or Csevet being forced to take the day off (he's working as hard as Maia, but at least he doesn't have to be emperor!) and Csethiro trying to work out how she can help rule would be glorious. 

General likes: I happily read gen/het/slash/femmeslash/poly. Things I adore more than others include worldbuilding, partnerships - especially the development of them - fealty/loyalty, things which feel epic - not in length so much as the sense that there is a whole world about this story which you can glimpse in the offhand details, stories and mythologies within the world of the fiction, characters - especially women - getting to fight and to be awesome and strong in a variety of ways, swords, gender-confusion and gender-play, sensory depictions of the way magic feels, murder mysteries, AUs, and the kinds of crossovers and fusions which really shouldn't work and yet make far too much sense. I also like to see competent people doing things well, and enjoying themselves.

As with 'the goblin emperor' I would adore anything with any combination of these characters - if you want to write just two of them, please feel free! I ship any combination, and friend-ship all combinations. 

General prompts to be ignored at will: I love Kasia and Agnieszka's connection and their history and I'd love to see more of it - maybe Kasia trying to teach Agnieszka some of the skills she was being taught and it going terribly, brilliantly wrong? Agnieszka trying to help Kasia adjust to her new strength and abilities? I adore Agnieszka's stubborn-headed determination and the way she feels her way through her magic, her utter confusion at the complications of the court. In contrast, I love Kasia's calmness and her steadfastness, I'd love something with her and Sarkan getting to know each other better, either during or after canon, maybe bonding over wondering how Agnieszka can be such an impossible nonsense with her mess and her magic and her ability to just find a way to /get things done/ somehow. I love Sarkan's confusion over Agnieska's magic making no sense and his growing unwitting trust in her to somehow do something about any problem, whether he wants to trust in her or not. I also love his care for details and beauty, and how he must love beautiful magic done well - and how that clashes with the utter mess Agnieszka's magic seems and the mess she makes of all his plans and expectations. I'd love it if he could share some of that love of neatness and beautiful things with Kasia, while Agnieszka is mildly and affectionately confused by both of them and can't keep tidy if you pay her (no matter how you pay her).

Magic Knight Rayearth 

I love all the nominated characters! I also love every other character in the whole series. If there is a Rayearth character you want to write about which wasn't one of the four picked, please feel free to branch out! Especially as I nominated a strange handful of characters this year - Zazu, Tarta, and Caldina are characters I would love to have more fic about and Clef's my favourite so I'm always happy with anything with him, but I honestly just want MORE for this fandom. (It's the one I come back to again and again and again and I've had some lovely fic for it from Yuletide before and I would love a little more from the bottom of my heart.) 

I'm happy with whatever variation of canon you want to work with, including a mix, I'm familiar with and very fond of all of them.

My only specific caveat for Rayearth is that I'm not into shipping Presea/Clef or Ascot/Umi (though if you're willing to add Clef in and make it Ascot/Umi/Clef I am perfectly happy!)

Ships I do happily sail off with include - Umi/Clef, Zazu/Ascot, Caldina/LaFarga, Umi/Tarta, Caldina/Tatra, Presea/Hikaru, the knights together in any combination, and practically anything else. 

Some prompt-type things to be ignored at will: I love the tensions between the different characters with their various loyalties in canon - to each other, to their worlds, to what they think they should do. I love the world with its mix of fantasy and scifi tropes. Clef is my favourite character in anything, because of his loyalty, and the dilemma it puts him in and how he battles with the line between loyalty to the people he loves and the land. I'd like him to have a chance to be happy and also actually get some sleep after the events of canon! I'd also love anything about his backstory, how he came to be Guru, learning magic etc. 

I think Zazu is glorious in his enthusiasm for everything but especially giant robots - does he ever get to pilot one? What is it like being a ship's engineer so young - I'd love interactions between him and the rest of the ship's crew. I'd also love to see anything with him getting to know Cephiro and what he makes of the magic. 

Caldina's interesting morality and her honesty about her goals are wonderful. I'd love to know more about her life before Cephiro, or how she and LaFarga became a thing, or what she does once Cephiro is settled - does she get a job? Teach Cephirans to dance? Learn Cephiran magic? 

Tarta's bluntness and her temper probably manage to get her into all kinds of awkward situations, with or without her sister there to pull her out again - I'd love to see something about her when she was younger, or something where she's trying to learn to deal with politics and finds her own way of negotiating them. (Or shippy fic with her and Umi!)

Hank "the Ranger", Eric "the Cavalier", Sheila "the Thief", Presto "the Magician"

Genfic or implied Hank/Sheila. Nothing much more explicit than the cartoon ever got (so, the two of them admitting that they have feelings for each other and wondering where they go from here is fine. One of the two being hurt or captured and the other facing up to having feelings is great. No PWP). If you're giving me gen, I don't like unhappy endings but angst ending on a hopeful note or the ever-popular "Oh no! We missed our chance to get home again! It's okay... there'll be other chances" is fine. You can give me time in the Realm, time before the Realm, time after the Realm.

And you don't need to use all the nominated characters. I don't mind if others are included either.

Spider-Gwen (Comics) 
Gwen Stacy (Spider-Gwen), Matt Murdock (Spider-Gwen)

Other characters welcome too, so long as you've got these two included. Give me banter. Frenemies. Even a situation where they have to work together and maybe discover a few things about one another they hadn't realized. (So growing mutual respect during a temporary alliance, type thing). No romance and nothing over PG-13.

Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) 
Cosme McMoon (Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)), St Clair Bayfield (Florence Foster Jenkins (2016))

Do Not Wants/do not writes:
-crossovers of any kind
-genderswap (though a change on the gender spectrum done realistically is fine)
-modern-day AUs
-scat or vore  

Prompt:
I just really want to know what happened at that crazy party between these two? I already kind of shipped them, a little bit--Cosme's hesitance/shy looks he gives St Clair--and then, to go from crazy partying to waking up the next morning on Clair's couch, and trying to hide all of that from Florence?  

you can take this in any direction you like, and expand upon this as much or as little as you like; are there interactions and thoughts before this that lead up to any sort of culmination? Does Cosme just act as Clair's wingman? I'd just love to see a high-society New York City party in full swing, whatever that might entail!

Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte | Please Save My Earth 
Ogura Jinpachi | Gyokuran, Nishikiyori Issei | Enju

I like reincarnation stories and this one is epic. Anime or manga, I'm not fussy. I would prefer slash between Jinpachi and Issei or gen. Canon het can be included, though I would like Jinpachi and Issei to end up together. It can be future-fic or past timeline fic or current timeline (before the manga epilogue) with Jinpachi and Issei as teenagers. Explore their relationship and how their memories of their past lives affect them today. Or maybe a fic on how they've gotten over the past and living their current lives to the fullest. I would prefer a happy ending but an ambiguous ending is fine as well for this fandom. I would like to avoid a sad or tragic story though as their past lives canon is sad enough.

Usagi Drop | Bunny Drop 
Kawachi Daikichi, Kaga Rin

I have few exceptions where I actually like het and this is one of them. I also love the canon het pairing which isn't the popular choice amongst those who read this series. I would love to read het or gen for this fandom. 

Gen fic when Rin was younger would be great. Explore some of the other holidays or just how Daikichi and Rin interact with the others. Maybe something with Rin's friends. 

Het fic when Rin is older would also be lovely. Maybe something set between the time Rin confesses and Daikichi returns her feelings. How does Daikichi's family handle the news that he's marrying Rin? Or something from Daikichi's POV, how does he fall in love with Rin? Or something post-canon. Maybe Rin and Daikichi as parents.

Happy ending all the way though, please, as this is a cute series and I would prefer to read something in a similar vein to the series.

Amatsuka Megumi, Soga Genzo

This is a hard series to find in English but I loved what I remember of it. Also one of my few het exceptions as I love Megumi and Genzo together. Canon het or gen would be great for this series. On the gen side, you can explore Megumi's relationship with her friends, especially her best friend. Or what about some other adventures and/or other fights? Or maybe something set post-canon with Genzo and Megumi ending up together. If slash is more your thing though, what if Megumi was really born a boy and turns back into a boy? Would Genzo still fall in love with the boy Megumi?

Or set post-canon, do they get a civil partnership? Do they now have a chain of laundrettes? How do they deal with the changes in how homosexuality is viewed in Britain post-canon? How do they deal with their very different cultures and backgrounds? How do their friends and family deal with them?

刀剣乱舞 | Touken Ranbu 
Mutsunokami Yoshiyuki (刀剣乱舞 | Touken Ranbu)

Gen would mostly be preferable since I don't really romantically ship Mutsu with any of the other swords, but I do have a soft spot for Mutsu/Male Saniwa or everybody having a sorta unrequited crush for Mutsu (because he deserves all the love) if you're more slash-inclined.

For prompts, I would honestly just be happy with Mutsu interacting with any swords tbh, be it angsty or fluffy or both, since he's one of the few swords that's not really in any group like the Awataguchi swords or the Shinsengumi swords and the like.

An exploration of his love for technology and generally 'new' things would also be very welcome.

Optional detail that I would appreciate but isn't required would be Mutsu being the starter sword of the saniwa, since he was my starter too lol.

Gen or Slash---for once I don't actually have a preference, because Mutsu/Ryouma is great either way.

But yyeesss. Give me more Mutsu/Ryouma interaction. Maybe the saniwa keeps sending the 2nd unit to Ryouma-centric events and while Mutsu tries and tries to distance himself away, him and Ryouma just keep meeting lol. Ryouma then ending up recognizing Mutsu every time he saves him.

Or maybe canon-divergence where Mutsu and Ryouma did <s>elope</s> run away into the sunset and cruise around the world. Tbh I can't ever see Mutsu doing it, but if you think you can make it convincing, go for it!

I'll start this off with a DNW: Cullen/Aiden ending up romantically together. I enjoyed their friendship, but I am also still bitter about Aiden axing Cullen lol.

For prompts, hmm. I'd be down with Cullen and Aiden slowly and painfully repairing their friendship (see above point about the axing part ahahaha). Throw in some stuff with Cullen dealing with Murderworld trauma <em>and</em> getting used by Zemo and Daimon and co.

I'd also enjoy some Bloodstones sibling bonding if you're inclined, especially if it's the monster-ass-kicking kind of bonding. Alternative would be Cammi, I liked Cullen and Cammi's budding friendship during Murderworld too.

For shippier stuff I'd be down with Cullen meeting some cute guy and finally getting over Aiden. Cute guy can be an OMC, or if you would like to indulge my inner crackshipping self, Young Bobby Drake XD
