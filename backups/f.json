Or would it be a blend where she speaks up more... and regularly infodumps like a champ? After all, her diligence and awkwardness in the show go along well with her geeky side in the book. I know some people feel that they're two very different portrayals but I enjoy them both and I think they dovetail pretty neatly to boot, as it's not unusual for someone who's not the best at social cues to be more open in writing. Chrysta Bell said that one thing she has in common with her character is that they both feel the need to be thoroughly prepared for an upcoming situation and that's an interesting trait too.\nIn general, I don't have any strong preferences for Tammy ships, I just want her with a girl and for the fic to make me get why she likes the other girl and why the other girl likes her. If you're into any option in the tagset, barring Blackie, Denise, Diane and Doris because the age difference would be excessive for me, and adding Shelly and Donna to round it up, go for it, I'm eager to be convinced!\nStarting with the more out there prompts, there was an interview where CB was asked whether she felt that Tammy was “the new Cooper” and she said no but Tammy is trying her best!!! And that Coop is more open to the unknown, and Tammy is only just starting. As I think that Cooper's failures are a big part of the narrative, I'm not sure anyone should aspire to be the new Cooper, but anyway, I've been wondering about these two characters interacting (in dreams?) ever since. Reaching out to her as the new Blue Rose agent and/or as someone who is just starting to peek 'between two worlds', warning her, teaching her, getting to know her and even seeing shades of Albert and Gordon in her. And what would she think of him? And maybe Laura is with him, or maybe it's just Laura and Tammy, secrets whispered to her ear, a world just for them. Maybe Laura could be a better teacher. She knows the darkness. Or maybe she would be too intense. Or maybe she got ripped out of the timeline thanks to sOMEONE and still hasn't fully found herself again so Tammy would meet Carrie instead, how'd that go?\nI have also been thinking about a Tumblr post (linked in letter) about Tammy being the one to find Audrey and how cool it would be see Tammy go through shifted realities, and how she would relate to Audrey, and Audrey to her. I don't know if The Final Dossier will tell us anything about how the rest of the town perceives Audrey's absence, but Tammy could find a clue and start a little investigation of her own?\nCynthia could be a fun partner for supernatural casefic. She's the Air Force side of Blue Rose to Tammy's FBI, like Milford and Gordon in The Secret History, and later Garland and Cooper... we don't know much about her but I love her attitude, I think they'd be a formidable team. ...or they could simply go out one night in Buckhorn before Cynthia flies back. And find a ghost or something.\nThe lack of scenes with just Tammy and Diane is one of my biggest regrets. I was expecting some follow-up to the “fuck you, Tammy” scene, maybe with Tammy a little starstruck and Diane seeing both herself and Coop in this young, naive agent and... trying to open her eyes. Or just them talking about cats, and/or Tammy is surprisingly proficient at mixing a Cosmopolitan, and/or something spooky and surreal happens while they're having breakfast.\nAlbert and Denise are her mentors – we see Albert mother-henning her all the time and Denise seems very protective of Tammy specifically, and I eat up platonic mentor-pupil dynamics with a spoon. Any adventures with either of them? If we swap out Gordon for Denise, what's Tammy's average day with FBI dad and FBI mom (but no shipping them, please) instead of FBI dad and FBI grandpa?\nOr if you can think of any plot that would involve Tammy and Constance, Candie, Jade or Darya, go for it instead.\n\nDNW: Dale/Audrey on Coop's part (whereas Audrey fondly remembering her teen crush on Coop, like the stuff Richard mentions, is okay)\n\nLetter: http://aplaceofstone.tumblr.com/post/166053144566/ao3-faceofstone-dear-yuletide-writer-thank-you\n\n\n"},{"username": "faceofstone","fandom": "ヨコハマ買い出し紀行 | Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou | Record of a Yokohama Shopping Trip ","characters": "Hatsuseno Alpha, Takatsu Kokone","prompt": "Quiet adventures after the end of the manga, please?

He has perfectly good reasons, it makes sense for him to be that way, but he has such a serious case of toxic masculinity poisoning.

I love the realistic depiction of a variety of poly relationships. I love the kink, and the way the kink is not pasted on, but is rather an integral part of the characters and their relationships. I love the positive portrayal of Hugh’s past as a sex worker. And most of all I love that they are all a weird, queer, kinky <em>family</em>, who take care of each other and protect each other and lean on each other and just *hearteyes*\n\nI asked for Hugh and Truman and Will, because the thing I’m most interested in is the evolution of Will and Hugh and Truman’s relationships, both in individual pairs and all three together. I also really love Will/Molly, so inclusion of Molly is entirely welcome. In supporting characters, I like Hugh’s friendship with Lucy, and Will’s friendship with Adam and Beccs, and I'm quite fond of Ally, so I'd welcome inclusion of any of them, as long as the main focus of the story stays on Hugh/Truman/Will.\n\nI’m open to non-porny fic for this fandom, but I admit part of the appeal of this series for me is the degree to which the biggest character and relationship development happens around/within the sex scenes. I love plotty porn, and these books are the ultimate in plotty porn.\n\nI don’t really have many prompts, so much as favorite emotional beats in the series that I’d love to see a bit more about:\n\nMy favorite part of the entire series is how long it takes Will to clue into the fact that Hugh and Truman are not just “the boyfriends”, they’re <em>his</em> boyfriends. And by “favorite”, I mean “makes me want to facepalm forever”.\n\nThat thing where Hugh is great at psychoanalyzing everyone else (especially Will), but completely shit at recognizing what’s going on in his own head? I live for that.\n\nI recognize that it’s a tricky subject, but I’d love a closer look at Truman’s body image issues and the way Will is so good about them and Hugh, for all he doesn’t mean to be, can be <em>so bad</em>, and not even realize it until Will points it out.\n\nI will embrace anything about Will’s intimacy kink, or Will and Hugh’s shared shrink kink.\n\nSpeaking of kink: Will and Truman’s daddy kink is tricky for me. It’s really not my kink, but Ripper mostly makes it work for me in the context of the series. But it’s enough hit or miss for me, that I’d prefer that it not be a big part of any fic I get. You don't have to ignore it altogether, references are great! I'd just prefer it not be the focus. Otherwise, if it’s in the books? I’m up for reading about it!

J. Charles ","characters": "Dominic Frey, Silas Mason, Julius Norreys, Harry Vane","prompt": "For this request, I’m happy with fic for any two or more of my requested characters together, you don’t have to include all four of them if the story doesn’t call for it, but I'd prefer fic about the relationships between some number of them rather than about any one of them alone. I’m interested in both the canon romantic pairings and the non-romantic friendships. Please do not break up any canon couples.\n\nI adore everyone in this series, although it took me until the last book to actually warm up to Richard, but Julius and Harry and Dominic and Silas are my absolute favorites. \n\nI love Harry’s very-understandable desire to escape from the economically precarious and legally chancy life he was born into. I love even more the way he then discovers that you can take the boy out of the radical politics, but you can’t take the radical politics out of the boy, and has to reconcile his new reality with the lifetime of experiences that came before.\n\nJulius breaks my heart, and I adore watching him come back to living again through his love for Harry. Also, that thing where he initially avoids a lot of types of sex because of the intimacy inherent in them? KILLS ME. I’m such a sucker for the standoffish character forced to embrace the messy reality of human emotions.\n\nDominic fascinates me, more than any Tory ever should. I love how principled he is, even as I disagree with many of those principles. And I especially love how as the series goes on he has to reconcile the reality he’s witnessing day-to-day with those principles, and how when they conflict he ultimately acknowledges where his principles have been doing him poorly and adapts them.\n\nSilas is just everything I could ever want in a character. I love and profoundly agree with his politics. I love his loyalty to his friends and his cause. I love that when he realizes that he can no longer side with the Cato Street Conspirators, he’s still unwilling to betray them. Similarly, I love his friendship with David, and the way he’s willing to help spirit him out of Richard’s house in the middle of the night, no questions asked. And I adore beyond measure that Silas gets to fall in love and get a happy romantic ending. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a character like him get that before.\n\nFor fic I’m interested in the network of relationships between these four. Some thoughts on what interests me most about each combo:\n\nHarry and Julius: I love that in the beginning Harry half wants to be with Julius and half wants to <em>be</em> Julius. I love that the sheer joy with which Harry embraces everything around him leads Julius to break out of the shell of reserve and cynicism that he’s built around himself since the end of the wars. I love seeing two dandies together, and fic about their shared sartorial choices would be great. Also, the EARRINGS. I would love fic about them getting those matching earrings. Oh, my heart.\n\nDominic and Silas: I love how much Silas validates Dominic’s desires and constantly reminds him that there is nothing shameful about them. I love the characterization of Silas as Dominic’s werewolf, and how protective of Dominic he is, especially with Richard. And I love how protective of Silas Dominic is in turn. And I squeed so much when Dominic gave Harry to Silas for Christmas. Just, &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3. I love their bonding over books, and Silas introducing Dominic to radical literature. \n\nHarry and Silas: I love that despite the age-difference, Silas is not a father-figure to Harry, but he is a true and loyal friend. I love that when Harry’s struggling to reconcile his new position and his politics Silas doesn’t provide him with any easy answers, but makes him make his own decisions. I love Silas’s admiration for Harry’s mother, and the way, when Harry is focused on his father and his father’s family, he reminds Harry that he’s her son too. \n\nJulius and Silas: Oh man, they both love Harry, but these two are just so different, I don’t think they’ll ever really understand each other? But I love that despite that mutual incomprehension they come to appreciate each other because of that shared love.  I imagine their shared carriage ride to go bring David back to London in A Gentleman’s Position must have been HILARIOUS on so many levels.\n\nJulius and Dominic: I love how at the beginning of the series Dominic is in a shared social circle with Julius, but just doesn’t <em>get</em> him at all, and vice versa. Julius finds Dominic too series, and Dominic finds Julius too frivolous, and at the beginning <em>neither of them is really wrong</em>. And I really love the way that mutual bafflement turns gradually into understanding and then friendship as the series goes on.\n\nDominic and Harry: I feel like I understand the relationship between these two the least, which means fic about them would be great, because I’d love to figure their relationship out.\n\n(See other requests for DNWs)\n\nLetter: http://fairestcat.dreamwidth.org/645699.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "FairestCat","fandom": "The Turner Series - Cat Sebastian ","characters": "Lord Courtenay","prompt": "Oh God, COURTENEY.  The thing where Courteney has spent so much of his life focused on making the people around him happy that he’s only now figuring out what makes <em>him</em> happy? Yeah, that. I really, really, really want fic about that. \n\nI’d especially enjoy fic set within or post-canon for this fandom. I find Courteney figuring out his interests and passions, in and out of the bedroom, really compelling. \n\nOur of bed: once the scandal around the “duel” with Julian has died down, does he take up his seat in the House of Lords, advocating for social reform? Or does he decide to stay in the country doing the smaller but equally important work of advocating and working for his tenants? \n\nIn bed (or settee, other suitably appealing location): the way Julian makes Courteney ask for what he wants during sex? I find that hot as fuck AND emotionally satisfying. \n\nI also love the found family happy ending of this series and would take anything and everything about that, as long as Courteney is at the center of the story.\n\nSpecial mention: I really found it refreshing that none of the conflict between the characters in this story had anything to do with their sexuality.

Is he aware of it? And if he is, how does that contrast with Jim's awareness of his own sexuality? (Presumably Algie was off at boarding school and college getting a classical education - Jim's more likely to have had the school of hard knocks...) And how about Jim?

Has he always lived in Troy? (Is the GTA beachscape as close to the real thing as he's ever gotten?) What happened to his parents? Family? How long has he been working at the checkpoint? Why did he latch on to Lewis in the first place? Is it just because of looks, or did Lewis commit some faux pas when he started by actually talking to him / treating him like a person before he realised it wasn't the done thing? We know hardly anything about Dominic and I'd love to see his life fleshed out a little.\n\n☆ Alternatively, give me some Lewis introspection. In retrospect, does he see clues to his real parentage? Did he always hate Morks - or was there a particular incident that made him determined to see them so negatively, beyond his sister getting hooked on fur? Speaking of fur, he's obviously tried smoking it before - what happened when it became obvious it wasn't affecting him? When the worst of the drama is over, how does he come to terms with his new identity? His initial views on Morks are awful - the whole 'if I was getting sucked off by a goat it wouldn't matter if it was male or female, it would still be disgusting' conversation in response to Dominic asking if he's into guys, for instance. How does he feel now about the things he once believed?\n\n☆ Forced into Porn. We know that there's a market for human on Mork action, so maybe Lilyhot sets them up, or some other random Baddie decides that there is definitely money to made from a film featuring a Mork pounding a border guard. This could be super dark, or relatively light hearted, depending on how you want to play it. (Feel free to include some size kink - Dominic trying to be gentle because Lewis has never even seen a Mork guy in the all together before...)\n\n☆ Reprisals. Lewis is becoming known as a Mork lover and somebody takes exception to that. Or Dominic is assaulted and Lewis steps in to try and rescue him - and ends up making the situation worse. Or maybe its The Alien League who decides to teach one or both of them a lesson. Hurt/Comfort would be beautiful, but I'm happy to just take the hurt!\n\n☆ Sex Pollen, etc. As a half Mork Lewis has never been affected by smoking hair, but who's to say what other weird hybrid reactions he might have to things? Maybe Morks have a sex pollen-esque substance, or go into some kind of crazed Pon Farr state and that's part of the reason the wall was erected in the first place? \n\n☆ Lewis Breaks Dominic's Heart. Dominic thinks he's about to get what he's always wanted - then it turns out Lewis is intent on hurting and using him for whatever reason. The angstier the better, really, with plenty of internalised worry that he must have asked for it or lead Lewis on somehow.\n\nLetter: http://shootingstarrrz.dreamwidth.org/3774.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "falsteloj","fandom": "Southland ","characters": "Ben Sherman, John Cooper (Southland)","prompt": "I completely missed this the first time around, but I'm glad I found the show eventually! I love police procedurals (and all related genres), especially when there is a lot of focus on the interpersonal relationships. I particularly liked the set up of the viewer going in with the rookie - we learn how things work along with Ben, even as we learn more about his character and those he works with.\n\nI'm more than happy for gen or shippy angles with this fandom. What I really like about the idea of Cooper/Sherman is how unequal it is. Cooper is physically bigger, a superior rank, older, more experienced, etc. Sherman's kind of in awe, even as he pushes against Cooper's authority, wanting the other man to take notice of him. Cooper being reluctant at first, believing that he just shouldn't go there - he's in a position of authority, he's too old, Sherman can't possibly know his own mind, etc - makes it even better, especially when Sherman does his best to prove to Cooper that he's completely serious. \n\nPrompt Ideas:\n\n☆ Backstory. They both have some serious drama in their past - John's father is in prison for the rape and murder of his son's high school girlfriend, while Ben's is a successful defense lawyer who nonetheless kept company with criminals and drug dealers. I'd love something exploring their fears of turning into their fathers; John's struggle to stay clean, and perhaps Ben's realisation that he's already on the slippery slope. The danger he is putting others in through the company he's keeping, for example. Ben is a bit of a tosser by S5, there is no getting around the fact, so redemption fic would be completely welcome. Or maybe it's just too late for him to turn back and find the idealistic rookie he once was?\n\n☆ Dirty Talk, Orgasm Denial, etc. John needs to ensure Ben can work well under pressure. Getting him worked up (and up and up) throughout the day and still demanding he be the model professional is way more fun than the methods laid out in the handbook. By the end of shift Ben is a desperate mess - just the way John likes him. Or how about Talked to Orgasm / Coming Untouched. If it's in uniform, I'll love you forever! (Seriously, those uniforms. I've no idea what the patches and shiny things all over it stand for, but I know that I like them.)\n\n☆ Death Fic. I'm firmly in the 'Cooper made a full recovery' camp but, for the purposes of fiction and making me cry, Ben reflecting on all the things he and John never said and did would be more than welcome. Or flip it around and have John angsting over a Ben who was taken too soon.\n\n☆ John steps in post-series. By the end of the show Ben's character was very difficult to tolerate, yet alone like. Perhaps Ben visits him in hospital after the shooting and confesses how he has messed up. John decides taking him back under his wing would be suitable thanks for Ben forcing him into rehab.\n\n☆ Case Fic. Maybe a slice of life with the usual array of garbage calls, or perhaps one of them puts themselves at risk by investigating after hours and the other has to come to their rescue. Super serious or completely light hearted - just cops doing cop things.\n\n☆ First Time with a Guy. Ben worries that John will lose interest if he finds out that he's never done anything with a guy before - he could not be more wrong. John wouldn't be working as a training officer if he begrudged needing to show someone how things work, after all.\n\nLetter: http://shootingstarrrz.dreamwidth.org/3774.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "falsteloj","fandom": "Whitechapel (TV) ","characters": "Joseph Chandler (Whitechapel), Emerson Kent","prompt": "I am a total sucker for historical true crime so I was always primed to be a die hard fan of this show! I loved the creepy elements of the cases, the dark humour, and the relationships between the main cast. I liked that at first glance Chandler was the typical fast-tracked career officer, but it was soon revealed that there was a lot more depth to him. Kent's eagerness to impress Chandler right from the beginning just spoke directly to my inner shipper. :)\n\nPrompt Ideas:\n\n☆ Hurt / Comfort. Kidnapping, injury, ruined careers, whatever you feel like - police fandoms have the best scope for this trope!\n\n☆ Kent and the Dark Side. In S4 it was hinted that Kent was hiding some inner darkness - so let's roll with that. Maybe Kent is so desperate for Chandler to notice him he gets involved in some black magic practices, or has moved into some dingy new flat with a demonic entity just waiting to break his spirit enough for a full blown possession. Feel free to throw all the horror tropes at it. :D\n\n☆ Matchmaking. Everyone knows about Kent's crush on his D.I... except Chandler. Somebody decides to help force things along. (If Chandler initially mistakes it for some new crazy case he has to deal with, so much the better!) It could be sickly sweet and fluffy, or equally perhaps somebody is just encouraging Kent along to see him hurt when Chandler gives him the 'thanks but no thanks' talk.\n\n☆ Undercover as a Couple. It's so close to what Kent really wants, yet so very far away.\n\n☆ Chandler is a complex guy with lots to deal with. I'd love anything exploring how he comes to understand himself over the course of the show - to accept his hang ups, and not to let them rule his life.\n\n☆ Accidental Relationship. When Kent asked Chandler out for a drink the latter never realised Kent meant it as a date. Give me all the oblivious Chandler as Kent is beside himself with happiness, thinking they're just taking things (glacially) slow... Does Chandler freak out when he finally gets the message? Or is he happy with the new direction?\n\n☆ Angst. Kent can't take it any longer and tells Chandler how he feels... Chandler isn't interested. Cue lots of beautiful heartache.\n\nLetter: http://shootingstarrrz.dreamwidth.org/3774.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "falsteloj","fandom": "Y Gwyll | Hinterland ","characters": "Lloyd Elis","prompt": "There are no words for how much I love this show - A noir murder mystery. Set in Wales. Actually filmed in Welsh! :D Its bleak creepy tone is great, and I enjoy the focus on obsession and history repeating that you get in the actual mysteries. I like all the characters (and am obviously happy for them to be included) but I've requested Lloyd specifically because we don't really know very much about him, and that makes him the perfect candidate for some exploratory fanfic to my mind.\n\n* A note on Welsh language: I'll be fine with simple dialogue in Welsh but I'll struggle if narrative sections are written in it. My proficiency level is basically watching daytime soaps / suffering Cyw. xD *\n\nPrompt Ideas:\n\n☆ Case Fic. Maybe it's Lloyd's past tangled up in a case for once. Perhaps Lloyd is just going to save the day with his detective prowess. Or by accidentally stumbling on the solution. Or by getting himself kidnapped. It's all good!\n\n☆ Ship Fic. I ship Lloyd with everyone and anyone - Alex Harries is too cute not to, really - so if you want to write him hooking up with someone, please feel free. It doesn't have to be a character on the show, even; I'm fine with OCs. Eg. Going undercover as a couple for a case and it leading to more, keeping a relationship quiet when surrounded by detectives, coming out / being outed, matchmaking that either takes or leads to some excellent hurt / comfort when his date turns out to be the murderer... \n\n☆ Backstory / Family. Why did Lloyd join the police force? What are his ambitions? Did he ever move away from Wales like Matthias, or is home where his heart is?\n\n☆ Cracky Crossover. I was very into Pobol y Cwm back when Harries was a regular and I still watch it occasionally, so... Maybe Scott is a twin separated at birth / some other murder mystery trope. Maybe he's the dark past Lloyd wants to leave behind. Perhaps some resident of Cwmderi mistakes Lloyd for Scott and wants to mete out their own punishment.

The emotions, including hate, are much stronger, too. And there's this deal with his siblings into the background, which would make the whole relationship even more intense - and, probably, based either on abuse/simple violence or deception (promises of bringing them back to their human-selves? threatening their lives? or Greywolf having an upper hand and trying to force her to help them?). They're reluctant allies in some episodes and I would love to see it explored, too.

I love the foe-yayish vibes I got from it - by don't feel pressured into making it a romance, some sort of \"enemy of mine\", \"honourable enemy\", conflict of loyalties, forced presence and other antagonistic friendship - or friendly antagonists - tropes are my jam, too!). I'd love to see something about Dyrwood's politics, too, at any point of time. Or about Orlan's culture - Twin Elms was the most fascinating location for me. Lliras and Regd requests could easily lead to such a world-building story. Or a story about the beginning of the Dyrwood, their road to independence, their politics and ideals there (and maybe Thaos played a part in that story, too?).\n\nI love the pets, this menagerie we’re collecting during the game, so you can make them part of the background, too (or just mention them in one line, that’s all I need).\n\nAs for prompts (only if you need them, if you have your idea, go for it!):\n- any kind of team-bonding (not necessarily the pleasant way; I think arguments, fighting and crisis could bring people together, too, and I'd gladly read about this kind of familiarity/bonding).\n- Crack or fluff about our team and it’s adventures (or leisure time in Caed Nua).\n– The theme of loyalty, duty, obligation and faith - it's very interesting part of the game, and any kind of the scene/situation/interaction which would show what one (or more) of these means to a character - or how different characters understands these terms - would be welcome.\n- Some cracky-crack about any of the characters or some post-game adventures of the characters,\n- Lliras and his father, Lliras and the Twin Elm's culture - he decided to betray his father, why? Because of moral code? Because of some kind of attachment to the child's family (maybe anything, from the friendship to forbidden romance)? Because he found it an political opportunity? to get a rid of his father? To spite on his father? The options are almost infinitive and I'd love all of them;\n- Aloth relationship with his family and/or himself/Iselmyra and/or Thaos and The Key (either as a past fic, or in a version when he became the double agent) - I'd love to read something about it;\n- Eder and his relationship with his faith (with pets ;)) or some bittersweet fic about his past/childhood? his life in the village, him making his peace with the fact that he doesn't belong there anymore; or him and some of the other companions, especially Sagani, Aloth or Durace (they must have many passionate discussion about religion!)\n\nI’d be happy with some porn/romance, too. Any of those characters would be fine, but I’ve got a soft spot for Aloth-Iselmyr-Eder interactions/pararomance. And I’m most certainly not opposing to throwing the Watcher into this mess. Or making it dub-con (consent issues are inevitable in such situation, I think). Or playing with the traumas all of them have (Aloth and his father, Eder and the war and everything which came after it, the Watcher and… whatever you would like to write her, she’s completely tabula rasa after all) – be it in either totally safe, sane, consensual (fear play would be fascinating, I’m sure) or more dark/dub-con manner.

Feel free to include KoTORII plot&amp;world-building and other, non-requested canonical characters. As for MMO – I haven’t played them, but I have nothing against its bits of canon. I dislike the Legends novel, though. Other general likes - in the letter.\n\nI've got a great Canderous&amp;Carth fic in the previous years. Since I'm a greedy person, I asked for more this year – but please, don't feel like you have to write something similar to the previous one. Or something much different. I'm just very constant when it comes to favourite canons.\n\nPairings:\n\nF!Revan/Carth\nF!Revan/Canderous\nCarth/Canderous\nF!Revan/Carth/Canderous\n\nAs for not requested character pairings, if you are interested in writing them (if not, that's absolutely fine, the list is just in case)\n\nDustil/Mission\nF!Revan/Malak\n\nPrompts, if you need them:\n\n– Conderous is a warrior, Carth is a soldier. That makes for a very interesting team dynamics. They could hate each other, but they had to work together and I like to think they grudgingly came to respect each other. So, there’s a place for snarky banters, fights (not only over ideas and war, but over Revan, too) and missions endangered by their disagreements.Tropes like honourable enemies (or even enemies to lovers! Yaaay!) comes into play, and these are my favourite tropes! Feel free to throw the rest of the crew into the fic, I don’t mind – but it’s of course not necessary, the interactions between Ordo and Carth – any interactions – would be enough to make me very, very happy. \n– Crack stories about their arguments in the mess-room and/or the tricks they played on each other would be great, too. \n– And I’d never say no to the porn. Just not sweet, fluffly one. Dub– and non-con are fine, elements of BDSM are fine, too. \n– I absolutely adore Revan/Carth, it’s my favourite game-pairing of all time, I think. I love it in every version, even the sickly sweet one. I’d be interested in their interaction in game and post-game – finding how to be in relationship during more normal times, without this whole “saving the world” deal. I think that would be especially challenging to Revan, for she, as a Jedi, didn’t have much experience with the family life. \n– I’d like to see them interacting with Dustil. Or just character piece focused on Dustil: how did he feel about his father relationship with Revan? We know that he somehow reconcile with his father, at least in the “good game path”, but I’m sure this process was in fact long, bumpy and full of tensions. I’d love to see explored! I think that post-game Mission could be a great friend (or something more!) for Dustil, but feel forced to include her, as I don't request her.\n– Things which fascinate me in Canderous/Revan are similar to what I like in Canderous/Carth – past enemies, power imbalance, tension. But their friendship, even if tensed, is IMHO real – Revan helped him find a new purpose in life and I feel like he changed her a little, too.\n– Dark AU in which Revan decided not to kill Carth (because of love/possession/irony/etc.) and instead made her toy/pet/official lover. I’d be interested in both porny and plotty/psychological version of that.\n– Sith!Dustil would be fascinating addition to this dynamic (would he be jealous? angry? would he has any privileges because of that or be just another pawn in Revan’s game? maybe she would be using him to punish his father – or maybe he would be the one doing the punishing). HK-47 could be probably used as very eloquent fucking machine.\n– I'm not opposed to Ordo as another lover – less forcefully taken – and his relations with Carth in such scenario.\n\nLetter: http://filigranka.dreamwidth.org/23312.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Filigranka","fandom": "Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) ","characters": "Vernon Roche (Witcher Games), Iorveth (Witcher Games)","prompt": "– AUs, except for the ones mentioned below, \n– fics focusing on gender/sexuality identities, \n– Mpreg, \n– crossovers/fusions, \n– parent-children incest, \n– underage (&lt; 13 years),\n– watersports, scat, vomit, snuff,\n– abortion/miscarriage, children's deaths\n- ideological/freedom fight and/or patriotism being treated as a purely bad, black thing in narration (characters can think whatever suits them; I'm also most definitely not oppose to showing how cruel, for foes and civilians, both ideological fighters and special forces could be, how devastating they are for people's psyche etc., etc., etc. I'd just prefer if the narration didn't bash the above concepts completely; being fair and realistic in approach to them is much welcomed),\n- Ves being raped/tortured. \n\nFeel free to use other, non-requested canonical characters. As for the letter - it's the list of my general likes&amp;dislikes.\n\nHonestly, I just love the foe-yay between these two in the game. That's it. It could be treated like a ship or a purely gen relation - with lots of manipulation, tortures, interrogations, betrayals, conflicted loyalties, forced proximity and whatever other trope about ambiguous relationships you like. I like the conflicted emotions and emotional intensity, and not-killing-each-other-but-always-being-close - if they're a part of the erotic or platonic story, is of no consequence for me and do not influence my enjoyment. I don't care which of them has upper hand, too. When it comes to Iorveth and Roche you can do no wrong (unless you made them fluffy or healthy ship, since I crave the conflict and the danger - the canonical type of relation is totally fine). \n\nAs for little details: I like Roche's hips, especially in the second game, his gloves, especially the difference in feeling/touch between of the leather and the skin and the very... sensual... way in which game shows us him killing (in Vergen, after falling from that bridge, for example). For Iorveth, I probably loves his ruthlessness, cruel idealism and some kind of hypocrisy (he did betray the cause for woman, after all), especially when I imagine his reaction upon realising that. I like the portrayal of his disability, too, the way he doesn't seem to care about it at all. And of course his tactically-stupid obsession about Roche. I prefer his name in Polish version - Iorweth - because that's the way it was spelled in the books, but it's a little preference, so if you don't like it, use the English version, I wouldn't mind.\n\nWhen it comes to Iorveth and Roche all of the most 'tropiest', 'iddy' cliches works for me. Them being forced to cooperate before, during or after the Witcher II (even in some kind of canon-divergence AU, in this case I don't mind), with or without inclusion of the plot of the third game (or the delete materials, e.g. Iorveth in Novigrad), them being on the same diplomatic negotiations, them dying from the boredom on the diplomatic ball, them trying to kill each other (but somehow always failing, for some very suspicious reasons. like in the canon), one of them having to take care of the other (for political/tactical reasons, of course. purely. or to humiliate him), fighting, fucking, raping (I'm not opposed to the idea of Roche being gang-banged by the whole commando. or Iorveth's sharing his favourite toy with Ciaran, if that strikes your fancy - it's not nominated, so it's just an additional idea) talking, interrogating (the scene in the dungeon convinces me Roche was actually good at this job. and he knew how to play the good cop. and I love false gentleness, especially in interrogators), torturing, nurturing, pampering like a pet/prisoner of war, licking boots, whatever. I especially love the scenarios when one of them mixes abuse and caring gestures, but, really, everything and anything will be fine. All my general likes apply to them and that's the pure beauty of the canon for me.\n\nI don't mind throwing Saskia into it - I've got the impression that she, for all her goodness and caring, is a rather pragmatic person. Elves are a good archers, Vergen don't have many units, Scoia'tael are useful, Iorveth's calmness and good mood are important and Roche is a war criminal - Iorveth's, frankly, too, it's one of the many wonderful thing about this ship - so it's probably not a terrible injustice if he is to be punished and treated like a pet or a (sex)toy for a while. Although I'm sure she wouldn't let Iorveth hurt him too much... but 'not too much' it still left many interesting options, especially remembering that she's a dragon.\n\nLetter: http://filigranka.dreamwidth.org/23312.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "finch (afinch)","fandom": "The Baby Sitters Club Club (Podcast) ","characters": "Jason Jasonson, Wandering Frog People, Goliath Hardbody","prompt": "I love Jack's eager attempts at actual intellectual discourse and how Tanner crushes them, over and over again.

In another vein, any Robin/Viv whether present or backstory, romantic or otherwise, would be interesting. Especially since they are such different personalities. Super bonus points for unreliable narrator and/or The Injection with them. I also like Headland's banter with Red. \"I believe there should be a deduction for being a show off fucker\" sums up their relationship nicely.

The girls in new places, the girls in old places, the girls confronting their futures, especially CHANGED futures, the girls encountering lovers or other unexpected people (what do you mean, I married Jimmy from kindergarten?!, that hadn't happened before!).

A lot. I love how you can play Elsa as anything from ruthless but moral to outright Machiavellian. I love how it’s so gay. I love all the cases and wish the game had even more of them.   \n\nI ship Elsa with pretty much everyone other than Althea but Elsa/Vonne is definitely my favorite route and that’s why I chose to request these two characters. One of the appeals of Elsa/Vonne is Vonne’s loyalty to Elsa; I’ve shipped villain/right hand (wo)man ships forever and even though Elsa isn’t really a villain they kind of have a similar dynamic. My Elsa/Vonne playthrough had Vonne as the traitor and that crisis just made her later loyalty feel even stronger. That girl would kill for Elsa - or perhaps help her dispose of the body. They have such a strong bond with so much history and it kills me in a good way how Vonne has been pining for Elsa all this time and Elsa just hasn’t noticed (and also hasn’t realized that she feels the same way).\n\nPossible ideas for a story:\n\n    *The school is haunted! A ghost has been sighted roaming the corridors in the middle of the night and it’s up to the student council to deal with it. Of course this is a great opportunity for Elsa and Vonne to bond. Up to you whether or not there really is a ghost or if there’s a more mundane explanation.\n*Smut. Have Vonne call Elsa “Captain” in bed. Have them have sex when sneaking into someone’s room or during stake outs (I know Elsa doesn’t normally go on those but she wants to hang out with Vonne). Have Elsa bend Vonne over her desk. Have Vonne bend Elsa over that desk - role reversal can be hot too and maybe Elsa likes being the one not in charge every once in a while.\n*We saw Elsa and Vonne get together in the game, but what if it had happened differently? I love the moment when a relationship really turns into a romance, so I’d love to see it happening again in an alternate way.\n*Hurt/comfort with Vonne comforting Elsa. Elsa is usually so cool and collected, when she falls apart for once Vonne is there to comfort her (and make sure that nobody else has to find out about it because Vonne is the only one Elsa feels comfortable being vulnerable around).  \n\nThings I’d rather not read in this fandom: noncon, AUs that completely change the setting(coffeeshop AUs, A/B/O, mundane AUs…), asexuality headcanons, crossovers\n\nLetter: http://fjalamoth.tumblr.com/post/166196783432/yuletide-letter-2017\n\n\n"},{"username": "fjalamoth","fandom": "Dòu Máah Dáan | Peking Opera Blues (1986) ","characters": "Bàahk Nāu | 白妞 | Bai Niu, Cou Wan | Tsao Wan","prompt": "This movie is such a gem.

Despite being British, I've never been a royalist and, before watching the show, had next to no knowledge of the Royal family. The show blew me away with its beautiful sets/costumes/locations and superb acting. But what hooked me was Margaret and Peter’s relationship – I adore them together (I’m also a big Ben Miles fan, so it was nice to see him in uniform!) \n\nMargaret’s vulnerability fascinates me. She hides it so well and when she broke down to her sister, claiming Peter the only one who can calm, reassure or protect her, it made the moments they spent on screen together so much more meaningful. Peter’s calm opposite to her self-confessed “unhinged” personality is perfect. There’s something lovely about his tenderness with her (the scene where she rests her head on his chest in bed comes to mind) and how head over heels she is. I'm a sucker for love stories and mutual pining so this pairing just does it for me. \n\nStory ideas/prompts: \n* Last moments (or last night) together, before announcing their break up. (This could be so bittersweet!)\n* A country ride together, stolen kisses, away from the eyes of the world in picturesque locations.\n* Peter “calming, reassuring and protecting” Margaret.\n* ‘5 times’ they kissed in places they shouldn’t!\n\nSmut is appreciated but not required, of course. \n\nInclude any other characters from the show you’d like, but it's Margaret and Peter I'm here for!\n\n"},{"username": "flowerdeluce","fandom": "Line of Duty ","characters": "Steve Arnott, Ted Hastings","prompt": "Hello, dear Yuletide Author, \n\nIf this is the fandom you’ve been paired with me for, I’m utterly thrilled! There’s very little Line of Duty fic and that’s a shame because it’s such a wonderful show. Every character has their obvious strengths and flaws, yet they’re all so mysterious. The focus always seems to be on the cases and suspects rather than the main team and that’s one of the main reasons I’m intrigued to read about them. It feels like we know a lot about them but we don’t – the perfect excuse for fic to fill the gaps! \n\nSuperintendent Ted Hastings is one of my all-time favourite characters. Clearly, he’s a man of morals; he always wants to do the right thing. From joining the RUC during the Irish Troubles (as a Catholic – BRAVE!) to seeing his AC-12 cases through to the bitter end (even if it means arresting his superior officers) he’s always on the hunt for justice. But who is Ted, really? The audience rarely see anything but his professional persona. I want more Ted Hastings in my life.  \n\nThere’s something fascinating about Steve too. He’s quite arrogant, yet I’m always rooting for him. He’s good at what he does but makes a lot of mistakes, (he's human!) I love seeing him improve as a person, and shaking my fist at him when he refuses to budge. This show piles on the whump for Steve too, and that’s perfect! I like seeing him hurt and I should feel guilty about that but... I only do occasionally. Basically, I’m torn when it comes to Steve Arnott! Protect this boy at all costs, but also give him a slap for being such a \"gobshite\", as Ted calls him. \n\nOh, lovely Steve and Ted, the only non-canon pairing in my requests. Dear Author, if you don’t want to write a fic where they’re shipped, I understand, but I want to note that I ship them like burning. I’d be over the moon with any story about them, so if the thought of them boning is not your bag, please don’t feel like you have make it so. \n\nStory ideas/prompts:\n* Missing scene – Ted speaking with Steve in his cell when he pulls an all-nighter to prove he’s not the Caddy. (Potential for super angst if Ted is unsure of Steve’s innocence…)\n* Missing scene – Ted in the ambulance with Steve after he’s pushed down the stairs. What happened between then and him being back at the office to question Nick Huntley? Or other visits to see Steve in the hospital.\n* Hurt/comfort following Steve whumpage (as he is always getting beaten up, bless him).\n* Steve having sudden panic or PTSD-type symptoms once he’s fully recovered from being pushed down the stairs and Ted helping him calm down. (Example: they exit a lift together and Steve freezes at the memory of the attack.)\n* Ted gets into serious trouble, gets locked up for a bit and Steve stands up for him/attests his innocence. BROS!\n* Case-fic!\n* Rescue missions/saving each other (happy for either of them to be the damsel in distress).\n* Forced bed sharing, heh.\n\nI'm super happy for Kate, Dot or Lindsay to feature as they’re awesome and I love them a LOT but would prefer the story to be focused on Steve and Ted.

We know very little about Danny and Vic, apart from the hints we’re given about where they met. The audience are also left unsure if Danny was playing Vic all along or if he really did love him. I’d love to read anything about them – I absolutely love their relationship dynamic.\n\nStory ideas/prompts:\n* Pre-canon, prison setting – first meetings, relationship development, first moves. (Who left prison first? Did they come and visit the other? They clearly waited for each other.)\n* Missing scenes. (Example: How did Danny find the strength to escape the forest after he’d been shot?)\n* Danny says he fell for a \"mean\" Vic who tells him what to do, who's confident. What about a 5 times story? ‘5 times Vic told Danny what to do and 1 time he didn’t’. \n* Character/relationship study.\n* Domesticity – Pre-canon, perhaps. Did they live together? Were they scraping by?\n* Planning/fantasising what to do/buy with the kidnap money. (Would they both want the same things, what with their age difference?)\n\nI’m happy for you to go down any route regarding Danny’s feelings for Vic (i.e. he was playing him/loved him all along) but, as seems canon, I’d prefer Vic being a bit smitten with Danny. Feel free to include Alice too, if you’d like, she’s a brilliant character! Danny obviously had a past with her, so it could be interesting to read about that intertwining. \n\nIf you want to get smutty with these two, sign me up! If not, sign me up too!

Jeff observing the first explorers, or following his father's footsteps and trying to come to terms with his death?\nAtrus could be searching for Yeesha a few years after she left them and find... something else instead. He could link to D'ni incognito a couple of years after End of Ages and see the Cavern lit up anew, breathing with new life and speaking with new voices. Maybe Yeesha could accompany him (although, good luck with the incognito part in that case). Before writing Releeshahn, he could reflect on some meaningful bit of D'ni history, maybe along with Catherine or Marrim. He could explore the desert before building Tomahna. He could probably see a stalagmite grow faster than D'ni did in between failed attempts at a restoration. He could find beauty in many things and be kind and avoidant to many creatures.\nCalam solo fic would probably be the best fit for a spooky story in the Cavern... or what did this master writer Write after the Fall?\nYeesha simply yeesha-ing around makes for great fic. Did she first see D'ni as a child, with her parents? Maybe she felt something so clearly and then struggled to find it again when she started her journey as a teenager. Maybe she finds Catherine's journals long before the DRF do and reads something about her parents' past, maybe she somehow feels a connection with Catherine after her death.

To quote from my Goodreads review: “Maybe he doesn't deserve Ruben, maybe he doesn't deserve a happy ending, but he doesn't&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;deserve them either.” His backstory makes my heart hurt, and yet it doesn’t excuse his actions as the Crimelord of Gaslight.
