I don't care which name you use for Siete and Song, go ahead and use Seofon if you want. Also, I watched the anime, and I love how Djeeta was shown as strong and effortlessly dispatches enemies, so if you don't know how to interpret Djeeta's character, you can use that. I'm not far enough in the main story to know who Cain and Reinhardtzar are (I'm on chapter 79), but I don't mind spoilers. I also don't know much about Siete or Song since I haven't unlocked any guild wars characters yet, but from what I've heard Siete is absolutely insufferable and entertaining, so if you have any characterization to offer (for Song too), I'd be happy to receive it.\n\nI want to see how Lucifer handles being in the crew, since I imagine that's a completely new situation for him compared to his usual stuff. He probably sneaks off to go do primal beast duties/stuff -- what does that entail? Lucifer is both a playable char and a summon -- how does that work?\n\nHow does the crew tolerate Sandalphon, especially when he first joins the crew? (One take I'd appreciate is if you go canon divergent and make it so that Lucifer doesn't absorb him; if you can come up with other ways to have him join the crew, be my guest, I'd love to see how that happens.)\n\nCanon divergent AU: a world where Sandalphon had won. Does the world collapse without the primarchs? If it does, I think the world might devolve to the apocalypse. I'd also love this with any Sandalphon ship.\n\nFenrir's life.

Where did he come from?\n\nIn Granblues, there's a panel where Percival makes Ange his symbol or spokeswoman or something (I'm so sorry for not remembering which panel it was). How does this work out? \n\nWhy is Djeeta so special? What if she doesn't have a father after all -- what if someone had manipulated the entire world (a primal beast maybe) into imagining him? Breaking the 4th wall encouraged, as well as ideas such as Re:Creators (that one anime where animanga and video games have real worlds, and their creators are considered gods for creating the worlds/characters).

I also love that Polygon, and Griffin McElroy in particular, tends to take video games as settings and then transform them into playgrounds to make whole new games and narratives. All the custom matches they create? I love it. Outside the game play, I love the team’s banter. I love Griffin’s palpable frustration when no one can get their shit together. I love, love, love that they’re SO very not good at this, but doing it anyway. I love that Russ tends to just wander off like he’s just spotted something shiny. I love that Simone keeps accidentally shooting people. I love that Justin passive-aggressively whips out his guitar every time he dies. Basically, I love all of them, and their ridiculousness and how they so often fail their way to success :) \n\nAlso, this particular nomination is interesting to me, because I don’t know if people offering to write this fandom had in mind writing about the Creators of the series (i.e., RPF) or the Characters in this videos (i.e. the avatars). For the record: I’d be totally cool with either. One of the things I like about the series is that it exists in a sort of weird, hybrid FPF/RPF space, and if you wanted to write something that moved between those worlds, I think that’d be amazing. \n\nStories I’d love to see about this series: \n\n* I would love a story where the real-life Awful Squad cast members are transported to the PU:BG universe and actually have to play/survive. Especially if it was in Zombie mode! I would read one million words of their disorganized attempts to outwit, hide from, communicate with or mow down zombies. \n\n* If you wanted to going entirely in-game and fictional, I’d love the WHOLE ENTIRE STORY of the Zombie match in which Kaysauce shows up. Who are they? Where did they come from? What happens after they communicate with the Zombies? Are there consequences for killing them? Why is everyone so insistent on taking their clothes off?\n\n* Maybe some elements of the game escape Jumanji-style and the Awful Squad has to save New York from destruction (oh no)\n\n* Other particular moments in the series that I would love to hear more about: Griffin being constitutionally incapable of leaving his brother behind and going back for him. Simone’s inability to parachute near her peers and her overland journeys to get back to them. Simone accidentally shooting people. Russ wandering off and getting lost.\n\nLetter: http://ionthesparrow.dreamwidth.org/13807.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "ionthesparrow","fandom": "Neck of the Woods - Amy Woolard (Poem) ","characters": null,"prompt": "Things I like about this poem: the imagery in this poem is KILLER.\n\nTwo girls ride ruthlessly\nBeside one another—one filthy as a story, the other filthy\n\nAs a storyteller.

I love the way the story skirts around What Happened or Who They Are or Where They’re Going, but you still get these waves of dread, of longing, of regret and ache. I’m a huge, huge fan of country town/southern gothic where bad things are going on just underneath a beautiful landscape.

Are they lovers? Ex lovers? Sisters? All of the above? \n\n* WHAT HAPPENED. Tell me what went down. What are they on the road for? Running from something? Are they Thelma-and-Louise-style cross country crime-spreeing? Running to something? Dodging the end of the world? Do you want to write something chronicling how it all goes down in flames?

If you've got an idea already, go wild! That said, I ship Magnus/Alex, Hearthstone/Blitzen, and Samirah/Amir, so please do not break up any of these relationships. (I also ship Jack/Riptide – pendant and pen! :-) But I really like the ensemble feel of the books, and a gen adventure is just fine with me. I love that the characters, once they become friends, are so incredibly loyal to each other. I also am happy for any other canonical character to show up, either from this series or the Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus books, and as I say in my general likes, I'm fine with crossovers with fandoms I know or with real-world people. The exception is that I do not want any sort of a crossover with the MCU.\n\nNon-romantic relationships I particularly like are Hearth and Blitz as quasi-parents to Magnus; Sam and Alex's growing sibling relationship, united in their dislike and distrust of their common parent; and Magnus and Sam's friendship. Individually, I particularly like Sam's reconciliation of her strong religious faith with her calling in a completely different religious tradition; Amir coping with his discovery that the world (and his betrothed) are very different from what he'd believed; Hearth's feelings of isolation from the 'elf norm' due to his deafness, and his magical ability that is limited by his own issues; Blitzen's insecurities about his crafting abilities being outside the 'dwarf norm', and his amazing fashion sense; Alex's cockiness and comfort in his or her (as appropriate) own skin, and Alex's presumably literal genderfluidity (shapeshifting!); and Magnus doggedly chasing (hah!) what he knows is right, balancing his affection for his blood family with that for his found family as he tries to save the world.\n\nI don't have many specific prompts, but any backstory explorations (particularly for Hearth and Blitz, and for Sam), expansions of things we see in canon (like Sam's Valkyrie-ing), or canonesque adventures (Hotel Valhalla shenanigans, more encounters with giants or dwarves or gods) would be awesome.\n\nI would particularly like any of the couples mentioned above navigating their particular relationship minefields. Hearth and Blitz act like an old married couple, but they're beings from different worlds – Hearth's world is sunlight-drenched, and sunlight turns Blitz to stone! The tension between Amir's traditional cultural expectations and having a Valkyrie for a girlfriend. Magnus dealing with his complex feelings about his girlfriend sometimes being his boyfriend. (If you write Alex, please respect Alex's pronoun usage as in canon: sometimes he, sometimes she, as appropriate.) If you want to write porn for any of these couples (het or slash for Magnus/Alex, or both at once!), that's okay too, but if you write Samirah/Amir, please make it after their marriage, as I can't imagine them not waiting due to cultural constraint.\n\nI will be reading The Ship of the Dead before Yuletide, so don't worry about spoilers, but also, don't feel obliged to maintain consistency with the new canon.  If I read it in October, I may add some new-canon-inspired prompts to my letter.  Don't feel obliged to take them into account, but if you haven't started writing by that time, they may be useful.\n\nDNW: I do not want fic focusing on pregnancy or children (mentions of either are fine), A/B/O or BSDM dynamics, or major character death. I do not want fic that uses unconventional pronouns (e.g. 'xie'), nonstandard capitalization or punctuation.\n\nPlease see my letter for general likes.\n\nLetter: http://isis.dreamwidth.org/179972.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "Ysabel - Guy Gavriel Kay ","characters": "Ned Marriner, Ysabel (Ysabel), Melanie (Ysabel)","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "Anastasia - Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally ","characters": "Gleb Vaganov (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally)","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "Battlestar Galactica (1978) ","characters": "Apollo (BSG 1978), Starbuck (BSG 1978)","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "The Sandman (Comics) ","characters": "Dream of the Endless | Morpheus","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "Moonlight (2016) ","characters": "Chiron (Moonlight), Kevin (Moonlight)","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "iberiandoctor (jehane18)","fandom": "The Lions of Al-Rassan - Guy Gavriel Kay ","characters": "Ammar ibn Khairan, Rodrigo Belmonte","prompt": "Letter: http://iberiandoctor.dreamwidth.org/35840.html"},{"username": "icandrawamoth","fandom": "Figure Skating RPF ","characters": "Jason Brown (Figure Skating RPF), Nathan Chen (Figure Skating RPF), Karen Chen (Figure Skating RPF), Mariah Bell (Figure Skating RPF)","prompt": "Letter: http://katieattherink.tumblr.com/post/166199693597/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "icandrawamoth","fandom": "Pokemon GO ","characters": "Blanche (Pokemon), Candela (Pokemon), Spark (Pokemon)","prompt": "Letter: http://katieattherink.tumblr.com/post/166199693597/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "icandrawamoth","fandom": "Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator ","characters": "Dadsona (Dream Daddy), Craig Cahn, Damien Bloodmarch, Joseph Christiansen","prompt": "Letter: http://katieattherink.tumblr.com/post/166199693597/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "idleflower","fandom": "The Velvet Room - Zilpha Keatley Snyder ","characters": "Robin Williams (The Velvet Room), Gwen McCurdy","prompt": "Letter: http://idle-flower.tumblr.com/post/166023107379/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "idleflower","fandom": "Exiles Saga and Galactic Milieu - Julian May ","characters": "Felice Landry","prompt": "Letter: http://idle-flower.tumblr.com/post/166023107379/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "illumynare","fandom": "Destiny (Video Game) ","characters": "Failsafe (Destiny), Suraya Hawthorne, Ikora Rey, Ghost (Destiny)","prompt": "Letter: http://illumynare.livejournal.com/2784.html"},{"username": "illumynare","fandom": "Monument Valley 2 (Video Game) ","characters": "Ro's Child (Monument Valley 2), Ro (Monument Valley 2)","prompt": "Letter: http://illumynare.livejournal.com/2784.html"},{"username": "illumynare","fandom": "Jupiter Ascending (2015) ","characters": "Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending), Caine Wise","prompt": "Letter: http://illumynare.livejournal.com/2784.html"},{"username": "imaginarycircus","fandom": "Austin & Murry-O'Keefe Families - Madeleine L'Engle ","characters": "Vicky Austin, Adam Eddington","prompt": "Letter: http://imaginarycircus.tumblr.com/post/166201921799/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "imaginarycircus","fandom": "Pushing Daisies ","characters": "Ned (Pushing Daisies), Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles, Emerson Cod, Olive Snook","prompt": "Letter: http://imaginarycircus.tumblr.com/post/166201921799/dear-yuletide-author"},{"username": "inmyriadbits","fandom": "Banlieue 13 (Movies) ","characters": "Damien Tomaso, Leïto (Banlieue 13)","prompt": "Letter: http://inmyriadbits.dreamwidth.org/218818.html"},{"username": "inmyriadbits","fandom": "Six of Crows Series - Leigh Bardugo ","characters": "Inej Ghafa, Kaz Brekker","prompt": "Letter: http://inmyriadbits.dreamwidth.org/218818.html"},{"username": "inmyriadbits","fandom": "The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner ","characters": "Costis (Queen's Thief), Kamet (Queen's Thief)","prompt": "Letter: http://inmyriadbits.dreamwidth.org/218818.html"},{"username": "inmyriadbits","fandom": "The Eagle | The Eagle of the Ninth (2011) ","characters": "Marcus Flavius Aquila (The Eagle of the Ninth (2011)), Esca Mac Cunoval (The Eagle of the Ninth (2011))","prompt": "Letter: http://inmyriadbits.dreamwidth.org/218818.html"},{"username": "inmyriadbits","fandom": "Society of Gentlemen - K.
