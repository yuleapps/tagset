The Martian - Andy Weir 
Chris Beck (The Martian - Andy Weir), Beth Johanssen (The Martian - Andy Weir), Mark Watney (The Martian - Andy Weir)

Hi! My favorite part of this fandom is all the fics taking care of Watney when he gets back to the Hermes, but I think it'd also be really cool to look at the other characters having issues and Mark reveling in the chance to help his crewmates for once. An obvious example would be Beck all torn up about declaring Watney dead. Or maybe Beth has nightmares about watching him die. After being alone on Mars for so long, I think Mark would be particularly starved for social contact, including taking care of others, and I'd be really fun to explore that. I love gen fic and Beck/Johanssen/Watney, and I'm currently digging fluffy, happy things, so please no dark fic. I'm sure I'll love whatever you write! Thanks!!

Wonder Woman (2017) 
The Amazons (Wonder Woman 2017), Diana Prince (Wonder Woman 2017)

Hi! I am so fascinated by the brief glimpses of we get of Themyscira in the movie. Diana is mostly interested in the warriors, but it's clear that there is a broad and thriving culture. I'd love to know about courting rituals and what kind of entertainment they have. I'd also love to read about Diana's adventures growing up on the island, and how it shapes how she interacts with people in the world of men. When she gets the ice cream, she tells the seller that he must be very proud, and it's lovely to think of an entire island that supports each other with common-place kindness, and how that might become integrated into polite society and etiquette. Also, I've listed a lot of gen ideas, but I read Diana/Steve and Diana/Etta if either of those are your favorite. Whatever you write, I'm sure I'll love it, Author, thanks!!

Elemental Logic - Laurie J. Marks 
Medric (Elemental Logic), Karis G'deon, Zanja na'Tarwein

Thank you so much for agreeing to write a story for me! I love Yuletide, and so look forward to opening my surprise!

The characters in the Elemental Logic books have a warmth and an intensity that I find compelling, and the matter-of-fact and inclusive approach to gender, sexuality and chosen family is so refreshing and validating. But the thing that really hooked me, was the riveting, visceral description of sensations, that made touch and taste and textures come alive.

Maybe an adventure story for Zanja from before she meet Karis? Or someone (Medric?) develops a giant crush on Karis, and tries to hide it, with comedic results? Whatever you write would be great: I'd be so happy to read a new story in this world.

I'm fine with a story including both of them, or only one of them. I'd love a story where Greg Bird talks to birds, or Aaron Judge is a giant-- run with any magical tropes you want, including stadium ghosts. Something exploring time in the minor leagues and what it's like to be called up to the big leagues. I love New York, I love the history and romanticism and myths of baseball, and I'd love to see anything playing with that. Absolutely fine with gen fic or shipfic.

Richard I of England (Third Crusade), Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb | Saladin (Third Crusade)

Richard and Saladin probably never met in person, and the crusades were very horrible. However, as star-crossed historical OTPs go, this is such a great one, and I think it's a shame that there seems to be basically no fic about them. What if they had met in person? What if they did, only that meeting never made it into the historical record (for reasons)? What other kinds of letters might they have been exchanging? (I love an epistolary romance!) I have no objections to tragedy, here, or to realism, but please feel free to fuck around with history to your heart's content. Star-crossed historical OTP!

If you're up for writing porn, I am 1000% here for that, and I would adore something set immediately after the end of the movie. I'd also really love a story that explores how they build a relationship and figure out their lives together. You can go anywhere you want with this, and I'm not afraid of realism and hardship, here, but their happy ending is also very important to me. I really love the tone and style of this movie, too, and would be super happy if that carried over into fic.

I grew up watching the 1967 Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave movie version of Camelot, and I'm not saying that this was baby's first OT3—additional contenders include Singin' in the Rain, Fame, and Cyrano de Bergerac—but it's definitely one of them. I love the musical and the movie, and it's pretty deeply written into my narrative DNA. If you can find a way for Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot to have a happy ending, I am completely on board; that said, I really do love the bittersweet tragedy of the story. Anything with this OT3 would be lovely, however you want to do it—there's obviously lots of room to work within the canon of the musical, but please feel free to go outside that, if you want to (including going wild with Arthurian legend); I am definitely not a purist!

The Culture - Iain M. Banks 
Skaffen-Amtiskaw

I love any fiction that explores AI characters. I adore the Culture's Minds and drones, and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw is one of my favourites. Suggested prompts: you could explore some of its backstory, or what happened after Use of Weapons, its relationship with Sma, its odd obsession with Sma's sex life (!)...an action scene etc. For something more specific along the action line, you could take Skaffen-Amtiskaw's promise to Sma to \"use minimum force from now on\" and explore a dangerous situation where this promise is difficult to keep - not necessarily with Sma. (I haven't put Sma as a listed character because it's optional for her to be included; but as the drone is her bodyguard I've mentioned her in some of the suggested prompts).
I Do Not Want: any non-con, or death fics (of the major character, peripherals are fine!), please.

So anything that is more would be great; in terms of prompts, I don't mind if you want to go for a carefully worded diplomatic discussion, or full-on slash, or anything in between. I would guess setting it sometime after Bren negotiated with Machigi to trade with the East would make the most sense.

I am a sucker for stories about undercover cops in general, and this movie is one of my favorites. These two have such an interesting relationship-- they're in complete opposition to each other, with no chance whatsoever of compromise, but they do develop a kind of bond, even one based on lies. By the end of the movie \"Vic\" is the only person trying to keep Cody alive, while knowing that his life depends on making sure that Cody trusts him. There's a level of uncomfortable intimacy, with Hank more or less taking the place of Cody's mother, the only person in the world that he cares about, and I would love to see a story (gen or slash) explore that dynamic.

Oh man oh man, this movie had so much potential, mainly due to these two. Bonnie and Clyde of the modern age! I'd love to see backstory fic for them because I want to know everything: how they met, when they became so devoted to each other, why they became so devoted to each other. You can go with Bats' insinuations, but I'd like to see something different. I like the implication that Darling led Buddy into crime and not the other way around because it flips the typical narrative. I's also love an AU where they both live and get away, and what happens to them after. Or an AU where Buddy dies instead of Darling (my one exception to my character death DNW). I just wanted so much more for these two! See my letter for more details!

I'd also really love a slow-burn OT3 fic where Jokaste sticks around and helps them and Damen helps take care of her and her son, and Jokaste and Laurent have to find some common ground, or an AU where Jokaste's son IS Damen's son and how they handle that dynamic. I really adored her back and forth with Laurent and would love to see more interactions between them! See my letter for more details! 

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse, graphic depictions of suicide, cross-gen incest (unless in the case of Laurent, it's backstory), unrequested pairings, setting AUs, character death, first-person POV.

Castlevania (Cartoon) 
Trevor Belmont (Castlevania (Cartoon)), Sypha Belnades (Castlevania (Cartoon)), Alucard (Castlevania (Cartoon))

Four twenty-minute episodes are just not enough! Mainlining this show only left me wanting more. I'd love OT3 fic with them fighting monsters, or especially a slow burn coming together fic. I'm all for Alucard/Trevor as a dynamic and I'd love to see their animosity explored as closeness develops. Vampire tropes are my favorite! I'd love a fic where Alucard has to feed on one of them (or both of them!) to survive. I'd also adore Sypha/Alucard fic with her coming to terms with Alucard being her vampire Jesus.

Richard Gecko (FDTD TV), Seth Gecko (FDTD TV), Manola Jimenez (FDTD TV), Santanico Pandemonium (FDTD TV)

Ah! The show of my heart! I'd love anything you'd write me for these four: backstory fic for Kisa and Manola, both individually and together, backstory fic for the Geckos growing up, AUs where Manola lives and comes along for the ride. In terms of Geckos, I'm very much open to incest and would love to see anything that explores their die-without-out symbiotic desperate codependence from any perspective. I'm also open to poly dynamics with Kisa and Manola, and would honestly adore an AU of S3  where Manola lives and she worms her way into Seth and Richie's affections. She and Seth have similar personalities, it'd be interesting to see them bonding through sparring as Richie and Kisa work through their past. See my letter for more details!

Moonlight (2016) 
Chiron (Moonlight), Kevin (Moonlight)

This movie aches. It rendered me speechless and left me wanting. I want to see more of what happened to between Chiron and Kevin post-movie. Chiron driving halfway across the country is quite a statement and I'd love a continuation that focuses on Chiron not leaving and slowly worming his way into Kevin's life as they build a life together. I'd also love an AU where the fight never happens and Chiron never goes to juvie and he and Kevin go further with each other from that moment on the beach, growing up together and figuring out themselves alongside each other. I also really love the symbolism of the ocean and what it means to Chiron, and I'd love some focus on the fact that Kevin lives by the ocean and Chiron hears it when he arrives at his place. See my letter for more details!

Teeth - Hannah Moskowitz 
Rudy (Teeth - Hannah Moskowitz), Teeth (Teeth - Hannah Moskowitz)

I read this book in one sitting and it floored me with how painful and raw it was. I was left with wanting more and someone to fix it. I don't necessarily think the ending was wrong (because I think it fit, even if it broke me a bit), but I'd love to see a future fic where Rudy finds Teeth again, or Teeth returns to the island and finds Rudy changed. I'd love to see them reconnecting as adults and how the island most likely shaped Rudy and how Teeth has grown from his travels. I'd also like to see a fic that focuses on their time together and further exploration of their sexuality. Or simply a dark messy AU where Teeth decides to stay and the continued strain of the dynamic between them. I just want so much more! See my letter for more details!

Parable Series - Octavia E. Butler 
Doe Mora (Parable Series), May (Parable Series), Imara (Parable Series)

Basic prompt: any of the kernels of ideas about Imara Octavia Butler tried to write as Parable of the Trickster, as described in this article -- https://electricliterature.com/now-more-than-ever-we-wish-we-had-these-lost-octavia-butler-novels-659f0b2e5d36 -- because I feel incredibly cheated that the world never got to have that book.  I don't expect you to be Octavia Butler because no one else could be, but I was so intrigued by all of those notions that she tried to explore and wasn't able to work through.  Alternatively, if it feels too presumptuous to try to write the story Octavia Butler never got to/couldn't write, I'd like a fic in which May manages to escape Earthseed-being-turned-into-Camp-Christian with Kassi and Mercy -- how they build a life for themselves on the outside, two children and a woman with an amputated tongue in that unforgiving dystopian world.  And I really like Doe (and Tori) and would like to hear about her recovery from the trauma of Camp Christian and her bringing a child into that world.  I don't need all characters in one story.

Near Dark (1987) 
Severen (Near Dark)

Severen is such a fascinating character. Paxton plays him incredibly, of course, and the writing for him is so good, but I love how even his wardrobe hints at a richer backstory (all of those badges and patches decorating his jacket like hunting trophies, for one). I'd love to read anything you're inclined to write about him: how he was turned, how he first got along with Diamondback and Jesse, a typical night in the life, what other '80s pop songs other than John Parr's 'Naughty Naughty' he dances to while tearing the throats out of his victims... go wild.

IT (2017) 
Beverly Marsh (It (2017))

Despite loving the movie overall, I was pretty disappointed with how the filmmakers chose to handle Beverly's character. Sophia Lillis did an incredible job with what she was given, but it was a shame seeing what few moments of glory Bev received in the book be snatched away from her. 

Something exploring Bev outside of her desirability to boys (and men, ugh) alike would really make my day. Her platonic friendships with the other Losers being erased made me pretty sad, so something exploring those would be cool. I'd also be interested in knowing the real history between Bev and the bullies - Henry's a liar, but I do think something happened to spark that animosity. If you want to explore 2017 adult Bev, I'd love to see her friendship with Kay McCall. 

(I also wouldn't be upset with a retcon of the last twenty minutes of the movie, in which Bev is never kidnapped - and maybe even gets to brandish that slingshot of hers.)

Not to say I'm entirely averse to Bev receiving some form of romance, and if that's what you'd like to write, please don't feel discouraged. But as the whole Bev/Bill/Ben triangle is one of my least favorite parts of the book, if you're interested in writing a romance for Bev, I'd much prefer her with someone else - perhaps one of the other Losers, or one of the bullies (Gretta or any of the boys - just please no abusive situations, if you do go down this road), or (as an adult) with Kay McCall. (Although I'd like to quickly clarify - kissing and making out is fine, but to break tradition from Mr. King, no sexual content if the characters are underage, please!)

昭和元禄落語心中 | Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (Anime) 
Kikuhiko | Yuurakutei Yakumo, Yotarou (Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu)

This was the relationship that canon left me wanting more of. I love how quickly and fiercely dedicated Yotarou is to his master, and Kikuhiko's cool, belabored affection for him.

I would love to see more of their complicated emotional relationship, however you'd like to show it. I would be into an exploration of Yotarou's feelings toward Kikuhiko (respect teetering toward adoration, and some complicated romantic feelings also).

I'd also be interested in it from Kikuhiko's end--what is it like to know he has this power over Yotarou? How does it feel to be wanted again after so long? Would he feel bad about taking advantage of Yotarou's interest or not? What do the similarities between Yotarou and Sukeroku do to him? What about the differences?

I'd be interested in a snapshot of their relationship at any point in their knowing each other. If you feel like taking it to E rated territory, I would definitely be cool with that! Yotarou seems pretty eager to please, and Kikuhiko is a pretty frosty, distant dom in my mind, but he does have a soft spot for Yotarou, and some decent fucked up feelings about his past with Sukeroku, so that can be many kinds of complicated.

Grasshopper Jungle - Andrew Smith 
Robbie Brees, Austin Szerba, Shannon Collins

I loved this book so much. I loved Austin’s emotional honesty, his bluntness, and his desire to understand himself and explore what he wanted. I love Robbie’s unwavering dedication to and affection for Austin, no matter what Austin does, but how he’ll still call him out when he’s being selfish. I'm interested in any combo of these 3 characters as a focus.

I’d love anything that explored their relationships post-apocalypse: Them in the shelter, or, for Robbie and Austin alone, them on one of their ventures out into the rest of the world postcanon would be really cool.

I’d enjoy relationship negotiation stuff-- how do they (either the twosome or threesome) make it work (and I want them to make it work)? Austin is clearly conflicted about his feelings for Robbie and Shannon, and Robbie and Shannon don’t seem sexually interested in each other, just Austin. How do they work through that?

I'd be into a nice angst/fluff combo- i mean, their situation is dire, but them comforting each other, or talking about how fucked they are while being physically affectionate, would be great.

You can feel free to get as sexy as you want with them, too.

If you keep it just Austin/Robbie, please be kind to Shannon. I don’t want them bashing her or complaining about her too much (though discussing their relationship in regards to her is fine, as long as you keep in mind that they all are friends/important to each other).

In general I don’t like 1st person POV, but since the canon is 1st person, I would be fine with it here, if you wanted to do that. I’m also good with other POV options, though.

I am extremely into selfcest. It is such a good narrative vessel for introspection and self evaluation and makes for some weird and poignant intimacy. This music video was a formative thing for me back in the day, too.

I would LOVE anything with Lucky/Britney. You can go with whatever method of getting them together that you want (time travel/split selves/dreams/parallel universes/whatever) or go with Lucky not actually being able to see Britney, if you want to be cruel.

Does Britney help Lucky unwind and find what's missing in her life (herself)? Do they swap lives so Lucky can have a break? Hurt/comfort? Whatever you want to go with would be good. I just like the idea of them understanding each other's problems and finding solace in each other, or trying to, anyway.

At Swim Two Boys - Jamie O'Neill

I have loved these two for like 13 years, and I still get sad when I think about their tragic end in the book. They get so little time together to be happy! I want more!

You can give them an alternate ending, or just give me another scene of the two of them being happy together (or bittersweet is fine, though hopefully mostly on the sweet end). I’d also be down for an AU of them, putting them in another situation where things are less dire and they can find a way to be together (meeting on a swim team? or still at the 40 foot, but without war screwing everything up? idk, put them anywhere you want).

Don’t worry about trying to match the writing style of the canon. I mean, go for it if you want! But don’t be afraid of writing it just because of that.

Just, anything with them able to have more time together, either with domesticity/fluff or feelingsy smut. I don’t mind Macmurrough being involved, either, if you want him to be, but if you make it a modern AU, I’d rather you leave him out, sex-wise.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye, Janet (The Good Place), Michael (The Good Place)

You don't need to use all the characters, and other characters would also be fine. I'd love to see an expansion of one of the cycles we see in Dance Dance Resolution (S2 Ep 2). Any human/human romantic relationship is fine, or human/Janet, but please don't pair up a human with any of the demons. See letter for more general details and more details on each fandom.

Oxenfree 
Alex (Oxenfree), The Sunken (Oxenfree)

I'd love a fic about Alex ending the cycle she's stuck in, with her as the driving force behind her own escape. Through wit or doing something drastic or banishing The Sunken into oblivion. Any other characters are okay, and hell, any ship is okay too! As long as Alex is the focus. I've got no triggers or preferences for rating, so feel free to do whatever.

Philip Marlowe

Write me a short mystery-- Maybe Marlowe meets a mysterious stranger in a bar. Maybe he finds a hollow pool ball containing a secret message. It can be anything you want. You can even make it like, some unsolvable cryptid thing if you want, haha. I've got no triggers, so you can breach any darker subject if you so choose. I'd prefer it if this fic was gen.

Venus Fly - Grimes ft. Janelle Monáe (Music Video) 
Venus (Venus Fly), Woman with the Flaming Sword (Venus Fly)

I want some ridiculous fantasy adventure and/or sci-fi fic about these two ladies. Setting and characterization is up to you (are they... battle nuns in the year 3000? Dragon slayer witches from medieval Europe? Goddesses in space?) I just want it as WILD as the video!

Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) 
Geralt z Rivii | Geralt of Rivia (Witcher Games)

I want a Witcher contract story. A fic about Geralt hunting a creature, kicking ass, and demonstrating all that quality Geralt dialogue. I'd prefer it if you thought up a fun new contract adventure for Geralt to go on, but if you can't think of anything, writing about a contract we saw in game is okay. Any other characters are okay to come along for the ride as long as they were in the Witcher 3, and as long as Geralt is the focus. Feel free to go into violent/sexy/weird territory if you so choose, I have no triggers.

Calvin & Hobbes 

I adore the strip, and I'll take any kind of fic for it! All and any characters are fine! Run wild! If the story doesn't go anywhere, put it in the Transmogrifier and see it turn into something completely different (and possibly covered in radioactive slime). If you want to go in a romantic direction, the following pairings are fine with me: Calvin's parents, Calvin/Susie, anyone else/anyone else.

Philosophy RPF 
Johannes Calvin (Philosophy RPF), Thomas Hobbes (Philosophy RPF)

This request is 100% due to this art: https://spacecoyote.deviantart.com/art/John-Calvin-and-Thomas-Hobbes-68330601 and the brilliant tag line: \"Few historians know of the heartwarming friendship between French Reformation theologian John Calvin and English political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, the latter of whom may or may not have been real, considering he was not even born yet.\"

So, this obviously started out from my eternal love for the comic Calvin and Hobbes, but I do actually have a deep interest in philosophy and theology, and ever since I've seen that picture, I've been wondering about what these two would say to each other...

Twelve years after its debut, this commercial is still the cutest thing I've ever seen and I just want to know more about this adorable panda and her? his? their? adventures around the world! 

Would prefer fluffy, funny or plotty fic, but if you're wtching this commerial and are struck with the sudden urge to write a satire or something serious, I'm not going to say no! Anything goes, as long as no pandas are permanently harmed in the production of your fic.

Dixit (Card Game) 

I love surrealism (Magritte may be my favorite painter), and these cards have a lot of it. I really don't have a specific prompt, but I feel like there are two ways to go here: You could write fic about the gameplay itself, or fic that just concentrates on the artwork and disregards the game entirely. I'm good with both! You could tell the story of a group of players that gets stuck in a set of four cards and has to work out which of them really encompasses the feeling of [eternal love/rain/the multiverse/whatever was the prompt]. You could focus on a single card and just try to tell that story, or pick multiple ones, or just something that's not based on any specific cards and just captures the surrealist, ambiguous, often somewhat spooky feeling of the artwork.

Expert Judgment on Markers to Deter Inadvertent Human Intrusion... - Sandia Labs 
Color Changing Cat

The reason I’m requesting Color Changing Cat is because I would really like a specific cat. I’d love a cat that has a name or at least an identity, even if you don’t name it. You are welcome to include any or all of the other nominated characters, or come up with your own OCs as long as the cat has a central role in the story.

1) Who is the very first Color Changing Cat?

2) The leader of a cat colony knows her job: keep people out!

3) In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a person or a couple depend on their cat for survival.

4) A cat searches for a safe place to have her kittens. She finds a small den with plenty of creatures around to eat. But something strange keeps happening to her fur…

5) Linda and Jo are transferred to a new settlement. They’re not exactly happy about it because there’ve been vague rumors of a sickness. They bring their cat, who starts acting very oddly. And his/her color changes when he visits certain areas. They have no idea what’s going on, but they mean to find out!

6) Random Ideas: Color Changing Cat IN SPAAAACE, with wings (hey, they do live near a nuclear waste disposal site), saves the day, matchmaker, is a member of an intelligent race of cat archaeologists, does not make a good pet, gets filmed by wildlife experts for a nature show. 

DNW: amnesia, permanent brain damage, eyeball injury, character bashing, death, no current political commentary.

Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated (TV 2010) 
Velma Dinkley (Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated (TV 2010)), Marcie \"Hot Dog Water\" Fleach (Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated (TV 2010))

1) If you want to write a Gen story, then I’d love to see Velma and Marcie working together on a case. Maybe they have to pull a heist to retrieve some kind of information or artifact. Or maybe an investigation into some supernatural phenomena that is solved with science! A future fic with Velma and Marcie running their own detective agency would be awesome!

2) For more Gen, Velma and Marcie working on a science fair project. Do they win?

3) If you are into Velma/Marcie, then holding hands, a first kiss, a first date, is fine by me.

4) I’d love a story where Marcie is distracted by Velma’s neck. Why does Velma always wear turtleneck sweaters? What is she hiding? Marcie can hardly think straight for imagining what’s under that sweater. It would be fun if Marcie comes up with a scheme to get Velma’s neck NAKED!

5) I can’t think of a fandom better tailored for TENTACLE PORN!!! I know! I can’t believe I hadn’t thought of this the last time I asked for this fandom! I can imagine Velma and Marcie running into some tentacle creature during an investigation. OR maybe they find a spell book, and are flipping through the pages, making fun of people who believe in such superstitious nonsense. They read some bits out loud and suddenly TENTACLES!

I’m not looking for anything too dark and awful. The show is a mixture of seriousness and goofiness, so something along the same lines. My only other request is that it’s the two of them together, and not just one or the other getting TENTACLED.

Baian the Assassin 
Fujieda Baian

1) Baian finds himself in an unexpected altercation but must maintain his cover as a doctor. How does he keep from being hurt without revealing he knows more about fighting than a doctor should? 

2) On a cold winter’s night, Baian and Hikojiro share a meal, and entertain each other by telling stories. What kind of stories do they tell? Scary stories? Stories about their pasts? Some kind of tall tale?

3) Baian is asked to assassinate a man who has a reputation for being wise and good. He’s reluctant to take the job without investigating first.

4) It’s not explicit in the show, but Baian seems to have a relationship with O-Mon’s children. Baian spending some leisure time with O-Mon and her children would be lovely!

5) There was an episode featuring Baian’s long, lost sister. What if someone else from Baian’s past shows up?

DNW: amnesia, permanent brain damage, eyeball injury, character bashing, death, no current political commentary.
