Temeraire - Naomi Novik 
Tenzing Tharkay, Sipho Tsuluka Dlamini, Emily Roland, William Laurence

There are SO MANY fics I might like to see in this fandom, and those characters I listed are all options - you don't have to try to put all of them in. Ship-wise, I'm very fond of Laurence/Tharkay and Emily/Demane, but gen is just as good. Do Not Wants include noncon and unleavened bleakness.

I'd be happy with any fic you'd like to write within those parameters, but if you would like prompts, here are some!

1. Tharkay adjusting to his new life. How does he deal with being responsible for the land and its tenants? Does this mean he has to deal with other gentry now? What do people think of his permanent guests, Laurence and Temeraire? Does he get sucked into Temeraire's political career by sheer proximity? Does Lady Allendale involve herself? Are his cousins still plotting to sell him out to the French?

2. Sipho's continuing education. Basically I would just love to see fic where Sipho's tutelage under Temeraire continues until he ends up in university and becomes the world-class cartographer and natural philosopher we know he will be one day.

3. Emily and Demane making it work. Sailors made it work; who says aviators can't? (Okay, Emily's mum, but she's a bit biased.)

4. Laurence's retirement. Exactly how long does that last before more adventures happen to him?

I honestly got so fond of Charon in this game, and was really fascinated by his code of conduct. I'd love something exploring Charon's partnership with the Lone Wanderer. Personally, I played a female protag who erred on the side of altruism, but however you play it, he's watching this kid pull off some crazy stuff. What's his perspective?

Westworld (TV) 
William (Westworld)

Okay, I'm going to do my darnedest not to spoil anything for innocent bystanders, so away we go!

William's my favorite character (I love the different facets of him we get to see, his all-consuming need for meaning, and the idea that even virtues can become destructive if taken to extremes) and I'm most interested in his development following his first visit to the park. I'd love to see more of the "real world"--his home life, corporate maneuverings at Delos--and how his perception of these things changes as a result of his time in Westworld. (That said, if you want to write a story that takes place solely in the park, go right ahead.) How does he get from the person he is at the end of his initial arc to the man he'll ultimately become? (You don't have to answer that, obviously--but I'd love to see one of the steps along the way.)

I love William's relationships with Dolores, Lawrence, and Logan, and would also be really interested in learning about his family. But really, include whoever you like--tell me about him meeting Ford for the first time, for instance.

I also really dig the way the show plays with time and memory, so a more experimental approach would be great too! Anything that expands on the ideas or world of the show--there's so much that's hinted at, or just left open to explore--would be phenomenal.

Baby Driver (2017) 
Baby | Miles

So my favorite scene in the movie is the one where Baby's getting coffee. It was such a fascinating glimpse at the way his mind works and the world he inhabits--I'd adore anything that could capture that feeling.

I'm also intrigued by Baby's past (I'm a sucker for childhood flashbacks)--I'd love to read about the first time he met Doc, car-theft-related shenanigans, or a musical discovery he made when he was younger (bonus points if you manage to incorporate car-theft-related shenanigans). His relationship with Joe is wonderful, I'd love anything about them--pre- or post-movie. And if you'd rather write about someone else, go for it!

I also love car chases (go figure) and stories with a strong sense of place, so if you just wanted to write about Baby zipping around Atlanta, I would be absolutely fine with that.

Mad Men 
Don Draper, Sally Draper

Sally is the Mad Men character whose post-finale fate I'm most interested (and invested! please let things turn out moderately okay for her!) in. I'd really love to see how she evolves as a person, and how that affects her relationship (or lack thereof) with Don. I can imagine all kinds of futures for her, and I'd love to read about either one possibility in particular or a five-things-type exploration of different paths she could take. I'm also interested in how she comes to terms with her own past, as well as Don's (what she knows of it--how much does he wind up telling her about himself? is there anything she finds out on her own?).

If futurefic isn't your thing, a Sally-and-Don moment set during the show would be fantastic, too--maybe sometime between seasons 3 and 4 (the first time he sees the kids after the divorce?), or Don sharing something about himself with (or being reminded of something about himself by) her.

Hut 33 

f you can get the humour of this, I will love you and everything about this series. The quasi-Blackadder of it makes me extremely happy, so should you wish to transpose the setting/context Blackadder-style and AU it, that is perfect. Minka delights me, as does Charles, as does everyone, but I'm as happy with a single Archie-perspective read as with a series-style script, so whatever method takes your fancy. I'd love the team to actually succeed at something important, whether by design or mistake, or I'd also be really happy with an improvised festive time with this. Again, more in letter!

As above, really! Again, it's the sheer bloody-minded fun of it amidst the most head-bangingly frustrating characters. I love when Bernard actually has to engage with the art of bookselling, either by buying more books, or doing tax returns, or anything else...I'm imagining him trying to deal with the influx of YA into publishing (perhaps he is an unexpected fan? At the very least he ought to love The Hunger Games), author visits, cardboard promotional material that doesn't fit together properly, the Christmas rush, the very notion that the British public are once more reading and buying books from bookshops...I would love any kind of bookish geekery.

Again, I'm also super here for any weird AU/crossover/crack. I love all the characters, and really, the whole everything

Amelia Peabody - Elizabeth Peters 
Amelia Peabody Emerson, Radcliffe Emerson

Amelia and Emerson are such wonderful characters. I love Amelia’s strength and her foibles, her idiosyncrasies and her fabulously distinct narrative voice, her love for Emerson and her love for archaeology. Meanwhile Emerson’s love for Amelia is so manifestly evident at all times and endearing (plus I love his own archaeological fervor). And their banter, conversational style, working together, arguments, and reconciliations are all so much fun to read about. If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): How about a story about their relationship over the years – perhaps five times Peabody rescued Emerson and one time Emerson rescued Peabody, maybe? (Or vice-versa.) (Five-times fic in general is great.) Or maybe they have an adventure together that didn’t get recorded in the books. Or maybe one of them is writing an article about best archaeological practices and the other provides input. ;) Or perhaps you’d like to write a story from Emerson’s POV (either first-person or third-person is great).

If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :) 

A few prompts (more in my letter): What adventures might Harry and Corlath have together after their marriage? What's Narknon's perspective on their relationship? How might they solve a mystery together? Do they ever visit Ihistan and/or Harry's homeland together? Or what about an AU in which Corlath doesn't kidnap Harry, or an AU in which Harry and Senay are the ones who fall in love?

Tell me a story about Polly! If you already have a plotbunny - or if any of the general likes in my letter inspire one - go for it! I love surprises. :)

A few prompts (more in my letter): What's Miss Snelgrove’s POV of Polly’s career at Townsend Brothers? How might Polly and Eileen have fallen in love? (And did Binnie ever figure it out?)

Jewish Scripture & Legend 
Naomi (Jewish Scripture & Legend), Rut | Ruth (Jewish Scripture & Legend)

Naomi and Ruth are one of my earliest ships. I think Ruth’s speech is one of the most beautiful ever written, and it’s no coincidence that it appears in so many romantic contexts (and is often used in wedding ceremonies). As a young, childless widow of marriageable age, it would have made so much more sense for Ruth to return to her family, as Orpah did. To journey into a foreign land with another widow, without any male support, where they would struggle on the margins of society? (The reason Naomi and her husband had originally left Judah was because there was a famine there, after all.) To cleave to Naomi was a brave choice indeed for Ruth, but she makes it so passionately and with such conviction. Then she supports Naomi by going out to glean, and when she marries Naomi’s relative (with Naomi’s urging) and has a child, does the village say “Boaz has had a son”? No, they say “There is a son born to Naomi,” and Naomi cradles him in her bosom. ♥

While I have no problem with historical detail if that’s what you are excited about writing, I also don’t mind at all if you blur/handwave the historical accuracy (or if you take Ruth and Naomi’s story out of its context entirely, in the case of my AU prompts).

See my letter for specific prompts. :)

Ben 'Light Boy', Johnny (Dare (2005))

I love the ambiguity in this! I love Johnny's badness! His seductiveness! I love the tension! I love how it sort of drops off at such a point where you don't know what would have happened next. Do they return to form, ignoring each other, or even turning hostile? Do they meet again in secret? Can Ben ever get over his lust? Is Johnny capable of being more authentic and true to himself? Could they become friends, or more? There's a push/pull dynamic that's really sexy for such a short piece. I'd love to see a scenario where the tables are turned--where Ben is out and happy with himself, and it's Johnny, still closeted, but envious of Ben's freedom, who makes the first move. I'd love to see Ben string him along a bit. But really, anything more with these two will make me super happy. There's nothing like two hot guys, some ambiguity, and some splashy-sexy times.

They're also gearing up to make a sequel next year, yay! So that's another tack you could take--Jonnny and Ben, years later, meeting up again for a dip in the pool. Is Ben Johnny's dirty little secret? Or do they happen to meet randomly, only for sparks to fly once more?

Would Walsh even seem charming next to a bunch of other Reptilians? What would Ozzie think of Walsh's homeworld? Does Walsh's homeworld even exist anymore? Does Jeff's? What's with the cover memories involving deer? And what made them choose deer? What other fun-sexy advanced technology to aliens have access to? Why does Walsh prefer his human suit? Oh, or what if they ended up on Jonathan's homeworld and Ozzie had to pretend to be his slave/pet/boyfriend/husband/boss? What if, according to Reptilian status markers, Jonathan's considered a real nobody because he has to work on Earth? What if they get to ~Reptileworld and Ozzie's super popular for some reason? Or what if Jonathan's actually capable of babies? Go wild, I say! This is the canon for just about anything. :) 

And I love the whole cast, so though I'd love Jonathan and Ozzie (and Jonathan/Ozzie), feel free to have fun with everyone else. More of Don's lightning-fast processing of emotions, more of Nancy's random feminism, more of Yvonne's weapons EVERYWHERE. Just--moar, please!

Suikoden III 

Suikoden 3 is my favorite RPG of all time in terms of its worldbuilding. The realistic qualities of the world, in both the overall plot and the small details - racist innkeepers! Real, serious emotional trauma from war! An alliance that is fragile and, ultimately, broken! - still fascinate me, despite the game being 16 years old. What I'm most interested in seeing is what canon teases but, ultimately, denies us - a chance to see the future, past Suikoden III. I'm particularly interested in how the characters have grown and changed in the tumultuous, war-ravaged world. How does Chris cope with the war with Tinto, especially with things as fragile as they are in the Grasslands? How does Zexen as a whole deal with their Knight Captain never aging, eternally youthful? How do Thomas and/or Cecile hold on to Budehuc - or do they not, and are left desperately trying to find a place that would accept them? How would Chris feel to see an older Thomas and Cecile as soldiers signing on for a war? How does Geddoe feel about how things are left in the Grassland? Does anything change in his troops after his friends find out his true origins? 

In terms of ships, I would prefer Thomas/Cecile. I tend to ship Chris with Salone and Geddoe with Queen, but I am alright with gen for any of the four nominated characters as well but would prefer not to see the character(s) in other ships. (Past relationships is fine.)

The Good Place (TV) 

The Good Place is a show that has come and absolutely stolen my heart this season. I absolutely adore the characters, the setting, and the mythology of the show. I'm most interested in an exploration of how things change over the many, many times Michael has wiped the Main 4's memories - how do they handle it when they get deja vu? How do the demons handle having to keep their stories straight time and time again? Does Trevor come in to assist? What happens to those who Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani/Jason left behind? Does Jason ever get corrupted from how much Michael is rebooting her? Will Janet and Jason ever fall in love again? Has Janet ever figured out she is in hell? How does the soul-mate switch up affect the crew over those many reboots? What was the magic panda? Did the Seduce Michael plan actually work?  How long have they been in hell, anyway?

I'm staying current on the show so please do not worry about spoilers. In terms of ships, I basically ship the entire cast with one another, but I'm especially fond of Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Michael. Would not say no to pretty much any combination of the main 4 + Janet/Michael/Trevor. No problem with demon or computer/human. Am also open to gen for any.

Atomic Blonde (2017) 
Lorraine Broughton, Emmett Kurzfeld, Delphine Lasalle

I quite liked Atomic Blonde in theaters this year. I'm all for spy on spy action, and the canonical femslash pleased me greatly. I'm mostly looking for fic playing on the lack of trust inherent in these relationships; how do you trust anyone, or love anyone, in a time so bleak as the cold war? What makes them want to be spies? Are they loyal to their countries? One another? Why was the CIA double-crossing the British? Why was Lorraine a triple agent? Was Delphine a baby spy, or was there more to her than how she presented herself? 

In terms of ships, I would love Kurtzfeld/Lorraine or Delphine/Lorraine but I am open to gen as well.

Suicide Squad (2016) 
Harleen Quinzel (Suicide Squad (2016)), Floyd Lawton (Suicide Squad 2016)

I loved Suicide Squad. It's so cartoonishly grimy and fun and I love the idea of these villains not only getting a hero turn in some cases but also showing that they're not, entirely, their bad actions. In particular, I thought Floyd/Deadshot being both a murderous killer <i>and</i> a very dedicated father was a really interesting turn on his character; I also enjoyed seeing Harley's secret desire being having a family with the Joker, so naturally what I'd <i>really</i> like to see is Harley/Deadshot with a family focus. How would they get together? How would Harley react to Deadshot's daughter? What would happen when the Joker or Batman got word of this? 

I only want Deadshot/Harley in terms of pairings, but I'm open to them having been with other people in the past. I'm also fine with villains being villains, or if you want to make them turn over a new leaf, that's fine too. I'm just interested in the journey.

Crazyhead (TV) 
Raquel Francis, Suzanne (Crazyhead), Amy (Crazyhead)

Crazyhead is a show that's so short but <i>so good</i>! I'm a huge fan of the entire female cast and would love more adventures together, especially post-canon since it doesn't seem like we'll ever see a Season 2. How did Suzanne come back to life after throwing herself out of the window? How do Raquel and Amy patch up their relationship after the distrust and the drugging etc? Are the demons still gunning for them, now that Callum is gone? 

I love any combination of the main three here, whether it's gen or shippy.

NieR: Automata (Video Game) 
2B (NieR: Automata), 9S (NieR: Automata), A2 (NieR: Automata), Anemone (NieR: Automata)

NieR is a game I didn't think would punch me as hard in the feels as it did. I'm really fascinated by its androids, still fighting an endless war for the sake of and against a people that no longer exist. Mostly I feel terrible for the main cast, who are all so traumatized. A part of me wants happier fluff, and another part of me wants to revel in sadness, so whether fluff or dark-fic, you'll make me happy. Mostly I'm looking for the connections between the characters nominated - How do their relationships grow and change, especially with so much going on around them? How does 2B react to killing 9S and seeing him, again and again and again? How does Anemone react to re-meeting A2? How does Anemone see the YorHa units - or  A2? How does 9S start to see the world once his sanity starts slipping - particularly 2B, A2, and Anemone? 

In terms of ships, I prefer 2B/9S and A2/Anemone, but I am open to gen for all as well.

What I'd really love is a story where Duncan and Owen make out, could be that summer - Duncan's never been kissed, and wants to practice before he tries it on Susanna - or Duncan could come back to work another summer at the park. I also really love the found family vibe of the park employees, and would be into some sort of "it takes a village to raise a child" story about Caitlin and her baby.

Northern Exposure 
Chris Stevens, Ed Chigliak, Holling Vincoeur, Shelly Tambo

I would really love something that goes even more into the magical realism of the show (double, triple the strange magical things! Go full-out Night Vale! Actually going full-out Night Vale with it is something I would be SUPER into). Character-wise, if you wanted to get kind of epistolary with Chris - like radio show excerpts mixed into the narrative - that would be amazing. I would also be excited about a Chris/Ed of any sort, gen Chris+Ed having some sort of adventure (maybe a road trip?), or Shelly/Holling just because I find them adorable together.

The Birds (1963) 
Annie Hayworth, Melanie Daniels

I saw this for the first time a few months ago and thought, "I need fix-it fic where Mitch dies instead of Annie, and Annie goes with Melanie at the end." This could be Annie+Melanie friendship, or Annie/Melanie. (Sorry, Mitch, it's not like you're horrible or anything but I was annoyed that Annie died saving your sister.) Other ideas: I didn't nominate Mitch, but if you felt like writing Annie/Melanie/Mitch, I would be down with that. Or any of the tropes listed in my letter, really, as long as Annie doesn't die!

2) Reuben's "I have some remaindered furniture I want to send you" screams sugar daddy to me. Please tell me more about his relationships with Danny and Rusty when they were younger. Platonic or sexual/romantic, it doesn't matter to me.
3) "the thing with the guy in the place" - What did Danny and Rusty do for Reuben in Belize? Maybe only Rusty had to go to Belize for the thing, and Danny was doing his part somewhere else? Did they con someone, steal something, or maybe steal something back? I doubt Reuben is one to tell people he owes them lightly, so it must have really been something.

Really, if you're not entirely comfortable writing the Napoleonic era version of these guys, an AU of any sort would be great. (How about Jack Aubrey as Danny Ocean? I'm only slightly joking.) Either Jack/Stephen or Jack+Stephen as friends devoted to each other works for me, and if you'd also like to include Diana that would also be cool.

Chronicles of Amber - Roger Zelazny 
Corwin (Chronicles of Amber), Deirdre (Chronicles of Amber)

I'm very fond of Corwin as narrator and in general, and I really wished we could have gotten more of Deirdre than canon gave us (and I hate only realizing I ship something when one half abruptly dies!) so I would be delighted to receive a story that focuses on them, or on one of them with the other in a supporting role. With all those centuries, even before Corwin's stint as an amnesiac on Earth there's a lot of time canon didn't cover or barely glossed over in which adventures, learning experiences and heartbreaks must have been happening. 

I would rather not receive a story focusing heavily on Deirdre's canonical death-- stories set before then or handwaving it would be my preference at this time.

Gen or het with their current/past partners is fine.

I don't see these two in a romantic light, and I don't see either one as they type to cheat on their mates. But if they happened to meet before they were mated, then I could see them having a fling. Nothing serious, though, and I think it would largely be about the two of them testing one another for dominance. Or possibly Asil testing Bran (somehow I see Asil as younger, but who even knows if that's true).

Ensemble/general prompts: The first meeting between any of them. John has new drugs for everyone to try, leading to singing or nakedness or adventures. A roadtrip lecture tour, with all the joys of Victorian travel. One or more of them meets the Quacks-version of another famous Victorian. Sharing wildly over the top stories about what they did during the war. Caroline and Robert's wedding night, which goes as well as expected. They're invited to a party at Nicola's new house. The zombie apocalypse happens, and none of them are taking it as seriously as they should. It's Christmas and there might be ghosts, but it could just be drugs.

Hark! A Vagrant 
Dr. Sara Josephine Baker (Hark! A Vagrant)

I agonized over whether to nominate this under Hark! A Vagrant (which is, after all, the only reason I ever found out about Dr. Sara Josephine Baker in the first place) or as some kind of RPF fandom (since it's the real-life details from her wikipedia page that REALLY ignited my interest in a possible yuletide story!). In the end I decided to nominate under Hark! A Vagrant mostly because I didn't feel like I could come up with a sensible RPF category/label. :-P

So! IN ADDITION to all the awesome public health accomplishments of Dr. Baker that we learn about in the comic, wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Josephine_Baker#Personal_life) also tells me that she lived with two other women, one of whom 'identified as a "woman-oriented woman."' !!!!!  So naturally I'm interested in the possibility of a Sarah Josephine Baker/Ida Alexa Ross Wylie/Louise Pearce threesome (in whatever romantic/sexual/platonic configuration may be pleasing to you to write :-)).

I'm not an expert on the relevant history or anything--I pretty much just know what's in the comic and the wikipedia page--so, uh, don't feel any need to be any more "historically accurate" than the comic itself. :-P If you want to go for the same kind of tone as the comic, that's cool! If you are a secret expert in the history, I will admire! If you'd be interested in exploring some other kind of setting or approach entirely (ex.: lesbian public health doctor in SPAAAAAACE)--also cool!

Beautiful Losers II - Jack Vettriano 
Woman (Beautiful Losers II), Standing Man (Beautiful Losers II), Seated Man (Beautiful Losers II)

You can see this artwork here! https://www.jackvettriano.com/exhibitions/lovers-strangers/beautiful-losers-ii-3/

This picture just tells such a story, doesn't it? I'd love to see more of it. :-)

Threesomes are my jam. This doesn't necessarily *have to* be a sexy threesome story, but that would be very welcome if you are so inclined! Whether they're already all three in an established relationship together, or a couple bringing in a friend as a third (and if so, which pair are the couple!), or some other possibility is up to you. I do have a fondness for some degree of established relationship--the comfortableness with each other that that can bring--but I have certainly also read reams of fanfic about first times, so I'm not exactly opposed to that, either. :-)

I will say, from the body language it seems like the woman might not be entirely happy to be there... but I do prefer my threesomes happy, or at least in overall happy relationships even if the immediate situation isn't happy. Maybe she could be upset about something else, and they could be comforting her? Or something else--you don't need to feel wedded to the idea that she's unhappy at all--I just wanted to mention my take on what seemed like it might be an obvious interpretation of the picture.

Request 4 by Age or Wizardry (ageorwizardry)
Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Marge Sherwood

Consider Marge. Consider how Marge is absolutely right about Tom Ripley in the end. Consider how no one will believe her because the old boys' club would rather draw together to protect even someone who murdered one of its own sons than take a woman seriously. Consider Marge returning home from Europe, grieving, betrayed. Consider what she does next. Consider how she picks the pieces of her life back up again.

Consider the book she's been writing since before she ever met Tom Ripley, or even Dickie Greenleaf. Consider what kind of book she might be working on, what work she would consider so important—and take it seriously, because she does, even if no one else does. Consider whether the direction of her work would change after her experiences in Europe, and if so, how.

Consider her eventually being vindicated about the nature of Tom Ripley. Or, alternately, consider her living so well that he recedes ever smaller in the rear-view mirror of her life.

Consider Marge.

And then tell me something about her.

This request is primarily based on the movie, but I have read the books as well (although it was several years ago now). Feel free to incorporate or disregard anything you wish from the books—for instance, we know what Marge's book is about in the books, but there's no need for that to be the same in the movie/your story, unless you want it to be.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) 
Bella (Hunt for the Wilderpeople)

I really enjoyed this movie, but I was disappointed that it was Yet Another Story whose plot was kicked off by a woman's death. I'd love to see an AU where Bella didn't die--and whether their ordinary lives continue together on the upward trend you could expect, or they still (somehow??) manage to wind up in some of the wacky adventures they have in the movie is up to you. Or pre-movie Bella backstory--or whatever takes your fancy! I'd just love for Bella to have more room to breathe in a story that doesn't treat her as expendable.

The Alexandria Archives (Podcast) 
Morning Wood (Alexandria Archives), Gore (Alexandria Archives)

If you're new to this fandom, the Alexandria Archives is a fun cute podcast that's basically a college AU of the Cthulhu Mythos (alexandriaarchives.com) and it's an easy listen if you'd like to check it out!

I really like Morning Wood but I hate her DJ call name so I'd love something explaining it or telling us what MW's real name is, haha.

I'd also be pleased with a day in the life of Gore, vampire, not really on campus. What does he do with his days (or nights?) What's up with his "Canadian" roommate? How is he doing shaking off his ex? When we last left her she seemed a bit jealous of MW — although also they both liked each other. Does she have a reason to be jealous? (I'd love MW/Gore if you're so inclined!)

Alternately anything exploring the school and its background and its cast of creepy characters and landmarks would be great. You can build on any of the story-within-a-story of the individual eps (that first episode with the sever room, for example!!!! or the SWAMP), or follow any of the other characters around — really, it's all good!

Once on this Island - Flaherty/Ahrens 

I love this musical, it's one of my all-time favorites, and I'd love absolutely anything you chose to do with the mythology, the worldbuilding, or any of the characters! Want to turn all the characters into plants? Be my guest! Want to explore the antics of the gods and goddesses? Great. Want to show a conversation between Timoune and Papa Ge as she bargains to keep her life? Perfect. Want to explore what happens to the girl and boy at the end of the story who are set free by Timoune's sacrifice to love and unite the island? I would be overjoyed. &lt;3333 Even if you just want to do a look at the customs and the traditions of the people on the island, or a character study, or something experimental, or anything that's not particularly plotty — seriously, anything. I'd be delighted.

I feel like I ask for this fandom every other year I've done Yuletide, haha, and I really just would love it if someone else who loves it too comes along and cares to extend a lovely story and/or a gorgeous fascinating universe a bit further.

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

So basically I just want Alex and Dr. Strand fighting and fucking, in no particular order.

But, it would be a cool bonus if Alex has to actually deal with the conflict of interest she courts by falling in love with the subject of her reporting, because the extent to which she's willing to muddy personal/ethical lines on this show drives me crazy, haha.

Also another thing that drives me crazy about this show is the extent to which it has inverted the concepts of 'open-mindedness' and 'skepticism' by having Alex constantly comment that she is skeptical of the ability with which Strand easily explains away things she herself doesn't understand. That! is not! how skepticism works! He is easily dismissive of things because there's no practical/physical/tangible evidence for them which is the essence of skepticism; you don't get to be skeptical of a skeptic's skepticism when you are only basing your own observations on "but i saw X happen with my own eyes" even if it is scary and impressive and convincing! and, like, oh my god, this drives me batty. I just want him to like explain the scientific method to her until she gets it. Maybe while eating her out.

Alternately, i would love to see more of *her* skepticism and critical thinking on display, maybe in a follow-up to the end of S2? But in the end, I'm really not picky about the details or where in the timeline it takes place; I just really want Alex and Dr. Strand fucking and fighting, in no particular order. :D

Early Edition 
Gary Hobson, Marissa Clark, Toni Brigatti, Zeke Crumb

NOTE: Though I've requested all four nominated characters, with this character set I'm fine with you leaving one or two of them out, or giving one or two of the characters less screentime than your main focus. Gary and Marissa are my OTBFFs, Gary/Toni = OTP of my 14-year-old heart, and Crumb interacting with any or all of those three is always gold. The fact that the show never had Toni and Marissa together for more than three forking seconds is a damn tragedy. So seriously, any combination will work.

I'll always love a story in which Gary and Marissa negotiate how to take care of the paper and run the bar and have personal lives while being occasionally exasperated BFFs (while, meanwhile, Crumb both does and does not want to know how Gary predicts the future). I would never object to bantery romance and/or sexytimes between Gary and Toni. You could give them all a paper-based problem or one of Toni's or Crumb's cases to tackle (or a heist!) if you want to go with something plotty. 

DNWs are rape and non-consensual sex, abuse or serious harm of children, graphic violence, major character death, and depictions of real-life tragedies. See my letter for more details and prompts.

In Plain Sight 
Mary Shannon, Marshall Mann

Partnership is the best ship, and US Marshals make for fascinating partners. I would love an episodic story about Mary and Marshall and one or more of their witnesses getting into and/or out of trouble, an exploration of a trope like a road trip, bed sharing, trapped in a small space, or even an AU like a noir detective story or a time loop fic. I also would not object to a fix-it fic that repairs the damage the finale did to their friend/partner ship. Whether or not you want to make them romantic partners is up to you—I'm okay with them being BFFs forever, or with their friendship growing into something more romantic.

Feel free to include other characters from the show if you'd like, especially Stan, but I'd prefer the focus be on Mary and Marshall.

What was she like as a child; what stories did she imagine and play at with her brothers? How did Neverland change her? What pearl does she make of the bit of grit left in her by her adventure there? Can she fly without Peter's help afterward? Does she find her way back to Neverland, or to other imaginary realms as she grows up? Does she grow up and work for the better world she can imagine? Go as wildly off-canon as you want for this request and do whatever you want to give Wendy a better, happier story.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Bedivere (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I don't need all three characters to appear together, just any two! My letter has general likes, as well as a Arthur/Mage smut prompt, if you want more details than are in these prompts.

Arthur &amp; Bedivere: Bedivere comparing Arthur to Uther, developing respect between the two of them. Sparring? Would not be opposed to past Bedivere/Uther and how that affects Bedivere’s interactions with Arthur.

Bedivere &amp; The Mage: Bedivere knew who she was/that she was coming. What did he know? How did he know she was coming? What were those first weeks like, as they were planning the rescue? How did the Mage settle into the rebellion?

Bedivere &amp; Arthur &amp; The Mage: some early Table difficulties! I can see Bedivere and the Mage being the most important advisors to Arthur as he’s getting started, since Bedivere was in charge of the rebellion and was a high ranking knight in Uther’s army and the Mage is obviously an expert in a field with not a lot of experts. Something about Bedivere’s experience with the Dark Lands and him telling the two of them about it? 

Arthur/Mage, SFW: He let her bite him with a snake. What else would he let her do? Any explorations of that trust, or post-movie anything about her getting a seat at the Table would be great.

General likes and smut prompts are in my letter. Otherwise, here are a few of my prompts!

Dorothy/Lucas: during or post-canon, or canon-AU. I’m still peeved that Dorothy wasn’t the Beast Forever, so anything that switched that up so she is would be greatly appreciated! The return to Oz, the awkward first night. Lucas’ thoughts while he’s strung up. Anything, really!

West/Tip: anything to do with assuming the throne and having to be Ozma when he’s in public, West as the loyal right hand witch.

Dorothy &amp; West: witchy bonding? magic worldbuilding?

Tip &amp; Lucas: Did Tip send Lucas to retrieve Dorothy? I’d love to see how that went down. Did Lucas ask to be sent after Dorothy? Was West the one who sent him?

Lucas &amp; West: this is kind of a wildcard to me! did they know each other pre-series? how does West feel about Glinda’s hypocrisy in having a husband? do Lucas and West bond over being happiest when they have someone to serve?

General DNWs: on-screen/gratuitous/explicit rape, trauma to eyes or teeth, pregnancy, kid-fic, de-aging, crack, mpreg, A/B/O, kink treated like part of the structure of the world, mundane AUs, Christmas

General likes and some smut prompts are in my letter. I would love to read about Anderson playing off of any other character, so I've only requested her, but would be happy to have her interacting with anyone! And if you just want to Anderson on her own, I'd love case-fic! Her first case by herself, maybe? Or her backstory/the discovery of her powers/her time in Academy?

Anderson &amp; MaMa: Anderson doesn’t believe in ghosts but Madeline Madrigal haunts her all the same. Is it guilt? A psychic imprint of her last moments? Up to you!

Anderson &amp; Dredd: case-fic, or post-case fic. Patching up each other’s wounds. Dealing with psychic migraines during a case. Being teamed up together after a while apart and Dredd’s unsurprised and (seemingly) unimpressed at how much Anderson’s improved because he totally expected her to but she wants him to be proud anyway and doesn’t realize that he is?

Anderson &amp; Clan Techie: I’d be interested in a follow-up – how do they think about each other? if you want this to be shippy, i’m not opposed, but I’m thinking more along the lines of Anderson had to do a lot of killing, and the Techie is one person she was able to save, and the Techie probably remembers her. Do they meet again? Do they want to? this would be a more introspective fic, i think, though i’d love it if you could work it around action/daily life. I don’t think there’s a lot of time to stop and think and decompress in Mega City One.

Legion (TV) 
David Haller

Gen or any pairings are fine!

- What the fuck happened to David after the season finale?? Whose weird floaty metal ball prison thing was that and where did it take him?

- Division 3 can't be the only ones out there investigating and experimenting on mutants. How about a classic X-Men mutants-on-the-run kind of story but with this group of weirdos with mostly impractical abilities.

- David has the potential to do amazingly fucked up shit with his powers. What happens when he discovers his true potential? What if he enjoys the power a bit too much? Maybe he decides he can compromise with the Shadow King instead of defeat him, or maybe David consumes Farouk and loses control with their combined power. Just how much damage can he cause and is he even aware that he's doing it?

- David meets his father. I actually can't imagine what would happen if this version of David met either movie version of Xavier, but I love the idea of two of the strongest mutants in this universe - a father and son who don't even know each other - finally meeting. I figure either shit will go horribly wrong and/or they'll find a way to work things out.

Sense8 (TV) 
Lito Rodriguez, Sun Bak, Will Gorski, Wolfgang Bogdanow

I only requested a few characters, but I'm happy with any of the cluster, any pairings, any rating level. Feel free to bring in any of the supporting cast too, but I'd prefer the focus be on at least one of the cluster. I'm good with happily ever after or something more melancholy - including outright tragedy. I'm not interested in exploring issues of real world discrimination, but sensorium vs humans would be cool. 

- How the cluster rescues Wolfgang. The season finale was fucking brutal and I want to know what the rest of their mad plan was to get Wolfgang back.

- Or if you want to break my heart (go for it!), maybe they fail and the cluster has to deal with losing one of their own. How do eight become seven (or fewer)? Hell, go all out and give me the last sensate standing, alone, without their cluster (and then my family will wonder why I'm crying on Christmas and I'll babble about beautiful tragic fanfic).

- Winter holidays with the cluster! If you're in the mood for something fluffier, I love holidays and people coming together as families of different stripes. Even if they're a world apart and come from very different traditions and religions. One of my favorite things about the show is how often they celebrate with each other: all different kinds of events and festivals where they're there for one another.

- Some ideas focused on specific characters: Sun gets her revenge, one way or another. Lito becomes the movie star he was meant to be, with Hernando and Daniela at his side. Nomi and Amanita's wedding goes off with a bang. Will and Riley rebuild their lives. Capheus climbs the political ladder, for good or ill. Wolfgang figures the best way to deal with all this organized crime nonsense is to either control it all or wash his hands of it forever, with or without Kala.

- The world thinks both Matt Murdock and the Devil of Hell's Kitchen are dead. How does anyone come back from this? In other words, either about the Defenders moving on without him or literally about his return from the supposed dead.

- Matt and Jessica are the best snarky assholes. They decide to put their respective skills to good use together to save a person/their fiends/the city. Eye rolling and ass kicking ensue. I'm imagining gen here, but I'm open to being sold on them ending up in bed together (I can totally picture Jessica mocking the devil costume while trying to get Matt out of it)!

- You can't punch your way out of all fights, but it's kind of the only thing the Defenders know how to do.

- Jessica and Luke eventually figure their shit out and that they are best together. [Note: I love Claire but I find Luke/Claire not very exciting so I'd ask that you break them up kindly.]

- Luke/Danny porn. Against a wall, over furniture, grabbing, biting. Super strength/invulnerability meets harnessed qi. Most likely awkward and rough, but maybe something they both need. Feel free to throw Matt in here too, why not. 

Do Not Wants: D/s, mundane/modern AUs, kidfic, pregnancy, incest, 2nd person POV, soulbonds/soulmates, jealousy, A/B/O, spanking, issuefic.

Goon (2011) 
Xavier LaFlamme, Doug Glatt

There just isn't that much shippy fic about these two - I'm all in for fluffy romance or smut, I'm not fussy.  I haven't included Eva as a required character but I am happy for her to be included in a poly triad or full on OT3 or not as the filler chooses.

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 
Corran Horn (Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types)

This was my very first fandom and I fondly recall reading fanfic of it back in the day but so little seems to have survived.  Corran was always my favourite character and I'd love to read anything involving him, especially anything during the events of the Allston books when the canonical focus moves to the Wraiths - we get a couple of anecdotes about Corran but it would be good to read more.  Or anything involving his recovery from being held on the Lusankya, which gets glossed over in the books.

Washington Capitals RPF 
Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

Backstrom is my favourite player on the Caps - he doesn't get the limelight like some other players but he's always there getting the job done.  I would probably be happy with anything involving him but something shippy with another Caps player would be great.  I don't have a long list of DNW but must have a happy ending, no ongoing infidelity or bashing of real life relationships and no non-hockey AUs.  I'm totally good with ABO and similar type AUs and I absolutely love magical realism done with these guys.

Vegas Golden Knights RPF 
Marc-Andre Fleury (Vegas Golden Knights RPF), James Neal (Vegas Golden Knights RPF)

As sad as am I for Flower to have left the Penguins, at least Vegas seem to have got off to a good start.  Since Flower and Neal have been reunited in Vegas and both seem to be starting off hot, I'd love a story about them helping each other adjust.  Would be happy with gen but something of a more shippy, or even smutty nature, would be great.  If smutty, would prefer if real life relationships were acknowledged but no cheating (open relationship, one-off agreement, or whatever).  I love the narrative about Flower being a prankster and references to this would be an added bonus.  I just want fic which shows him settling into Vegas and being happy there - he deserves it.

The Bold Type 
Jane Sloan, Ryan Decker

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

The Bold Type (Jane Sloan &amp; Ryan Decker)
I let friends and a barrage of Facebook ads talk me into starting this show and I fell in love with it, and with Jane Sloan specifically. I love that things scare her and embarrass her, but she does them anyway (and then writes something honest and heartfelt about it). I love her friendship with Kat and Sutton, so feel free to include them and any other characters from the show in your fic. I like Ryan, hence my requesting him, but the TBT really only shows him from Jane’s point of view, so I have a hard time really pinning him down. 

I really enjoy the two of them together, and would love to receive a fic that involves the two of them giving a serious, exclusive relationship a try. Jane clearly has a certain idea about what Ryan is looking for from a woman, but she hasn’t given him much of a chance to prove otherwise (nor has he put much effort into getting one). But what if he did want to date Jane seriously, and only date her? It seems like he at least entertained the idea. I’m sure there would be some missteps along the way, but I’d love to see them put in the effort. Maybe they have to go separate ways for a while, but run into each other years down the line and find that the attraction’s still there. Do they give it another go? Or do they give casual another shot, only to eventually find they want to be less casual, and then try to broach the topic again?

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

General dislikes: 1st/2nd person point of view, focus on non-canon pregnancy/children, non-canon character death, explicit sex, rape/noncon, incest, graphic violence, gore, character bashing. Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Call the Midwife  (Trixie Franklin &amp; Christopher Dockerill)
I forget how I started watching this show, but I’ve watched the last few seasons over long weekends with my mother. I love the historical aspect (fashion! medical breakthroughs! the horrible trauma of a generation that survived World War II!), as well as the focus on women and all the different types of relationships that they have. It took me a season or two to warm up to Trixie, but as we’ve gotten to see more sides of her I’ve come to love the vulnerability that she hides under her perfectly applied eyeliner. I’ve been hoping she’ll get some sort of happy ending since she broke off her engagement to Tom, and I like the idea of Christopher being that for her. Neither one of them was entirely forthcoming about their pasts at the start of their relationship, but it was to avoid getting hurt (and in Christopher’s case, also to avoid his daughter getting hurt).

Please, please, please give me a happy ending (or middle) for these two. Whether it’s a sweet holiday interlude (I love the show’s Christmas episodes, but I’m also in for any other holiday), or something that has them both opening up a little more about their pasts (Trixie’s childhood and alcoholism, and Christopher’s divorce), and not letting that get in the way of their future. I’d love to see more of Trixie getting used to the idea of being in a relationship with a man who has a child. Trixie was really great with Alexandra during their first meeting, but things aren’t always that easy or pleasant when there’s a child involved. Alternately, I think there could be a lot to explore by having Christopher be formally introduced to the rest of the nuns and midwives. I love all of the canon pairings on the show, so feel free to include them, but I’d like the focus to be on Trixie and Christopher.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Emerald City  (Dorothy Gale &amp; Lucas/Roan)
Oh man, this show sucked me in from the first episode and I was so sad to hear that it was canceled. I love tv shows/books/movies that take a well-known story and twist it up, and this was no exception. At the start, Dorothy was so clearly thrown off-kilter by being sent to a world with completely different rules than her own, but she learned to play by them and play by them well. I also love how emotional she could be. When something affected her, it was clear for everyone to see.

For this fandom, I’d like to see something that picks up where the show left off. I think there’s so much to explore there, with Dorothy returning to Oz and also being around Lucas/Roan again. Something that shows them trying to figure out where they stand with each other now would be much appreciated. They were lovers and they were enemies, and they very nearly killed each other. How do they reconcile that? Is he Lucas or is Roan or is he some combination of both of them now? Where are his loyalties now? Can they trust each other? So much of their relationship is completely up in the air and can go down so many different paths. It’s exciting to think about. I also really loved both of their relationships with Sylvie, so feel free to include her.

Orphan Island - Laurel Snyder (Abigail)
I am a children’s librarian and I read this book for a committee I’m on at work. I wouldn’t say that I like the way it was open ended and mysterious, but I loved the book and the unanswered questions have definitely been circling around in my head since I finished. I will give Laurel Snyder a lot of credit, because usually books like this annoy me rather than intrigue me.

So I’d love to have your take any of the many unanswered questions. Who was Abigail, where was she from, and what happened to her? How did the first children end up on the Island? Where to the children start out from before coming to the Island, and where do they end up afterwards? Is there a purpose to the Island? How does the Island manage to provide the children with everything they need (at least until it’s rules are broke, and then how does it know the rules have been broken)? I know I requested Abigail, but if you’d like to focus on any other character or just give me worldbuilding, you do not need to include her.

Provost's Dog - Tamora Pierce 
Sabine of Macayhill (Provost's Dog)

General Likes: worldbuilding, fics that focus on the relationships between characters (be they romantic/platonic/familial/adversarial/etc.), backstory, slice of life, future fic, pining, happy endings, holiday fic (winter holidays, universe-specific holidays, or otherwise).

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Provost’s Dog - Tamora Pierce (Sabine)
I’ve been reading Tamora Pierce’s books since I was a kid, and about two years ago I did a re-read of everything she’s written. I wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the Provost’s Dog trilogy when it originally came out, but the second time around I got so much out of it. As an adult, I loved seeing the Tortall of the past, as well as all these events/trends/movements/etc that created the Tortall we see in Pierce’s other books.

Sabine in particular is a great example of this. We tend to think that as time moves forward society gets more progressive, but Sabine is a lady knight in a society that is becoming more narrow in its gender roles. It would be fantastic to receive something that explores that more. How does the Cult of Gentle Mother affect her life as a knight, or even her life farther down the line when she’s put down her sword? How does it affect women knights as a whole? Alternately, something that shows Sabine processing/recovering from Tunstall’s betrayal and coming to terms with the inequality he saw in their relationship would be wonderful, as would something showing her relationships with Bekah and/or Clary in the wake of this.

Also, I’m not really interested in receiving AUs for Yuletide this year ( with 1 exception mentioned under Wayward Children).

Wayward Children series - Seanan McGuire (any)
Oh man, I was in love with this series from the moment I first read a description. And then I was completely awed by Seanan McGuire’s handling of it, especially in regards to the worlds she created for these children to have spent time in. I found every character in this tagset so interesting, and they each have so much about them to be explored, so whoever it was that you offered and whoever it is that you ended up writing about, I’m sure I’ll love it. I’m not really interested in anything shippy with regards to this series (I don’t think I really have ships for this series), so feel free to have any characters interacting in any way. Also, this is my first time requesting ‘any’ in an exchange, so I’m sorry if I’m explaining things I shouldn’t or not explaining things that I should.

Some ideas: We’ve seen/heard in first person what Nancy and the twins’ worlds were like, so I’d love to see or hear more about where Loriel, Christopher, Eleanor, and Kade went. That could be done set in their first trips to those worlds, or because one of them finds a portal back, or whatever interests you. I’d also love to see an alternate universe in which Loriel does make it back to her world. We know the Spider Queen mourned her for a long time; what was their relationship like? What happens to Jack, Jill, and/or Nancy now that they’re back in the worlds they longed for? Is it different now that things are permanent, now that they have a more concrete understanding of where they are and how they got there and where they were from?

Hello author! I'm out of the country without good internet access until Oct 23rd, so I will probably not be able to get a proper author's letter up until then (sorry!!). However, I've requested RW in previous Yuletides and nothing in those letters will change significantly (including dnws), so if you want to start working off those it's perfectly fine by me!

Mary mother of Jesus had a hard life to live. Tell me about that. Tell me about her relationships with her son and with the women (including the song's narrator) who supported her.

Alternately: "slivers of the goddess that they never let us see" is the line that most strikes me in this song. In a polytheistic world, where apotheosis is not unheard of (and may well be how Mary's mortal son got to be a god in the first place), who was Mary, and who did she become?

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Erasmus (Captive Prince), Torveld (Captive Prince)

The Captive Prince series is freaking amazing. So many feels! Erasmus should get all the hugs and comfort he wants; he seriously deserves to be happy, and Torveld is the kind of master who would treat him well and actually care. Erasmus and Torveld were just so sweet together when they showed up, even if we didn't get to see enough of them in canon. How are they going to feel about what happened in Kings Rising when they find out about everything? How will post-canon political changes affect their relationship? Missing (sexy, if you’re into that) scenes from during the canon timeline would be cool, too. :) Please no Erasmus/Kallias except as something that happened in the past.

I’d be happy if Damen and Laurent showed up in disguise somehow, if that’s something you wanted to do and it made any sense at all with the plot. An exception to my crossdressing DNW is crossdressing disguises, which are fun and also canon here. Charls showing up would also be welcome if you’re into that. Speaking of fun canon things, anything with Erasmus' musical talent would be great, too. I bet Torveld would be totally into it if Erasmus wrote him a song. ^_^

Shades of Magic - V. E. Schwab 
Holland Vosijk, Kell Maresh

The world!! Actually, the world<i>s</i>. I love the worldbuilding and magic in this series. I want more of it! There’s so much to explore when you have four Londons: this series has dimension-hopping <i>and</i> people with enough angst to fill multiple universes. Both the characters and the universe(s) themselves are just super-compelling. I so haven’t seen enough of Kell or Holland yet, and I definitely haven’t seen enough of them interacting. I ship those two a lot. They have a fascinating dynamic where they’re antagonistic and have completely different viewpoints but can’t help relating to each other on some level because they’re the last <i>Antari</i> left. Also fascinating is the potential to (mis)use <i>Antari</i> magic for sexy purposes. (It’s a very “your mileage may vary” kink, but I’d totally be into magic-enabled bloodplay here.) 

Being <i>Antari</i> seems to mean being a complete mess, psychologically. With great power comes great angst! Especially with <i>A Conjuring of Light</i>. It was awesome getting to see Holland and Kell working together, but that ending was so sad! I would be more than happy if you came up with an alternate ending where neither of them was damaged by that Inheritor (I knew it was going to be bad when it showed up!) and Holland doesn’t die. Please no Kell/Lila, and I’d prefer Lila not show up.

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Hiraga Josef Kou, Lauren Di Luca, Roberto Nicholas

I’m not even sure how to describe the show, but Scooby Doo: Vatican Edition is one alternate title I saw, and it’s totally appropriate. It could also be called WTF Vatican: The Show. It’s total cracky fun. So many wild plot twists of the “did that actually happen? Yes, it did,” variety. I don’t know how sensible the IT dungeon is (yes there’s what can only be described as the Vatican IT Dungeon), but it’s sure fun. Amidst all the crack and WTF plots, there’s a lot of heartfelt feelings, too. Heartfelt feelings and more cocaine than you might expect for a show about priests (who are basically married or want to be, in my eyes - Lauren is <i>so</i> very jealous of Roberto and Hiraga).

I just love the way Hiraga and Roberto work together and bounce off each other and obviously care about each other. I also love the idea of Lauren’s frustrated, bitter crush on Hiraga. And Lauren’s interactions with Roberto. Casefic would be awesome, and so would anything hurt/comfort. There’s so much potential for feelings between Roberto and Hiraga and also physical danger that causes or reveals feelings. (Sex pollen would be an excellent reason for hurt/comfort.) Speaking of feelings, I’m into the ideas where everyone assume Hiraga and Roberto are in a relationship and Hiraga is completely oblivious.

Luke Snyder

I'm a super cliche shipper of Luke/Reid. I love the pairing and I still resent the way the show ended. That being said,&nbsp; I would love a 'Train? What train?' story, or something during their (admittedly bumpy) courtship. I would also be happy with a more gen Luke-centered story. I would prefer that Luke's alcoholism not be a main focus of the story unless you have a good grasp of addiction &amp; recovery. But if you DO have those things, then incorporating Luke's recovery would be cool. I also like his relationships with his younger siblings.

Call the Midwife 

The thing I love most about this show are the relationships and the way that Nonnatus House is a source of help &amp; hope in Poplar. If you're moved to do a well researched historical look at a social issue (as the series often does), that would be cool. But honestly, I'd be just as pleased with a cheerful slice-of-life. I would be happy with a gen story, but if you choose to include a relationship, I enjoy the canon relationships of Chummy/Peter,&nbsp; Tom/Barbara, Shelagh/Patrick and Patsy/Delia. I don't especially care for Tom/Trixie (I simply didn't think they were well suited), so if your story is set during their romance, I would prefer it not be the main focus. I know that there is a lot of angst &amp; drama in the source material, but I prefer that this story be at least hopeful.

Machineries of Empire Series - Yoon Ha Lee 
Vahenz afrir dai Noum, Liozh Zai

So, this is a great fandom if you're into terrifying competent people, and Vahenz is up there on the list. Her reports are a constant source of glee: so chatty, so scattered with (possibly totally fake!) personal details -- and so full of references to her interactions with Zai. Nothing I fall for quite like a pairing of a ruthless idealist and an equally ruthless schemer. I love the idea of Vahenz seducing Zai (politically and otherwise) and somewhere along the way catching feelings, but knowing all along that if anything goes wrong she'll have to kill Zai to minimize damage and wondering whether Zai knows it, too. I also, for as little pagetime comparatively as she gets, find Zai endlessly fascinating: the deadly serious Liozh roleplaying! The actual devotion to democracy! I really want to know more about what's up with her world view, her approach to politics, etc. 

Assorted prompts: First meeting, Vahenz's first attempts to incite Zai to heresy? Vahenz giving Zai pointers on public relations? The two of them arguing about the new calendar? I can see Zai sticking at how limited their changes are, such as not being able to get rid of remembrances. How about the moment Zai decided she'd had enough? 

Generally I'm up for any Fortress of Scattered Needles interpersonal drama. If you're looking for side characters to include, I'm particularly interested in Nirai Faian and her and Iruja's experiments.

The Divine Cities Series - Robert Jackson Bennett 
Shara Komayd, Turyin Mulaghesh

So, right, funny story about me and these books: very early on in City of Stairs I made a mistake. The moment Shara met Mulaghesh, my genre senses (and/or my id?) said, Ah, the Local Authority that the Dashing Spy is working with/against, I know my spy genre, clearly here we have the Love Interest! Excellent! I was... wrong! It took me longer than I'm comfortable admitting to work out that I was wrong, and by then is was way too late for me not to ship it fervently. That exchange in Blades about Mulaghesh succeeding by being extremely obnoxious was very good for me. 

So... what I'd like is version where I'm not wrong: all the weird manipulative romance between prickly, competent women working together. Whether you go AU during Stairs, write something set between Stairs and Blades, or something set after Blades, I'll be happy. Some other favorite characters, if it helps, are Signe, Ivanya, and Olvos.

The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi 

This canon is one of the most gloriously id-satisfying things I've ever read: space opera, heists, intertextuality with the Arsène Lupin stories, a main character being dragged kicking and screaming into redemption. I finished rereading the books just before nominations closed and scrambled to pick the four best characters to facilitate an "any" request. What I'm after is post-canon fic: in particular, everything about Sirr's future. How do its politics shake out in this new setting? The Sobornost are obviously no longer an issue, but internal politics are still there, and there will be new opportunities for the jinn, with access to zoku tech. Use whatever combination of characters calls out to you! I have specific prompts for them in my letter. 

DNW: permanent memory loss*; plotless fluff; mundane/setting change AUs

*this is a consistent DNW but it occurs to me it's a little fraught for this fandom. What I'm against here is a story that ends in "and then they forgot everything that happened!" so. As long as you avoid that, it's all good.

Completely Optional Prompts: 

As far as I'm concerned, there can never be enough stories exploring the wider world of the Blade movies, particularly the Nightstalker network. How does Whistler senior go about setting it up, and how does Abby get involved?  How does Abigail and King's cell fit in with the wider Nightstalkers' network? Are they the main cell? R&amp;D? The misfits?

In one of the codas at the end of the movie, seen in the extended version, the vampires have been wiped out by DayStar and Abby and King are now hunting werewolves with Caulder, with the suggestion that the werewolves they're hunting have somehow been vampirised.  Tell me about that, whether it's how they move into werewolf hunting, or about one hunt in particular.

What happens when a hunt goes wrong? What if Abby's hurt? Or King?

Do they ever have to go undercover to find their mark? Troll night clubs looking for vampire lairs? Haunt metro networks or street corners?

Do they ever take the night off? What does downtime look like to a vampire hunter?

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story).

Completely Optional Prompts: 

It looks like we won't be getting any more Emerald City (sad face) so I'm all about fic that picks up where the series left off. 

What happens when Lucas comes for Dorothy? Does she go back to Oz with him? Does she not?  Do they face the Beast Forever and defeat it, save her mother?

What about Lucas's relationship with Glinda? Is he still torn between being Roan and being Lucas?  Why did Jane send him, or did she? Is it a trap?

Or, how did Lucas make the decisions he did that led to him trying to kill Dorothy? Was it simply the power that Glinda exerts, or something deeper that that? Something of Roan?

What about Dorothy? Was it grief or rage or something else that had her literally putting Lucas back where she found him?

How do they move past it? Do they? Or does it get buried under the weight of things they have to go, a silent tension between them while they do what needs to be done?

What about Toto? Does he make go back to Oz, too?

Other things you might want to know: I have read all of the Oz books, but that was many, many moons ago when I was wee.

I love how Button tries so hard to live up to their expectations of him, how he's itching to do more, but how he's still a child in many ways - trusting and impatient both at once. I love Charley's big brother like exasperation, and Boss's barely hidden affection, as rough and ready as the man himself. And how eager Button is for that praise, the need for validation.

Just anything about this little family - before the movie or after it - would be great.

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> The only reason I haven't also selected Sue is because I don't want to limit you to a post-movie fic. But if you want to include her, I'd be really happy with that. And if you do want to set it pre-movie, feel free to include Mose. 

No slash or underage sex for this fandom, please. Thank you.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves. No non-con, whether that's actual, implied or somehow averted (references to canon are fine, but shouldn't be the focus of the story). No death fic, although I'm okay with a story dealing with the aftermath if it happened in canon.

Sólo quiero caminar | Just Walking (2008) 
Aurora Rodriguez, Gabriel (Sólo quiero caminar)

Please see my letter for information on why I love this fandom in particular, and wider info on my likes and dislikes.  I ship my chosen characters, but it's okay if you don't :)

Completely Optional Prompts: 

Can I just say one thing - why the hell does no one in this movie ever think to call a bloody ambulance? I mean, I get the aesthetic, but frankly if you've got time for a dramatically slow death scene, full of conversations with loved ones, then you've got time to call an ambulance.

So let's call one, yeah?  

So what I want is fix-it fic. No one dies. They escape. They carry out more crimes. They're avenging angels for the abused women and children of the world. Gloria sees her kid grow up and Paloma isn't forced into that weird thing of raising a teenager who's got a crush on each other.  Gabriel and Aurora actually learn about each other. Maybe they're all on the run from the mob. Maybe they aren't. Where do they go from here?

That's really what I want, but feel free to elaborate however you like on that bare-bones request :D

<b>Other things you might want to know:</b> I'm perfectly happy if you want to include the whole gang. I'm just thoroughly intrigued by Aurora and Gabriel (and those smoking hot scenes) between them, so I'd like any story to focus on them, please.

Loves: found families, competent women, loyalty kink, trust, partners.
DNWs: I have a massive second hand embarrassment squick, so please, no humiliating characters or having them embarrass themselves.

Blue Plate Special - Jeff Lee Johnson 

For this prompt: I'm pretty open to anything.  You don't have to stick to the nominated characters, you can crossover, you can do meta worldbuilding.  Pic something in the picture and tell me a story about it.  

This will be an exception to some of my general notes below in that tentacle sex is always a good thing if that's what you're about too.  Just throwing that into the mix.  You're not obligated and I'm not expecting it, just saying that if the many tentacles strike your tentacle sex fancy than that's okay.

General Notes:

After a particularly difficult year where I defaulted due to stressing out over the requests of my assignment I have adopted the philosophy that Yuletide needs to be for the writer as much as the reader.  So, I firmly believe that you should write what makes you happy.  Doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to read it, but I want you to write something you'll be happy with and that won't cause you too much stress during the next few months.  

With that in mind please do take note of the following things:

I'm not looking for smut or sex or anything above a R rating (and R is probably pushing things).  My kinks are highly specific and I'm not interested in you writing for them.  I'm just not.  If the only way you'll be happy this Yuletide is to write 1000 words of smut, then you do you.  Just understand that I most likely won't read it, but I'm giving you permission to do that.

I enjoy most every fandom trope out there, but the ones that mess with consent (AMTDI, Sex Pollen, etc).  Certain ones I'm not overly fond of (A/B/O, wing!fic, people-as-pets, things along these lines) but will enjoy an interesting deconstruction of the trope or twist on it.

Beyond that write what makes you happy.  And feel free to have the mods contact me about anything you have questions on.

Maybe they're just hanging out at the Last Dance drinking milkshakes.

If you read the Incryptid Series as well feel free to explore their relationship with each other in relation to their connections to the Price family.  I think it's interesting that they're both Price family ghosts, but they didn't interact for like 40 years.  How'd that work?

Pyre (Video Game) 
Jodariel (Pyre), The Reader (Pyre), Pamitha Theyn, The Moon-Touched Girl (Pyre)

I’d love a story that takes these characters and explores the world through them - especially the Rites. How does it feel to be in a Rite? What relationship do they have to the Reader? Or you could write about the revolution, and the Commonwealth, and how these people change the world &lt;3 Feel free to pick any mix of liberated people - whatever suits the story. I don’t have one particular solid headcanon for this game; part of what I like about it is that it feels like there are good things and bad things for any given ending for any given character.

Jodariel is the best, and I ship her like crazy with everyone. Her design is super appealing to me for one thing, with her buff arms and her horns and the way she moves in the Rites, both hulking and graceful. I love her mixture of kindness and reserve and frosty defensiveness - you can see how her history has shaped her, made her afraid and defensive, but also how incredibly kind she is. I’m up for any kind of story about her life in the Downside, but especially stories that focus on her place in the Nightwings, and how she feels about the other characters (I started to write out notes about individual relationships, realised how long it would be, and gave up. But I love all of them). Or how her life changes if she’s Liberated.

Pamitha is incredible. She’s beautiful, she’s snarky, she can fly. What’s not to love??? I really love her story with her sister, and how she begs you to lose the liberation rite against the Essence. A story about her and Tabitha would be incredible - whether they’re both liberated, only one of them is, or they both stay Downside.

The Moon-Touched Girl is great. I really like the way in which she’s odd - her perspective on reality might not be the same as other people, but it has its own internal logic. And she can be very sharp and intuitive. Her backstory hints at sadness, but it’s not the point of her character - her story is as much about her present and future as the experiences that led her to the Nightwings. I love her interactions with basically everyone - a fic about how she sees the other characters would be fantastic. Or a story about her experiences after the end of the game, especially if she is chosen in the Liberation Rite. (I called her Mae, as a nod to Night in the Woods, but give her whatever name you like for her.)

Given how much choice you have about the Reader, there’s a lot of different options. The only thing that I ask is that you make the Reader female - since I prefer my reader ships f/f. Otherwise, you can use whatever backstory you prefer. I chose the crippled scholar, and I do like the implications of the Reader being physically disadvantaged - the way that plays into their role in the Rites. But use whatever suits your feelings and story. As for story prompts: honestly, I think I’m mostly interested in fic about the Reader’s in story feelings. How do they feel about the role they were thrust into? How do they make their decisions about who to choose for Liberation? Or post-game fic about the consequences of their choices would also be fascinating.

&nbsp;

Ship-wise, I adore Jodariel/Pamitha, as a fabulous enemies-to-lovers ship (and this is one that I would be totally up for porn with - between Jodariel’s horns and Pamitha’s wings there is some really good potential, plus I could see them having a lot of fun with bondage - though who’s tying up who is a serious question). I’d love stories that tackle how they might get together, whether it’s slow burn, or a physical relationship that awkwardly dredges up feelings. (If you’re writing slow burn, don’t feel obliged to include the whole relationship. A short fic that was entirely stumbling blushes and awkward touches and the promise of something more down the line would be incredible.)

I also really like Jodariel/Moon-Touched Girl. It’s protrayed more as a familial relationship in canon, but I could easily see it becoming romantic. Though I imagine the Moon-Touched Girl would have to initiate things (and in fic with age differences, I do usually prefer the younger person to take the lead).

Jodariel/Reader is also great - partly because I am weak and Jodariel is hot, and partially because I think she’s the one of the companions who takes the most work. Getting her to open up and trust you is tricky, and I always like a puzzle that’s hard to solve. I particularly enjoy this ship as one where Jodariel is much taller and stronger than the Reader, because I am shallow.

Since I’m requesting the Reader, I’ll mention that I also really like Reader/Sandra. Obviously, Sandra wasn’t nominated, so this is very, very optional, but I did find their relationship fascinating. The tensions that exist in a situation where the Reader has all the power, Sandra’s loneliness and sarcasm and longing for companionship, the complications of not being able to touch - it is all such good stuff.

響け! ユーフォニアム | Hibike! Euphonium (Anime) 
Kousaka Reina, Oumae Kumiko

I got an absolutely wonderful gift for this fandom two years ago, but that was before season two came out, and I am weak and I want more. As much as I loved season two’s focus on family and sisterly relationships, I was a bit gutted that we didn’t get more of Reina and Kumiko. (That said, I really liked that Taki-sensei firmly rejected Reina. It was one of his best moments as a teacher, and I was so happy to see that subplot over and done with.)

I love both Reina and Kumiko separately, for different reasons. I love Reina for her overwhelming drive to succeed, and her passion, and how proud she is of her own talent. And I love Kumiko for her bluntness, and nosiness, and how she pays attention to people. And I love that she loves music, even though it takes her a bit longer to realise it. Fics that are about music - about how either or both of them relate to music, and about how it shapes and guides them through their lives would be amazing. I like to think that music is important to them for the rest of their lives.

If you’re writing shippy fic (and I ship the heck out of these two), I’d love a fic about them in college, or even later in their life. I like to imagine them both as professional musicians, eventually, and it would be really interesting to read a fic about how that plays into a romantic relationship between them. Something about them figuring out their feelings would be great - especially if there’s mutual pining. Or something about them in an established relationship, and how they juggle work and time commitments and all those other things. Reina is a genius, and while Kumiko has talent, she’s not quite at the same level, so that seems like something they might have to work around.

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price, Mary Crawford

I’m happy with both the Fanny/Edmund and Fanny/Henry, and if you want to include either in your story, I’ll enjoy them, but I have to confess that I would kill for a Fanny/Mary story that does what so many Fanny/Henry stories do, and breaks away from canon to write a different ending. I’m always a sucker for femslash, and the dynamic between Fanny and Mary is one that fascinates me. It has a lot of the same appeal as Fanny/Henry - that in falling for one of the Crawfords, Fanny truly changes her perspective on someone, and it pushes her away from the traditional Bertrams towards a more modern group of people. I also think it creates interesting tensions in Mary and Henry's relationship, and Fanny and Edmund's. On top of that, I actually really enjoy stories that are about starting relationships against the pressures of society and working out a way to be happy while dealing with repression. As long as they have happy endings. And I would ask, if you write this, that you give them a happy ending. I don't need them to be universally accepted by everyone around them, out and proud, but I would like them to be happy with each other.

* One thing that would be very interesting is to see Mary and Fanny in a completely different setting: perhaps in Mary’s London circle. I don’t think Fanny would be at all comfortable, that’s what would be so interesting.

Fanny is a great character. She’s extremely insecure, but in an incredibly relatable way, and despite her insecurity she has a will of absolute iron. She’s got a lot of insight into people, but she can also be very blind, especially as it concerns herself. And all of this is bound up in her morality. Fanny is an extremely ethical person, though her standards of ethics and morality don’t totally align with a modern perspective. I think her consistent desire to do what is right, rather than what is easy, is part of what makes her such a great character, but she doesn’t always consider other people’s perspectives, and it would be cool to see a fic that challenge some of her presumptions of the world.
* I’d love a fic where Fanny is, for whatever reason, trapped in a room making conversation with someone she would normally never talk to. Again, that idea of pushing at her boundaries a little, and exploring what her limits are, but also maybe giving her a chance to reconsider an assumption, really appeals to me. The person she’s talking to could be someone like the Admiral, Mary and Henry’s uncle, or one of Mary’s friends, or even one of the Admiral’s mistresses.
Fanny’s refusal of Mr. Crawford is one of my favourite parts of the book, even though I like fic where they do get married. That enduring and tenacious refusal is such a powerful plot point. I’d love to see fic about other times in her life when she had to draw on that stubbornness. (If you wanted to make this a ‘five times’ fic you totally could - I’m always a fan of those, but just one time would be equally interesting.)

Mary fascinates me because of the many ways in which she serves as a foil to Fanny. They’re great mirror images of each other. She’s superficially much more decisive and strong-willed than Fanny, but underneath she’s actually much more reliant on what other people think of her. In an odd way, she’s also very insecure. She really needs to be liked by other people, I think, really wants the approval of those around her. Whereas Fanny, though she feels that she doesn’t really deserve love and affection, is very good at relying on her own inner resources.
* A fic about Mary’s past, and her childhood, would be delightful. It’s only touched on very briefly in the story, but she must have had an extremely challenging childhood, between the deaths of her parents and being raised in a house with an aunt she loved and an uncle she hated. There’s a line in the book where Fanny says that Mary shouldn’t speak ill of her uncle, even though he’s not a good person, and while it’s completely true by the mores of Jane Austen’s time, I kind of love Mary for refusing to bow to those standards and pretend that her uncle is a good person when he pretty clearly isn’t.
* There’s a comparison that’s often made between Austen and Mary Crawford - that although Mary is the antagonist, she’s a lot more similar to Austen than Fanny is. I don’t entirely know how fair that is, but it did give me the idea of Mary becoming a writer like her creator, and I think that could make for a great fic. Maybe, years later, she writes about a fictionalised version of the events of Mansfield Park? It would be really interesting to see how she might revisit that story in later years, and what, if anything, she would change.

Little Witch Academia 
Atsuko "Akko" Kagari, Diana Cavendish

It actually took me a while to sit down and watch this anime, but I loved it to pieces when I did. It’s so creative and fun and exciting, and the characters are just so likeable.

Akko is great. One thing I really like about her is that although she can be kind of lazy and flaky and impatient, we actually see her putting in the work. She really fights for her skills, and I love every moment when her earnestness and hard-work and determination shine through. She’s so sincere and sweet. I’d love a story about her learning magic, and improving. The magic in the series is so fun and creative, and I really like the world, so just Akko studying could make for a brilliant fic.

Diana is interesting - I like her in the series a lot more than in the original OVA. I love her kindness, and her determination to do the right thing, and the walls she puts up to hide her generosity and compassion. She’s genuinely a really good person, underneath the arrogance and standoffishness. I’d be particularly interested in stories about her relationship to her family, and how she feels about her heritage. Or stories about her in the ‘normal’ world, where she can’t use her magic and has to rely on her other skills.

And of course, I adore Diana/Akko as a ship. Getting together fic would be great, or fic about them working out exactly what it is they feel for each other. The series has a lot of tropey fun with things like the love bee, and I would love a fic where maybe some magical mishaps forces them to confront feelings they might not otherwise acknowledge. I think Akko and Diana are two people who are really good for each other, and they push and challenge each other in ways that make them both better people - which I guess is the ideal.

British Government Cats RPF 
Palmerston (British Government Cats RPF)

I admit it: in the Larry vs. Palmerston feud, I am a Palmerston partisan. That doesn't mean I'm not interested in the other cats, but I'd like him to be the star of the show. Does Palmerston ever get his medal (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/768462331508625408)? Meet his tigers (https://twitter.com/DiploMog/status/808723549309517825)? Why does Treasury keep Gladstone,
as the Telegraph once put it, "under lock and key," and can Palmerston befriend his colleague anyway? What was Freya straying in search of, and can Palmerston piece together the clues left in her absence? And what's the root of his feud with Larry, anyway?

In general, I am more interested in a story from the perspective of the cats than one from a human perspective. I would prefer no cat death (though brief references to off-screen death of OCs are fine if, e.g., you want to write some sort of mystery, as are mentions of predecessors dying from old age or similar).

If inspiration strikes you, I would love a fusion or crossover with another Yuletide-sized fandom here. Diane Duane's Cats of Grand Central series comes to mind as one obvious choice; seeing Palmerston somehow embroiled in Falcon business in a Rivers of London crossover could also be cool.

I'm also happy with something cracky. An AU where Sir Simon McDonald turns into a cat and has to be taught feline ways by Palmerston? Yes please. (I'd prefer no AUs where cats turn into humans, though.) Palmerston is appointed Ambassador to [Country] and everyone treats this as perfectly normal? Sign me up. Post-apocalyptic cat road trip? I'm on board.

Slip Slidin' Away - Paul Simon (Song) 
The Woman Who Became A Wife, The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown, The Father Who Had A Son, Delores (Slip Slidin' Away)

I am fond of songfic that takes lyrical metaphors excessively literally. Why is The Man Who Wears His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown in danger of disappearing? What's The Woman Who Became A Wife's objection to rain? What's making the road they travel so difficult to glide down? How is God involved in the whole mess? But if you'd rather be more subtle and illusive, that's cool too. 

Fantasy, science fictional, and dystopic settings are my jam. Maybe they're all time-travelers, working together to wander the twisty roads of alternate timelines and try to fix their society's their future, but always finding the result not quite as planned? (Maybe Delores lives in the past, and The Man Who Wore His Passion For His Woman Like A Thorny Crown's love jeopardizes their mission.) Maybe they've successfully defeated the Evil Overlord and are finding that bringing their kingdom back to peacetime (and finding their own happiness within it) is more complicated than anticipated. Maybe they're space travelers voyaging between unstable wormholes. 

If you're not into speculative fiction, I'm also a fan of historical/period pieces. Pick a time and place that speaks to you, and show me how these people struggle to balance their hopes and regrets. Whatever route you go, I don't expect all the characters to have equal prominence, but I would like to see the different verses connected into a single story somehow.

Tuya is Maika's best friend; she's also Maika's betrayer, and as of Volume 2 we have no idea why. I'm interested in speculation about what's going on in her head and what she's experienced since splitting up from Maika (complicated Dusk Court politics would definitely be my jam), but I'm equally intrigued by their backstory in the camps and with the Scyth. I ship the two of them, but that doesn't mean I expect them to find a happy ending--happy-for-now shippy backstory with foreshadowing to what lies ahead would be great, and I'd also be interested in something unrequited (from either side). 

If you want to include other characters, Kippa is one of my favorites, and I'm curious what she and Tuya would have to say to one another if they ever met. I'm also fascinated by Maika's relationship with her mother; what's Tuya's take on it? What was Tuya's own relationship with her parents?

Cannibalism, murder, torture, vivisection, and general mayhem on level with canon are fine, but please no rape.

Stranger Things (TV 2016) 
Nancy Wheeler, Barbara "Barb" Holland

This is a desperate plea for fix-it fic: I like everything about this show except for the disparity between how Barb and Will's disappearances were handled. Will's disappearance gets to be the focus of the show; Barb's, well, no one except Nancy seems to care that she's gone at all. But I care. So: show me Nancy interacting with other people who care that Barb is gone. Or give me Nancy and Barb backstory that develops Barb's character and their friendship. Or, if you're up for it, give me an AU where Barb is rescued, instead of or in addition to Will. How does her time in the Upside Down change her? How does Nancy help her re-integrate on her return? What do their lives look like, ten or twenty years later? Or what about an AU where she's never taken--maybe one where Hawkins National Laboratory rescues her, and she ends up working for/with them?

I am happy to read Nancy and Barb as platonic friends or (if they both live) as a femslash pairing. I do find the canonical pairings interesting, but they're teenagers and prone to being fickle in love; if you want to break Nancy and Steve up, that's fine with me. I also enjoy poly fic in this fandom.

Third Crusade RPF 
Richard I of England (Third Crusade), Philip II of France (Third Crusade)

Yes, yes, yes, I know, maybe it was just a political thing, Richard and Philip sleeping in the same bed. I don’t care. I want it not to be. I want all the stories where Richard and Philip fell as powerfully in lust and/or in love as Eleanor and Henry before them. Richard was widely known as being extremely attractive – 6’5”, powerful, reddish-gold hair, dynamic and decisive. I know less about Philip’s canonical looks, but I do love <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/whtq0xaun/amiel_portrait.jpg">this 19th century portrait of him</a>, whether or not it’s accurate. 

Any of my general likes that fit this situation would be excellent here! (See my letter for general likes/prompts.) How does their relationship begin? When does Richard go from ‘enemy of my dad is my friend, let’s go talk to Phil and see if he’ll help’ to ‘shit, Phil grew UP’? Did Philip initially only intend to make his friendship with Richard tighter, and then once they’re in bed together for the grand Photo-Op of Friendship for the benefit of the court (and to disturb Richard’s father), realise that he’s got himself into bed with a tall drink of water? Do they joke about the complicated political situation in between stealing kisses in the garden? Is Richard the first guy Philip’s been with? Does either give the other symbolic jewelry/other presents? Does Richard joke about wanting to marry Philip instead of Philip’s half-sister Alys? 

Anything set during the period from 1187-1189, while Richard &amp; Philip were allied against Henry, would be amazing. I feel like this would be the happiest time for them, before Henry died and Richard became king, putting his relationship with Philip on an uneasier footing (given the power dynamics at play between France and England) and eventually leading to open conflict. All the happy falling-in-love, scheming-against-one’s-father, two ruthless young men falling in lust and love, as you can manage. :D

But this isn’t the only possible time period, of course! After Richard became King, he went on the Third Crusade with Philip and others, determined to rescue Jerusalem from Saladin. This could also be a very fruitful setting for fic. I think it’s really interesting that one of the reasons both Richard and Philip went on Crusade at the same time was that they were afraid that if one of them stayed behind he’d take advantage of the other’s absence to go after his land! It’s hard to be friends/lovers when you’re rival monarchs. :( If you’re writing shipfic during this time, I’d prefer a bittersweet tone that remembered good times of the past over a darker angst one, though there’s certainly angst to be had aplenty as Richard and Philip’s relationship unravels over the course of the Crusade. 

Feel free to use as much or as little of the politics of the Third Crusade as you like. I love history, and I love historical detail, so if you’re a gen writer and you want to write complicated-friendship fic about how Richard and Philip quarrelled over Cyprus, go for it. On the other hand, if you want to write a mostly-history-free story about Richard and Philip’s last night together before Philip leaves the Crusade and goes back to France, I’d love that too! 

I would also love a fic set in an AU where men marrying each other is totally normal (though rare among royalty because of the need for heirs), and Richard and Philip fall in love and decide to get married and combine their kingdoms (much to Henry and Eleanor’s probable dismay). It would work out heir-wise because Philip’s son Louis was born in 1187 and his wife Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, so he’d have been a widower free to marry for love at that point. (Or you could delete Philip’s marriage entirely, though in that case I’m not sure what they would have done for an heir. Mpreg? Adoption being a legitimate way to acquire royal heirs?) I would be equally pleased with this scenario being taken seriously or being treated more tongue-in-cheek (with comical reactions from Henry, Eleanor, John, etc.)

Wars of the Roses RPF 
Margaret Beaufort (Wars of the Roses), Margaret of Anjou (Wars of the Roses)

I really love these characters. Both of them had a huge number of trials in their lives, and they fought on anyway. (For more on my thoughts about them, see my letter - I have no room here.)

A general prompt for both of them: In the middle of all their political moves, they unexpectedly fall in love with one of their friends/ladies-in-waiting/enemies. They realise they’ve never actually been in love before (not surprising, given the political nature of their marriages), and this new development is both thrilling and scary. (I love snatched moments of happiness, even while the world is burning around you. I have no problem with infidelity if it's a f/f relationship that's ‘cheating’ on arranged/coerced marriages.)

For this fandom, feel free to treat it as "or" matching rather than "and". Although if you want to put both Margarets in the same fic, I'd be up for that too!


  <b>Margaret of Anjou</b>


Apart from Margaret-bashing stories and heartbreaking deathfic (aka when Edward dies at Tewkesbury), I’m open to pretty much anything. Some ideas:

•	When did Margaret first realise the scope of the task that loomed before her – protecting Edward’s inheritance until he was old enough to protect it himself? Did she quail at first? How did she learn to be ruthless?
•	Margaret and Edward’s relationship over the years, as she reared him to be the King his father had never been able to be. Did she worry that his father’s instability would be passed down to him? How did she feel when he started reaching maturity? When he married Anne Neville?
•	Margaret during Edward IV’s first reign, when she and her son Edward had fled to France and were making allies and building support. What were her first meetings with Warwick like?
•	It’s said that Elizabeth Woodville may have been one of Margaret of Anjou’s ladies at one point. If that was so, what might Margaret have thought of Elizabeth and where she ended up?
&nbsp;
  <b>Margaret Beaufort</b>

I want to read so many stories about Margaret! Seriously, if you have an idea already, I’m probably going to be all ears. (The only exception is that I’m not into a romantic Margaret/Edmund story, since she was twelve and had no choice in the matter.)

Some ideas:
•	Margaret’s negotiations with Elizabeth Woodville - what were those two powerhouses like together?
•	Margaret persuading/manipulating/forcing her husband Lord Stanley to betray Richard III, even though Stanley was risking the life of his own son in doing so
•	Margaret’s relationship with her son Henry over the years
•	Margaret was one of Anne Neville’s close friends and ladies-in-waiting – and yet was all the time planning to betray Anne’s husband Richard III (and thus Anne). Was this difficult at all for her?
•	Margaret’s relationship with Elizabeth of York
•	Margaret saying “done with men” and swearing an oath of chastity in front of everybody and moving out on her own while still married to Stanley. How amazing must it have been to live alone without a husband for the first time she could remember? How satisfying was it to be allowed to own her own property at last?
•	I’m all for women like Margaret being able to take joy in successfully completing their life’s work. What was Margaret feeling the day her son was crowned King of England?
•	How did Margaret change over the years, from the child mother to the Queen Mother Triumphant?

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
James I of Great Britain (Stuart Dynasty RPF), George Villiers 1st Duke of Buckingham (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Yes, this is the “<a href="https://deafeningtimetravelgalaxy.tumblr.com/post/165928527919/nudityandnerdery-bemusedlybespectacled">Local King Cannot Stop Promoting His Boyfriend</a>” ship. :D

Basically for this fandom I’d love to read all the happy fun fic about a king and his handsome boyfriend (Buckingham was literally called “the handsomest-bodied man in all England” by a contemporary – not James I, though he presumably thought so too), who didn’t care what anybody thought about them, were totally in love, and even built a passage linking their bedrooms together. (The better to avoid any pesky dudes-in-waiting!)

For this a lot of my general prompts would work really well (see my letter for general prompts/likes), but a few specific ones:

•	Anything about the ‘constant promotions’ thing, whether serious (James is so in love, he can’t resist giving Buckingham more and more power and influence, damn the jealousy of other nobles!) or funny (‘you’re giving me another title, James? Why not just another blowjob?’)
•	AU in which marrying a guy is fine, it’s just the fact that Buckingham is the son of a minor gentleman and not a foreign prince that causes James headaches with the rest of the nobility. (But he doesn’t care, he’s still going to marry him.)
•	I’m also a big fan of historical marriages during periods where homosexuality was illegal. Just because it wasn’t public and ‘blessed by God’ doesn’t mean that James and Buckingham pledging themselves to each other wouldn’t have meant something to them. So anything in which they have a personal/private marriage would be great.
•	A fic about the way they met! (Apparently Buckingham ‘caught James’s eye’ at a hunt when he was twenty-one.) How did he catch James’s eye? Just by being drop-dead gorgeous? Was he funny/witty as well? Did he flirt with the king?
•	Given that Buckingham stayed in power after James died, because he was friends with James’s son Charles I, how did that relationship go during James’s lifetime? Did Charles know that James and Buckingham were lovers? (Did he care?) Obviously if he did know he didn’t freak out, since he didn’t denounce Buckingham or even have him removed from power once James died. (In fact Buckingham was the only man of James’s court to keep his position under Charles.)
•	Buckingham loved to sit for portraits. Fic of James being impatient at this and flirting with him/trying to persuade him to skive off his sitting early would be great. 
•	Anything with flirting in public in a homophobic society is my jam. Did they maintain plausible deniability? Were they pretty shameless, daring the nobles to do anything about it because James was King, soooo…
•	I absolutely love James’s declaration to the Privy Council: “You may be sure that I love the Earl of Buckingham more than anyone else, and more than you who are here assembled. I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had John, and I have George.” Anything about this/set on this day/what Buckingham said when he heard about it/etc. would be great!
•	Any of your own happy/funny plotbunnies about James/Buckingham!

I'd be thrilled with a story that touches on the lives of any of the nominated characters - Miriam, Ysabeau, Marcus, or Sarah - anything at all in the story's particular world of witches, daemons, and vampires, as well as the genetic lore in the Book of Life or the historical lore behind millennia of creatures. With the new TV series in production, interest is likely to rise. If you want to explore someone's personal history (centuries of options for many characters) or dive into what they were doing while Matthew and Diana timewalked to the Elizabethan era, I'd be thrilled.

I'm really open to anything for these characters, with the exception of love triangles. I don't mind if you write Nancy/Steve or Jonathan/Nancy or whatever, but I hate love triangles.

Not into it, not here for it. That being said, their friendship is one of my most favorite things, especially their shared pasts, and that would be fun to see explored. Full disclosure, Brandt is my favorite, so if you do any kind of MI story I'd really appreciate or request you'd make him the main focus. ;) I came away from Rogue Nation specifically in love with Ilsa Faust and her story, and have kind of totally partnered her up with Brandt in my head romantically, though I'd be into seeing how her dynamics work with Ethan or anyone else on the team. And Jane, well, I've loved Jane since GP and there's NEVER enough about her. I guess what I'm saying is ALL THE TEAM FIC OR BACKGROUND FIC OR EVEN JUST A FOCUS ON ONE CHARACTER WOULD BE GREAT?

I mean look if you wanna make this queer i am Obviously HERE FOR IT, and please feel free to push that rating as far up as you can make it go. But you def dont have to! They can screw the Farmer Boy on the tractor too (together? Independently? Sequentially?)! 

I kid, I kid. I just want free form free wheeling adventure feelings, riding down the highway playing hooky with your best friend, knowing you're the shit and you can bend this world to your will, because you are young and beautiful (and in love?) and you live in a world where strip clubs have amateur night (???) and you look amazing in a suit. Capture the feeling of the wind in your hair. Tell me about that car and where they got it. What happened when they got back to school? What happened to the tractor? Maybe its ten years later and life has twisted and turned but theyre still friends. Maybe theyre not, and they meet in a supermarket (at a strip club?) and suddenly the world seems fresher and they remember that night. Maybe someone's pregnant! Go crazy! Write me the novel of how their paths led to this moment. Write me porn. It always seems you got something on your mind other than me!
But maybe lets leave actual steven tyler out of it, yes?

Royal Tenenbaums (2001) 
Eli Cash

Hello what I actually want is Eli Cash, Ritchie Tennenbaum and Margo Tennenbaum. Together? Sequentially? Yes. (see above prompt) (Lord I am ridiculous this year. All I want is threesomes and music videos, I am sorry) (In life, as it is in Yuletide).

Please tell me exactly what everyone is wearing, and what is playing on their old timey record player. Is Eli Cash ok? I bet he is. He strikes me as more resilient than the actual Tenenbaums. Does anyone who IS a Tenenbaum want to be one? What do they do in that huge old house, how do they find peace? Or, what happened w this crew BEFORE the events of the movie, how did they struggle and fall towards and away from each other? Is Eli on drugs? Does Ritchie ever play tennis again? HMM. All this distance between them and these ways they intersect with each other and have for years...do they ever find a way back to each other? What do they do about their FATHER (Royal I mean). Maybe Richie's mental illness rears its head again and the other two have to take care of him. Maybe Eli and the other two have a huge fight. Maybe Margo takes up writing again. Yeah!

"He's taken off his shoes, and one of his socks."

Request 1 by AngelQueen
Enola Holmes Series - Nancy Springer 
Enola Holmes, Sherlock Holmes (Enola Holmes)

I'd love to see how Enola might be involved in the events of The Final Problem. By the end of Enola's series, her brothers had come to accept her role as a detective in her own right, and one could assume that she and Sherlock might actually cooperate on a few cases. So when Sherlock's conflict with Moriarty rears its ugly head, how might Enola play into it? Would Moriarty threaten her, maybe send a few goons after her, to shake up Sherlock? Might Sherlock try to push her away to keep her at a safe distance so she doesn't get caught in the crossfire? I doubt Enola would care for that too much.

Would Sherlock confide in her about his survival at Reichenbach, or would he and Mycroft use her grief to sell Sherlock's demise to the wider world? One thing I'd love to see would be Enola racing across Europe to Reichenbach, intent on saving her brother, only to get up to the falls at the same time as Watson and the two of them having to deal with Sherlock's supposed demise?

Feel free to include other characters like Dr. Watson, Cecily Alistair, Mycroft Holmes, Mary Morstan, etc. if you need/want to.

Bonus points for Enola and Sherlock's eventual reunion and Enola giving him what-for for using her love for him in such a way.

DNWs: non-con, scat, d/s, A/B/O

Mary Russell - Laurie R. King 
Mary Russell, Sherlock Holmes (Mary Russell - King)

I'd love to see a fic delving into the off-hand comment at the end of The Marriage of Mary Russell where Russell ropes Billy into stealing a portrait of Holmes' mother out of the family chapel to give to Holmes. Perhaps a scene where they come back from their wedding trip and the portrait has already been delivered and hung in the cottage (perhaps in the sitting room)? Romantic goodness interspersed into this is always a plus (or as romantic as Russell and Holmes get, but then they would be newlyweds at this point - hint hint).

Feel free to include any other characters that you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

What if Richard had won at Bosworth? Would he have married Elizabeth? How do they handle all those who stood against them and participated in Henry Tudor's invasion? (I'd particularly love to see them deal with Margaret Beaufort.) 

Feel free to include as many other characters as you like.

DNWs: non-con, d/s, A/B/O

The White Princess (TV) 
Margaret Pole Countess of Salisbury (White Princess (TV))

A missing scene from the finale or a continuance of the confrontation between Margaret and Elizabeth over the executions of Richard and Teddy. Elizabeth and Henry seemed to have planned to let the two men live quietly in the Tower so as to not further the curse set upon the killers of Elizabeth's brothers, but Margaret's revealing the truth to the Spanish ambassador put paid to that plan, backing Elizabeth and Henry into a corner and forcing them to execute the two men. I'd love to see something where that knowledge is shoved into Margaret's face, proclaiming that she is just as responsible for the deaths of Richard and Teddy as Elizabeth and Henry are. I would just love to see something really highlighting how far Margaret's relationship with Elizabeth has fallen.

Feel free to include any other characters you like/need.

Request 1 by angelsunknown
Anastasia - Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally 
Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov Grand Duchess of Russia (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally)

I LOVE THIS MUSICAL SO MUCH! Like, don't get me wrong -- I'd be psyched to receive fic re: any of my nominated characters/fandoms, but. But. I LOVE THIS MUSICAL. 

I also love everyone in this bar, but I love Anya the *most*, which is why I've requested fic for her specifically. Feel free to include the other characters in your fic, though! (Also: I've seen the bootleg of the Hartford Stage production, but I'm also going to be seeing the show at the Broadhurst in December (!!!), so you could totally use either version to fuel/prop up your fic!)

(Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ What are Anya and Dmitry up to, post-musical?
+ Give me an AU where Anya takes Gleb up on his offer re: the tea shop, or where she misses Dmitry and Vlad at the Y. Palace. How does this change things for her?
+ Okay, so. I have a secret, long-shot wish for this fandom that you are totally not required to (even attempt to) fulfill, especially if you aren't into the idea, but here goes: You know how Anya wakes up (after the Ipatiev House massacre) 'by the side of a road' with these 'tracks all around' her?* WHAT IF -- WHAT IF! -- ONE OF THE OTHER GRAND DUCHESSES HAD (ALSO SURVIVED THE SHOOTING AND) LEFT HER THERE (knowing that they'd each have a better chance of making it out of Yekaterinburg alive alone)? I mean, historically-speaking, Tatiana and Maria *did* make friends with/sympathisers of some of their guards, and Olga *was* pretty shrewd ... I don't know. I'm generally not a fan of totally upending canon, but the Romanovs' story is such a sad one, and -- this canon being a mixture of fantasy and history -- you could totally make it a *bit* happier. (And, like, 2017 has been A Year. We need all the happy endings we can get, you know?) I would love, love, love to read about Anya reuniting with her ~mysterious savior~, or Anya(, Dmitry,) and the ~mysterious savior~ living happily ever after (in anonymity) together. (Note: if you choose to go down this route -- which, holy shit, means you're the bomb dot com! -- I'd appreciate it if you kept the no. of Romanov survivors at two? I wouldn't want this to get *too* far-fetched or out of hand, lmao.)

DNW: Anya attempting to reclaim her royal status/throne; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); non-con/rape; romanticising of the (Bolshevik) guards/murderers OR of Nicholas and Alexandra's reign; unrelenting angst -- I love angsty fic, but would prefer to receive something with a happy ending.

Assorted Notes: I definitely ship Anya/Dmitry; I'm always here for (unrealistic) rom-com tropes (...clearly); I'd love for your fic to be grounded in (the musical's) canon, but am also not opposed to its being bolstered by historical fact; the member of OTMA I find most interesting outside of Anastasia is probably Maria (*insert winking face emoji here*); and I am deeply, deeply sorry for all of the word vomit.

*In the HS production, I believe the last we see of the (other) Romanovs is the scene where their palace is seized by the Bolsheviks, which would make it pretty easy for you to make up your own 'this-is-how-Anya-and/or-MS-escaped' theories. I've heard the Broadway production is a little different, but ... just roll with the canon? Hand-wave away inconvenient details?

Cairo Time (2009) 
Juliette Grant, Tareq Khalifa

I watched this at the gym today -- and I really enjoyed it! It felt like a love letter to Cairo in all its dingy, dirty glory. 

I really like the characters, too -- both Juliette and Tareq felt *real* and wonderful. I know Yuletide requests operate under an 'AND' assumption, but I'd be more than OK with you only writing about Juliette OR Tareq.

Here are some (Totally Optional) PROMPTS:
+ Epistolary fic! In which Juliette and Tareq write each other emails (or letters; Tareq feels like more of a letter writer to me!), post-movie.
+ Fic in which Juliette revisits Cairo.
+ Fic in which Juliette sees more of the Middle East.
+ One of my favourite scenes in the movie is the one in which Juliette walks around the mosque, so, I don't know -- fic about Juliette and religion/spirituality?
+ Fic in which Tareq and Yasmeen meet up for coffee and conversation, post-movie.
+ Fic in which Tareq meets Kathryn, post-movie.
+ Fic in which you tell me about Tareq's life, post-movie.

DNW: anything (sexually) explicit; character bashing; fic written in the first person (unless it's in an epistolary format!); infidelity; wild AUs -- I love 'canon' AUs, but hate total re-hauls.


Request 3 by angelsunknown
The View RPF 

(Totally Optional) PROMPT:

Listen. You can totally do with this fandom/request what you will, but the reason I am requesting it -- and the reason I nominated it in the first place -- is that I think it would be ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS to write out a parody/satirised episode of the show in script-form, starring satirised versions of the hosts.

Like, I don't want to read about Actual Sunny Hostin, I want to read about Sunny the Super Prude. Give me Sara being totally bland and inoffensive on purpose, Jed. (RIP Jed.-era View!) only pretending to give a fuck re: conservative issues, Joy giving no fucks re: anything, Whoopi trying to make The View Whoopi's View every five minutes. (I didn't nominate Whoopi, because I ran out of slots, but feel free to include Whoopi --  and the Uber Christians (Paula and perpetually horny Candace) -- in this if you'd like!)

For what it's worth: my actual opinions/views on various matters tend to match Joy's and Sunny's; I disagree with Jed. (and Candace!!! She is The Actual Worst) on most things; and I am mostly 'meh' about Sara's and Whoopi's (and Paula's) contributions.

DNW: fic written in the first person; the hosts' RL children/husbands/partners/situations being brought into/up in the fic.

Richard II - Shakespeare 

I am always happy with Richard II fic of any kind. Absolutely anything about this play would ROCK, seriously. This is totally my standby "if you don't like the other prompts I will always be happy with this" prompt. There is actually a respectable (for a tiny little fandom) number of fics out there, but at this point, I actually wrote more than a few of them, and while they say "write the fic you want to read," it's nice when sometimes you don't have to. So I will be thrilled with anything you write! It can be slash or het or gen, any rating (I love smutty fics, so don't be afraid to write them, but don't sweat it if you don't like to write them), and I am willing to ship Richard with pretty much anyone who isn't his uncle or Northumberland (although Aumerle is my fave). He's like that. I am also very AU friendly (I kinda have a dream of an AU that sets the play on a Napoleonic sailing ship, but can't get around to doing the research myself, but honestly any AU setting is one I will probably dig) and I love stuff with historical backstory so if that floats your boat, feel free to write it!

Stuart Dynasty RPF 
Ben Jonson (Stuart Dynasty RPF), John Donne (Stuart Dynasty RPF)

Ben Jonson and John Donne are both poets (obviously!), both really difficult, and they were both Catholic for part of their lives. They also seem to have known each other, or at least had Strong Opinions about each other's poetry. Jonson comments on Donne's poetry a few times in his non-poetic works -- I know he does it in the Conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden and I think he also does it in Timber: or Discoveries (he makes fun of him for his irregular meters and says his Anniversaries are borderline blasphemous). Anyway! You can set it when they are young and generally confused, or when they are older and crankier, I do not care! And they can Have Adventures or alternately just drink beer and gripe, whatever you like. I would love to see a conversation between these two about poetry and religion and current events and possibly beer or whatever you'd like for them to talk about. There is no need to make it slashy, because I honestly cannot picture it (Donne I think is highly slashable if he's not, you know, Dean of St. Paul's at the time the fic is set, but Jonson is another matter), but if you can, I wouldn't, like, object to it or anything!

Rome (TV 2005) 
Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005)

I’d like anything about the requested characters, individually or together. For example, what were their lives like pre-series? They didn’t spring up fully formed at the battle of Alesia, right? What did the early years of the Vorenus/Niobe marriage look like? Where did Pullo spend his childhood? How did they join the legion?
What if Vorenus never found out about Niobe’s adultery, but Caesar still died. What Changes? What stays the same?
The lost adventures/camping trips we never got to see! Sightseeing! Intrigue! Rubbing elbows with the movers and shakers! Making love under the stars!
Post-series happy futurefic, farm optional. Because I ship them like burning, and Vorenus and Pullo alive and reunited is the only ending my id will accept.

Hornblower - C. S. Forester 
William Bush (Hornblower - Forester), Horatio Hornblower (Hornblower - Forester), Barbara Wellesley (Hornblower - Forester)

Bush POV please! He's my favorite character. I love his steadfastness, loyalty and stoicism. I love Hornblower's perfect balance between trainwreck and competence. I love how they work together well despite vastly different command styles - and that they wouldn't want it any other way. And then you throw Barbara into the mix...
Poor Horatio always seems to want what he doesn't have. When he's with Barbara, he's pining for "better than a wife" Bush, but as soon as he's at sea he starts missing the domestic life. Really, the solution is obvious: why not both? Long live the OT3!
I'd like something post-Flying Colours and pre-Lord Hornblower (or that goes AU from it). Sheerness is really not that far from the supposed Hornblower estate. And it only makes sense to invite Bush to celebrate his new captaincy (however desk-bound) in style! And Barbara, being the astute woman she is, would notice that while Horatio is cooling his heels waiting for his next command, and Bush is valiantly struggling not to hate his post, the one thing that cheers them up is each other's company... And then Horatio comes back from the Baltic terribly sick, owing his life to Bush, who has such a hard time relinquishing the nursing duties, and he and Barbara could bond over Horatio's sickbed...
And then they all work out an arrangement and raise Richard Arthur together and there's no Caudebec, right?

Jesper Fahey, Inej Ghafa, Kaz Brekker

I'm constantly surprised that there's not more fic for this series. It's such a fun, delightful story with great characters! And boy, oh boy, would I love a fic about these three. Like, I love Jesper/Wylan, loooove them, but I also really love the unrequited feelings Jesper had for Kaz, and I adore the friendship between Jesper and Inej, and Kaz/Inej is like one of the few het ships I have cared about recently? So basically I'd be really interested to see a story about them! Whether it's full triangle poly or, um, a V, or even if it's just gen, tbh. They're the originals, yk! I'm so curious about their backstory. Or if you want to have smth set in the future (just writing out Wylan, maybe, bc I really do love him and Jesper, and it'd make me sad to think of them breaking up, lol). Anyway, just reiterating, I love the idea of romantic feelings between the three of them (whether requited or not), but I would also really, really love gen about their friendships. More details in my letter! \o/ &lt;3

Whenever I rewatch this movie, I find myself wishing more fic for these two existed. I would in particular love a fic about the two of them falling in love after they move to New York City together. I know they would face difficulties and challenges because of the time period, but I would prefer that not to be the main focus of the fic. Please, no tragic endings or violence. I can handle angst/hurdles, but I'd prefer a happy or hopeful ending. I am generally just in love with them as characters and would be equally thrilled for great friendship fic as they spend their twenties trying to find the path that works for them (i.e., some level of deviation from the path prescribed for women of their generation).

Jupiter Ascending (2015) 
Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending), Caine Wise

This film hit so many notes on the scale of my id I cannot even. I rewatched it for letter-writing purposes and oh. my. god. I came out with a Lot of Jupiter/Caine feelings and also a Lot of feelings about Space Bureaucracy and also about praise!kink wolf fucking. I have no idea how to punctuate that latter, sorry dear writer. I'm also totally and enthusiastically on board with knotting for this pairing, but please no reference to wanting to breed someone or filling them with cum.

I would love a fic with lots of ridiculous space bureaucracy details, any exploration into tiny glimpses of the world we got in the film (what do the Skyjackers do? does Jupiter continue to have a relationship with the Aegis? does Caine get a pack again?), and I would be happy with space bureaucracy gen or something super shippy or something full of space princess/space wolf-splice sexytimes, Also while I don't want Balem resurrected, I'd be so happy for Titus and Kalique to make an appearance and I don't mind them being shipped with Jupiter (Kalique/Jupiter is my other fave just sayin'; and I'm also happy for Kalique/Titus to be the other ship if they do make an appearance) - but I don't want Jupiter/Caine to be broken up for it, or for it to happen without consent within the Jupiter/Caine ship.

Sated - Rebekah Weatherspoon 
Keira Kenney (Sated), Daniel Song (Sated)

I would love to see fic which explores more of their lives together either during or after the book. While the book itself is pretty explicit, I'd be very happy with non-explicit shippy fic exploring Keira's interest in Galaxis fandom or kickboxing, or Daniel's interest in pyrotechnics, but I would also love super porny fic too. One of the things that I found frustrating with Sated was that the initial dynamic I really liked at the beginning, where Keira topped and Daniel subbed, very quickly seemed to change by the end into Keira subbing all the time. So I would love to see more of Keira topping and getting to explore her fantasies with Daniel.

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi | Spirited Away 
Ogino Chihiro, Haku | Nigihayami Kohakunushi

This is basically one of my forever requests. I've been lucky enough to have some really amazing gifts for it already, but as this is the Ghibli film of my HEART, I am always hungry for more. This film has basically all of the things I love: protagonist leaving her everyday world for a stranger magical one, magic (a bathhouse of the gods!) alongside everyday mundaneity (CLEANING the bathhouse of the gods!) in that world, DRAGONS, coming of age themes, all the tiny magical elements of a Miyazaki film...

I would love to see future fic for this film about Chihiro as a teenager, a university student, an adult, any stage of her life really! Does she ever get to go back? What about Haku? I ship them like burning and would love to see their reunion (and perhaps courtship and eventual wedding and divine domestic bliss) but I would also be tremendously gloriously happy with genfic about Chihiro's life post-film. What does she do? What is her life like? How does the Land of Spirits bleed over into her life?

The Watchmaker of Filigree Street - Natasha Pulley 
Grace Carrow

I would really, really love future fic for Grace exploring her life after the book. Reference to Thaniel and Mori is fine, but I would prefer them not to form a significant part of the story as I feel the book already made a sufficient case for both of them. I would like Grace to get to achieve her dreams of Continuing to Study Science &amp; Conduct Strange Eldritch Experiments, but beyond that I am open to speculation: does she become Matsumoto's mistress? Does she just go as his friend and he acts as her wealthy patron? Does she make some other women friends once she's out of her usual milieu? Does she take up with an eccentric and wealthy OFC? Does she stay in Japan or does she keep travelling? Does she do her best to forget Mori or does she try to investigate the phenomenon of his abilities more closely? Does she ever see him and Thaniel again?

Shetland (TV) 
Jimmy Perez, Cassie Perez, Duncan Hunter

The relationship between Jimmy and Duncan (and by extension Cassie) is my favorite on the show. One of the things I love is that Duncan and Jimmy know each other well enough to know what hurts the other-- there's that exchange, I forget in what episode, where they fight and Jimmy acknowledges that he's a surly bastard. They don't seem to have the kind of relationship with anyone else in the show, and I love how fraught and complicated their interactions are. And I love how Cassie has different relationships with each of them, and gets different things from them, and works to establish her independence from them in different ways. Honestly, I ship the hell out of Jimmy/Duncan, but if you want to write gen that's fine too.

Whether you want to focus on the romantic and sexual aspects or the friendship is up to you -- either way, I'm here for the ride. Make it tumultuous, make it less than perfect, and I will be thoroughly satisfied. Please stick to the TV show canon; I have read the comics, but prefer this adaptation.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye, Tahani Al-Jamil

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love the universe of the Good Place and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, and I ship Eleanor/Chidi, Eleanor/Tahani, and Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani, so if that's up your alley, feel free to write about any or all of those ships. I don't have any preference among the three, and will be super pleased with anything you produce. I'm totally fine with smut, but I don't like dubcon (and I don't think it makes a ton of sense with these characters anyway?) I also really love Jason/Janet if that's something  you're interested in including. In terms of characters I really like, I love the entirety of Team Cockroach, Vicki, and Trevor.

In terms of specific prompts or ideas, I'd love to see any of the reboots from "Dance Dance Resolution" that are only hinted at - any of the times the gang went to Mindy St. Clair's, the Eleanor/Tahani soulmate attempt, and the one where the whole group is spying on the clown conveyor belt for whatever reason are all some of my favorite canon reboots. I'm also super open to any reboot scenario you want to go with. I especially like the idea of using reboots to do kind of trope-heavy AU stuff - there's a fic in the tag that's a university AU that I really like. 

If Eleanor hasn't shown Chidi the tape yet by the time you're writing this or there's a different way you'd like to imagine that interaction playing out, that would be super cool. I also like the idea of a version where Eleanor says I love you to Tahani. 

Cool, mindblowing stuff is definitely going to happen on the show after I write this, so if that inspires you to do something else, definitely do it. I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) 
Rebecca Bunch, Heather Davis, Valencia Perez, Greg Serrano

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love CEG and its characters and will be into whatever you produce.

I like romantic stuff, but with the caveat that I think shipping fics are a bit different for CEG given that the majority of the characters are not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. I like Rebecca/Greg, Rebecca/Valencia, and Rebecca/Heather most in fics when they explicitly acknowledge that the relationship is unhealthy (R/G especially) or, even better, both people are in a better place mentally and emotionally or are getting there together. I also love Heather/Valencia and Darryl/White Josh, and am totally fine with traditional, fluffy romance for them, because they deserve it and are way more ready for that than Rebecca. I'm totally okay with smut for any of the pairings listed, but I don't want dubcon. 

Although I couldn't list them, I love Paula, Darryl, White Josh, Hector, and Father Brah and would love to any of them included if it makes sense for your story. 

In terms of non-romantic stuff, I'm obsessed with the girl gang and would love to just see a story about them scheming against Josh, or really just hanging out. I would love to see a parody/takeoff of Gone Girl with Rebecca. I'd also be interested in seeing Rebecca and Greg just interact at this point without being romantic at all - maybe Greg hears about the wedding debacle and calls her/flies back to West Covina for some reason and sees her? I'm really curious as to whether Greg actually managed to break his patterns and succeed at Emory, and I miss Greg/Rebecca interactions, so if you want to take it in that direction, I'd be down.

Since the season hasn't started yet, it's really hard to predict what cool stuff might come up, so if there's anything that happens in s3 that you really want to write about, go for it! I want to emphasize that everything I've written is just suggestions to get you going if you're looking for inspiration - I will be 100% satisfied with anything you want to write about. I love this show, and I really just want to see more fic for it. 

Thanks!

Groundhog Day - Minchin/Rubin 
Phil Connors (Groundhog Day Musical), Rita Hanson (Groundhog Day Musical)

Hey, 

First things first, if you have a super cool idea outside the prompts/pairings I list, do it. I have some suggestions, but I really love this show  and will be into whatever you produce.

I ship Phil/Rita, and I like romantic fics, so if you're into that kind of thing, definitely go for it! I really  like AUs - some AU ideas I'm into are ones where the loop ends at a different time, Rita and Phil are both in the loop, completely different AUs like the college AU in the tag. I also like the idea of deleted scenes from within the loop - how did Phil interact with Rita during the time between If I Had My Time Again and Seeing You, when he was trying to help out the town? Did he ever tell Rita about the loop after the one day we see? Future fics are also great, especially ones where Phil has to figure out how to tell Rita about the loop or is kind of angsty about how much he already loves her when she really doesn't know him. 

If you're not into Phil/Rita or romance, I really love any stories you might have about life for Phil during or after the loop. I like fun stories during the Philandering time period where Phil gets up to some crazy stuff, stories about Phil going back to Punx at some point and what that would be like, or just whatever you can think of. In terms of Rita-centric fic, I'd love to see a fic from her pov at any point in the loop, especially the day Phil tells her about the loop, or literally anything about her background/family. I like the idea that Rita and Phil become best friends even if they're not romantic.

These are all just some ideas if you're looking for inspiration - I will love whatever you write! Thanks for indulging me, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Killjoys (TV) 

General likes: gen, friendships, found families, team as family, plot, character studies, humor, angst, banter, competence, magic, mythology, crossovers (as long as I’m familiar with the other fandom). I’m okay with relationships, but I’d prefer if they weren’t the main focus of the story.

General dislikes: explicit sex, rape/non con, A/B/O, mundane AU’s (i.e. coffee shop, high school), major character death (unless it’s canon, but even then I’m often in denial). Also, I’d rather not get a Christmas-themed fic.

There are so many things I love about this show, including the world building, the themes of found family and identity and recovery, and Turin’s hair. Team Awesome Force is a delight, as are all of the secondary characters (Fancy’s arc in season 3 was incredible).

One thing: I do feel strongly that David’s mental illness was not caused solely by his powers or by the presence of the Shadow King in his mind, so if you’re going to write a post-season 1 fic featuring him, I’d appreciate it if his schizophrenia wasn’t magically cured.

The Prestige (2006) 
Alfred Borden, Robert Angier

DNWs: Incest, Suicide, Rape/Noncon

Things I love about this canon: obsession, corruption, the mechanics of a magic trick, schemes of revenge, the flirtation with science and magic (via Tesla), and Twin Christian Bales (who have distinct personalities that shine through to the point where you can guess which is which when they’re on screen!) 

Ships: Canon ships only, please!

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast), Alex Reagan (The Black Tapes Podcast)

Two very different people with wildly varying moral truths investigating paranormal activities! Ruminations over journalism ethics and also the apocalypse! Sign me up!

I've always adored supernatural stories/investigation and Monster-of-the-Week type stories. Especially when they involve a straight-laced skeptic possibly finding out that he's got psychic powers and a lady journalist who dealing with how far she can (or will) go to find the truth at the bottom of whatever conspiracy.  I also cannot stress enough how much I'm a sucker for straight-laced, buttoned-up characters and pushing them to their breaking point. I don't think we've fully gotten to that point with Richard Strand...but how would we get there?

Daybreakers (2009) 
Edward Dalton

Ohh, this movie. The cold city noir/sun-soaked country aesthetic is like catnip to me.

I love ridiculously moody science fiction thinkpieces and this is...nearly there. Vampirism is a metaphor for our dependence on fossil fuels! Sam Neill is the literal bloodsucking embodiment of corporate greed! Ethan Hawke is conflicted and just wants to change the system, but HE IS THE SYSTEM! Fedoras are back in style! 

For what could have been just a gushy/gory vampire film, there's actually a lot of thoughtful worldbuilding that I would just love to see explored. A lot of little tidbits that were barely hinted at: the outbreak starting with a bat bite, what's happening globally/in third-world countries, the fact that forest fires are a major problem because starving vampires are going out hunting and then accidentally getting barbecued when they don't get out of the sun in time....

Iron Fist (TV) 
Ward Meachum (Iron Fist (TV)), Jeri Hogarth (Iron Fist (TV))

I'd really love to see Ward and Jeri interact more (no romantic relationships though, please). She's officially Rand's legal counsel now, right? And with the bonds of attorney/client privilege and what she already knows, she's probably one of the few people Ward would be able to talk to about the events of the series and (possibly) what happens after. So, please. Give me Ward trying to talk to literally the only person he can (since Joy's possibly hard to reach and Danny's off in K'un-Lun) while Jeri is Not Having It and trying to keep her head above water with this whole "superhero" thing.

Victoria (TV) 
Queen Victoria (1819 - 1901) (Victoria (TV)), Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Victoria (TV))

Victoria and Albert are fascinating to me as individuals and I also really love them together. Their marriage is so interesting and unique-- the power dynamics and how they fit together. I love how they became so Ride or Die for each other and at the same time they're still feeling out how they work together. It's very enemies-to-lovers-to-friends, how they initially clash but are honestly like 100% hot for each other. I adore that trope. Season 1 had really a lot of interesting UST. I'd love to see small problems with Victoria's marriage that she and Albert have to work through, or them just getting used to each other. I also really admire how they work together as a unit.

The Wolf Among Us 
Bigby Wolf (The Wolf Among Us)

This world is so interesting to me because you have the dichotomy of the "Happily Ever After" vs. what happens afterward, as well as some of these stories that were pretty dark to begin with. I really love the struggling underbelly of Fabletown and how people still fear Bigby Wolf because of what he's done in the past, but aren't quite to respecting him yet.  Bigby Wolf is very intriguing, especially at this stage in his relationship with Fabletown. (I do love my socially-awkward characters.)  

You can use whatever characters you like from the comics and the game, although I’m only specifically requesting Bigby. Have a favorite fable or urban legend that isn't in the game or comics but you'd like to use? DO IT! I'm very interested in hearing about your take on different fables/characters, it's one of the things that drew me to this game/comic series in the first place. (I also definitely ship Bigby/Snow, but I'd also be interested in Nerissa/Bigby, and I really loved his in-game interactions with Gren, Holly, and Woody as well.) If you do want additional fairytale inspiration, I loved The Wild Swans and One Eye, Two Eyes, Three Eyes as a kid.

Wiedźmin | The Witcher (Video Game) 
Emhyr var Emreis (Witcher Games)

Likes/Dislikes:

- Emhyr conquering everything and being all imperial and commanding, also competent

- I like scheming/cunning/in control Emhyr, also power dynamics

- bonus points if you somehow include Geralt (as a lover and/or ally), who has difficulty dealing with/getting used to all the protocol/servants/pomp/extravagance.

- no retired and/or preparing/planning to abdicate Emhyr please

- I generally like Emhyr being older and well established in his position as emperor, but if you want to do something set earlier, like Emhyr vs the Usurper or the subsequent power struggle for the throne (that led to Emhyr paving his ballroom with the gravestones of his political enemies), then that's fine as well.

- gen, het or slash welcome. Emhyr/Geralt is awesome, but Emhyr/his 3+ concubines is great as well. Or both. Heck if you want to you can even do Emhyr/Pavetta (just no endless pining once he's no longer Duny, please) or Emhyr/false Ciri.

- Regarding Ciri:
While I do quite like (both) Ciri(s), I'd prefer for her to only have a minor role in the story (if she is included at all), unless you want to go all the way and add both real and false Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, that could be fun. Especially if Emhyr marries false Cirilla and then later finds real Cirilla ...
Or even better, you could go super deep and dark and do Emhyr, Ciri &amp; the Slaughter of Cintra. Remember nobody, including the queen, knew that Emhyr had once been a prince of Cintra or that Queen Calanthe (who committed suicide with the rest of the city during the Slaughter of Cintra) was his mother-in-law ... AND it was assumed that he wanted to kidnap Ciri in order to marry her, not to get his daughter back.
So yeah, what were his thoughts, actions, motivations for letting things play out the way they did? What if he had done things differently? (like tell Calanthe that he was once Duny or that he had to invade in order to secure his position on the throne) What would the consequences have been?
See why I would prefer no Ciri? It makes me think too much and fall down a hole of what ifs ... :D

- no total AUs, some modifications are fine (like books vs games) but no Modern AUs etc please

Damien (TV) 
Damien Thorn

Likes/Dislikes:
- no fluffy romance please, the darker/creepier the better
- gen, het or slash all welcome
- no AUs please
- no Supernatural crossovers please, other crossovers are fine but not necessary

Prompts:

- Damien's childhood in the White House (as the show uses actual footage from the original movie, I consider all of it canon, including the very end where POTUS gets custody of Damien after his parent's deaths)

- How does young Damien's super privileged environment of politicians and trust fund kids react to him running off to become a war photographer of all things?

- Damien's life as a war photographer pre-series and how his presence in war zones unknowingly makes everything worse

- What happens in the aftermath of the Season 1 finale? Can be from anyone's POV, the darker the better (that's true for all prompts)


Request 3 by araline
The Young Pope (TV) 
Andrew Dussolier, Lenny Belardo

Story does not have to include all requested characters, just one is totally fine!

Likes/Dislikes:
- Andrew is very welcome to do all of Honduras/Rome/mankind separately or simultaneously in any and all combinations and positions, but please, PLEASE keep Lenny asexual and aromantic.
- also no total AUs, Andrew (if included) has to be a cardinal and Lenny (if included) has to be the pope
- crossovers are welcome as long as it isn't with Supernatural

Prompts:

- Andrew and/or Lenny's secret incognito adventures: this can take place either during THAT night in Episode 5, or some other time, like Andrew going out and about in Honduras (orgies optional). Anything goes as long as the people he/they are interacting with don't know about them being a cardinal/the pope for at least part of the story

- Lenny actually is a saint and can perform true miracles: how does the world react? how does the church make use of this?

- Lenny is the Antichrist: will anyone figure it out in time or does the world believe he's a saint till the end?

- Andrew isn't killed: what happens instead/what consequences does this have?

Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Goosefat Bill (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Kung Fu George (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

I'd be really happy with anything you decided to write for this fandom! Maybe a fic that plays with Arthurian legend with a Guy Ritchie twist, or some extra info on Arthur's life growing up, or how he grows into being a king after the end of the film. You don't have to use all the characters I nominated, or you can definitely use more if you want! Gen is lovely, or if you want to go the ship route I ship both Arthur/Mage and Arthur/Goosefat Bill and would be happy to receive either.

Hustle Cat 

Give me all the characters of Hustle Cat! I love them all. I'd love to see any of them in their day to lives (yes, including Nacht), especially how the "cursed cats" cope after falling under the curse. An AU where Avery does fall under the curse temporarily and studies the book whenever they can - and in the meantime being part of the "Jelly Donut and Albatross" (or whatever name you choose for cat!Avery) show. Graves teaching Avery to talk to cats or other magic. Mason just being with her grandpa. Hayes goes on a date to his favorite non-work restaurant with a date after the end.

I'm a bit squicked out by Avery/Graves, so I'd prefer friendship fic between the two. Pairing Avery (any gender) with any of their coworkers is fine.

An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Miles (An Old Fashioned Unicorn's Guide to Courtship)

I love all the cliches in this story and how Alicia deals with them, but I love Miles even more. Alicia might be the focus of the story, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her at all, but it's Miles that is the most interesting. I have a soft spot for accountants and it's great that he uses an accountant's skills to get them through the castle, and also how he tries to save the kingdom as best he can. So, write me Miles wanting to just get back to the kingdom, desperately trying to save it, just Miles being Miles and doing the best he can!

Belsomra "Cats and Dogs" Commercial 

I have a soft spot for both cats and dogs, and love this commercial! What I would like to see is the relationship between the sleep cats, the wake dogs, and the owners - do you have to feed the things? What do you feed them with?  Does everybody get their own personal sleep cats and wake dogs? How would the world be different if you have these two animals all your life - can they be taken away from you, and what would happen to you?

Jonathan Sims, Martin Blackwood, Elias Bouchard

Note: Using just Jon+Martin or just Jon+Elias rather than all three is fine for this one!
DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I like pretty much anything with Jon/Martin or Jon/Elias, whether that's just one of them or both existing at the same time (though no Jon/Martin/Elias or Martin/Elias, in that case)! Non-shippy is good too.

With Jon and Martin, I'd particularly enjoy things set around when Martin was living in the archives, after Prentiss' attack, or some kind of fix-it after the end of season two. Moments where Jon is slightly less prickly and horrible to Martin are A+.

With Jon and Elias, messed-up things post-s2 or things pre-s2-finale where Elias is shady as hell and Jon doesn't realize are both great.

Alternatively, I'm also weirdly attached to coffeeshop AU where Jonathan Sims is the manager who should definitely never be allowed to interact with customers but has to anyway, if you feel like something more mundane, and I'm down for things involving the other assistants too in that case!

Other general things I like: D/s (exclusively with sub Jon), trans guy Jon (written so that it's pretty much only relevant if you're writing porn), hurt/comfort.

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested ships, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

I enjoyed Peter and James' relationship, so that's the main thing I'd be looking for re Peter Darling fic - particularly either more interaction set in the middle of the book, or exploring things after the end between them and how things work out back in the real world.

I'd also be interested in an AU where Neverland was more complete and they didn't end up leaving, particularly something where the relationship stayed more on the Pan/Hook side of things than the Peter/James side!

Night World - L. J. Smith 
Ash Redfern

DNWs: Noncon, non-canonical death, infidelity, humiliation, un-requested AUs, crossovers, issuefic.

Ash is my favorite character by a long way - everything about his aesthetic and the fact that he's trying to better himself and just. Pretty much anything, honestly?

I ship him with Poppy and Mary-Lynnette, so if you're looking to write shipfic then one of those is what I'd be looking for! Gen is also good - him interacting with Circle Daybreak, what he's doing to try to better himself and make up for his past, etc etc

I like canon divergent AUs for Night World - the main ones that are coming to mind are either 'AU where Ash is Poppy's soulmate, not James' (though please either handwave or tie up Poppy/James in that case, because infidelity is a big DNW and I'm not into it as an OT3!) or 'AU where Mary-Lynnette didn't stay human after Daughters of Darkness'.

Cormoran Strike Series - Robert Galbraith 
Cormoran Strike, Robin Ellacott

More details in my letter!

Casefic - Strike and Robin are hired to investigate something, but it turns out to be more than it first appears.

Any of my fave fanfic tropes - undercover as married, stakeouts, forced bed sharing, etc. I feel this is a couple ripe for the classic tropes!

Also, Trapped Together - what happens if they are stuck somewhere and can’t escape?

Road trip hunting a serial killer the police don’t believe exists.

Robin’s first solo case as partner turns into a bit of a mess.

A historical AU of some kind would be fun! WW1 era, noir from the 40s, Victorian…any, really!)

A slightly more specific casefic prompt with an added side of kink: A hotel manager hires Strike to investigate which of his employees is placing cameras in the guests’ rooms. Only thing is, he wants them to be discrete so the culprit doesn’t know they are onto him, so Strike ropes Robin in to play his wife and they check into the hotel. Problem is, to be convincing they have to play a couple even in private, because of the cameras watching their every move…

    Post-Career of Evil Prompts (Spoilers!)

    Robin doesn’t marry Matthew. I don’t mind how you do it - whether you let her find out about him deleting her messages before the ceremony and she calls it off; if she punches Matthew in the face at the altar; if she says “actually, I don’t” and just walks away from the asshole…any of the above! I just don’t want her legally bound to that douche. Strike can definitely help with this if you like.

A lot of people from Strike’s past show up in CoE. Do any others try to exact revenge?

Matthew is killed. The police think Robin did it. And Strike’s not so sure she didn’t…

The Awakening (2011) 
Florence Cathcart, Robert Mallory

More details in my letter!

Florence is canon into voyeurism (both in that she liked watching Robert, and liked the idea of him watching her) - so what is the sex life with Robert like going forward? Does she like to watch and be watched? (Either way, I see her as liking to be in control of it, not so much the idea of strangers watching her, or it being done without her consent)

Post-movie, Florence and Robert are separated for a time - do they write each other letters?

Florence now believes in ghosts. Where does that leave her career? Does she still hunt down the fakes, as well as the real things? Does Robert come with her? Or do people come to her with their supernatural troubles?

Robert is nervous about proposing, but Florence is getting impatient.

On their honeymoon, they go to some of the oldest places in Europe. Surely there are ghosts lurking in every corner. What kind of trouble do they get into?

Florence Cathcart: Demon Hunter (Have fun with it! If ghosts exist, why not demons?)

A missing scene from the film with additional/bonus pining?

I do really want a happy ending here for Florence and Robert, but if you want to do something interesting with the hints that she might be a ghost herself at the end of the film, I’ll be interested if you can make it work.

The canon ended just as they got to the interesting bit of the relationship. What happens next? How do they navigate this new relationship as they were just getting used to the old one?

Their brush with crime has given them a taste of a more interesting life. What happens when someone else gets murdered? Do they investigate themselves?

Alfred doesn’t want to spend his newly acquired money on anyone but Louisa and Alfie. How does she feel about this?

What would their first time be like? Are they traditional (waiting until after marriage) or do they decide to be more unconventional? (I imagine that Louisa would be a bit happier to have sex before marriage - not wanting to shackle herself to another man so soon. But Alfred seems like he’d be a little more traditional. Who would win that battle?)

Miss Marple comes back for a visit and attracts some trouble. How do they deal with it?

Does Miss Marple ask for help with a case?

Lots of people died at Greenshaw’s Folly. What if the place is now haunted?

Dislikes/DNWs: Miserable endings. Major character death. Baby/Pregnancy/kidfic. Drugs use/drug mentions/addiction. Self harm/abuse. Non-con/rape. Heavy kink. A/B/O. M-Preg. Incest. Bestiality, animal harm etc. Nothing underage. Unbalanced power dynamics. 1st person POV (unless for epistolary). Not big on high school AUs or Rock band AUs.

Boston Legal 
Denny Crane (Boston Legal), Alan Shore (Boston Legal)

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! I love the way Alan and Denny love each other. They can and do disagree and about a lot of things, but they really do complete each other, and they both know it. I would love to see almost anything with them, set any time. (Please nothing that focuses on Denny's advancing illness per se.) A slice of life, Coast Guard adventures, curtainfic, kittenfic, road trip, new client, gone fishin', -- anything will make me happy. I miss these two a lot. &lt;3

Peacemakers (2003) 
Larimer Finch, Jared Stone

Slash or warm gen, any rating, please! Finch and Stone are rock-solid favorites of mine, and I miss them a lot. Anything you want to write, from a case story to them sitting on the porch one day watching the townsfolk go by, from courtroom session to a slice of life, from wacky hijinks to intimate vulnerability -- it's all good. I just love the connection between these two, and as long as that's there, I'll be happy.

The Slipper and the Rose (1976) 
Prince Edward (The Slipper and the Rose (1976)), John (The Slipper and the Rose (1976))

Slash or gen, any rating, please! Edward and John are a charming mystery in the middle of a charming movie. They're clearly very close and comfortable with each other (despite the usual constraints of position and positioning), but at the same time don't actually seem to know that much about each other, like they've only recently met. I would love to see more about them together that goes into that closeness and newness - anything from quiet mutual snark at a function to a walk in the garden to teaming up in an incognito brawl at a tavern to their first meeting to anything at all. Just more of these two, please. &lt;3

Letter: http://arduinna.dreamwidth.org/105770.html

Tango & Cash (1989) 
Gabriel Cash, Raymond Tango

Slash or gen, any rating, please! I love these two, how they’re both so incredibly competent and confident, and how they’re that much better together no matter how much they would rather not admit it. I would love to see more of them together, however that happens - a case, a night on the town, competing at the firing range, a "grill the best burger" challenge - anything. Snark and banter and growing respect &amp; trust are a fantastic combination.

Valdemar Series - Mercedes Lackey 
Kethry (Valdemar), Tarma shena Tale'sedrin

Gen, any rating, please! Tarma and Kethry are my all-time favorite Lackey characters: smart, practical/pragmatic, competent and determined to keep training/learning to maintain and improve on that competence, utterly loyal to each other, wry, self-aware – I just love them. And I love their relationship, built on bedrock but one they know they need to pay attention to (like the way Tarma has to make sure she doesn't wrap fully capable Kethry in cotton wool, just because she's promised to be the mother of Tarma's renewed tribe). I'd love anything about them: the early days of their lives as she'enedran and each of them adapting to suddenly knowing they'll never be alone again; off on a job (either a regular for-hire job, or something Need drives them to); learning to be part of a bigger mercenary force; their lives as teachers and running a school; time among the Clans; hanging out at an inn or resupplying at a marketplace; dealing with a storm out in the open – whatever may strike your fancy, I'm all for it.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

(I'm going to be away from a computer until around October 12, but after that I should have a Dear Yuletide Author letter up for you over on aria at dreamwidth! Meanwhile, a couple of details here:)

I'd love something post-series that addresses how exactly Damen and Laurent start the political process of uniting their kingdoms -- how do they reconcile their cultures? What are they going to do about an heir/the long-term viability of ruling together? How do their various ways of being politically competent compliment each other? Otoh if you don't want to do plotty politicking, any nice post-series slice-of-life with the two of them (porny or not!) would also/or instead be a delight.


Request 2 by Aria
Wayfarers Series - Becky Chambers 
Rosemary Harper, Sissix Seshkethet, Dr. Chef (Wayfarers Series), Ohan (Wayfarers Series)

Again, something post-series would be great! I'd love a story about the crew dealing with Ohan as a single entity, and how the dynamics among them change; if you want to do something plotty, I'd be fascinated to see how Ohan feels post-virus, and whether he is content to just stay on the ship or wants to connect with the others of his species who are also single entities now. I'm also up for anything about Dr. Chef (I love Dr. Chef so much!) or indeed anything about the crew as a family. I'd also be really into a story about Rosemary and Sissix's relationship -- visiting Sissix's relatives, or having Sissix hang out with some humans, or just a day in the life with the two of them, whatever! Honestly anything about the Wayfarer crew as found family would be wonderful.


Request 3 by Aria
Provenance - Ann Leckie 
Tic Uisine, Garal Ket | Pahlad Budrakim, Ingray Aughskold, Taucris Ithesta

I would love anything about any of these ridiculous people! How does the Tic/Garal and Ingray/Taucris double date go? What adventures do Tic and Garal get up to together? What's Ingray's life like after the events of the book? Do any of them end up going to the Conclave? These are all just suggestions off the top of my head, really anything about any of them would be lovely.


Request 4 by Aria
Crimson Peak (2015) 
Thomas Sharpe, Lucille Sharpe, Edith Cushing

Sorry, this is one of my more specific requests! What I'd really love from a Crimson Peak story is a weird gothic Thomas/Lucille/Edith threesome, though I have no preference for whether this is an AU where no one is trying to kill anyone or an extra layer to the existing story. If a weird gothic threesome really isn't your jam, though, that's okay! I'd also take a story about Thomas and Lucille before Edith turned up, or a story about Edith writing her sensational novel after the events of the movie, etc.


Request 5 by Aria
The Road to El Dorado (2000) 
Tulio (Road to El Dorado), Miguel (Road to El Dorado), Chel (Road to El Dorado)

I would love really any story about these three! An OT3 would be particularly delightful, as would a ridiculous heist, but I'd also take a story about any of them pre-movie, or really whatever strikes your fancy.

Sengoku Basara 

Preferred focus on Mitsunari and Ieyasu as a ship, please! I like them in any ways and all ways. Fluffy stories in their younger days is good. Tragic/angsty, even character death is totally acceptable too. Sexy times is good, Ieyasu topping Mitsunari is good. Ieyasu being sweet and gentle and Mitsunari being an angry tsundere kitty is good. Squicks are: no sexy times with them as small children, no rape. Thank you dear writier!

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

Okay, I chose Arthur and the Mage, and honestly, I just enjoy their relationship. I enjoy the way she challenges him but also supports him, and how he respects her abilities and doesn't treat her like the chick in the group. So, you could do pretty much anything with these two and it'd be fine.

BUT. Let me give you another option that I would be OVER THE FUCKING MOON about. Tell me ANYTHING about Arthur's relationship with the women who raised him. It can be a past-fic during his childhood, it can be a fic predicated upon the idea that some of them survived and he gives them jobs in the kingdom, it can be ANYTHING about them and I will do a Dance of Happy. Many times over.

Ready Player One - Ernest Cline 
Art3mis | Samantha Cook, Aech | Helen Harris, Shoto | Akihide Karatsu

I feel like apologizing if you matched with me on this, because nine times out of ten, when I want fanfic, it's because I really liked the universe, and I just want more. That tenth time is when the universe drove me crazy, and I want someone to fix it a little. Guess which one this is?

So, as you probably noticed, I listed Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto as my characters of choice. Give me ANYTHING with these characters in a future fic and I will be pleased as punch. Maybe Art3mis works on helping women get into coding and researhing alternate fuel sources? Maybe Aech finds a way to engage young AA persons in their OWN 70s-80s-90s culture (or just discovers how much of it there IS, now that she's done living her life for a white dude's quest) or something like that for queer teens? Maybe Shoto finds ways to honor Daito's life, to help other Japanese teenagers who are in similar situations? Whatever, just. Tell me about these characters living their lives now that they have safety and cash and their own maneuverability.

Batwoman (Comic) 

In my dreams of dreams of dreams, I would really like a story about Kate's Judaism. And, like, something that's not Hanukah. What does she dress up as on Purim? What's her favorite filling for hamentashen? Does she eat nothing but ice cream on Shavuot and consistently tell the others it's a religious requirement? Does she make the family have a picnic every Lag B'Omer? What's a Shabbat dinner at Kate's like? Does she plan apple picking field trips before Rosh Hashanah? What are the things she atones for during Yom Kippur? Does she kidnap and make Damian help decorate the sukkah at her shul? Anything that's just a snippet of her being Jewish and I would cry from happy until I flooded my home state.

But, if that's super not your thing, you can also just tell me a story about Kate being The Gay and I will also be super happy. Like, tell me all about how getting kicked out over DADT felt, or how she felt when it was repealed, or where she was when the Sup Ct decision making gay marriage legal was, or...whatever, honestly.

I love the combination of humor and gore in the show.  I'd like to see a scene or story where one or both of them reveals that they care, either romantically or platonically.  My favorite way to do this is through injury or some kind.  I'd love to see Alucard have to admit he needs help, for instance, or Trevor forced to admit he actually trusts the dhampir.

The Death of the Necromancer - Martha Wells 
Arisilde Damal (The Death of the Necromancer)

Romance fully optional.  I really wanted a scene with Nicholas and Arisilde, but for some reason Nichloas is in the tag set but when I try to submit it says he's not allowed.

I always wanted MORE for these two in the book.  Anything where they show their concern/regard for each other would be great, especially Arisilde getting a chance to help Nicholas in some way.  I always loved the contrast between Ari, the extremely powerful pacifist, and Nicholas, who is mostly average but ruthless.  Everyone underestimates Ari, even Nicholas, so something where he gets to prove himself maybe?  He has been a favorite character of mine for about 20 years so I'd love to see him again.

Nightrunner Series - Lynn Flewelling 
Alec í Amasa, Seregil í Korit

I loved this series so much, for much longer than I should have, and I still think the first 2 books are great.  I love the characters and the world, but I came to find the books themselves boring after the high stakes of the first two.  I felt like the series stopped holding my interest because the author was no longer willing to have Alec and Seregil face real dangers.  I never felt like there was any actual threat of death or bodily harm to either of them, much less tension in their relationship, so I'd like to see something involving that.  I always liked to see Seregil  hurt or in trouble.

Swordspoint was one of my favorite books growing up and I still reread it sometimes just because I loved Alec and Richard so much.  I loved how Alec was such an asshole but still managed to show his love for Richard.  I always wanted to see him push something too far, get Richard in a little too much trouble, and see how he would handle Richard getting hurt in a duel (even if it was just a regular fight).  I understand why she did it, but I've always been sad that Richard died off screen and of natural causes as well.  Would love an "alternate" death scene for him.

This is such a cute book I can't believe I'd never heard of it until this year!  Also that it never had any sequels is a crime.

I just love Aaron and Darvish and I want to see them together.  Maybe a little jealousy or worry on Darvish's part, him having to go after Aaron either physically to save him or emotionally to win him.  Not really looking for sex but maybe some romance.  I have no issue with Chandra being in the story, I just don't require her- I do like her.

So Doctrine of Labyrinths is my FAVORITE series of books.

I love the characters, the deep and screwed up love they have, the intricate world building...all of it.  I would love any kind of tender moment between them, set anywhere during or after the series.  I especially like Mildmay rescuing or defending Felix, and there are a few parts of the books I'd love to see reworked along those lines.

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 
Attolia (Queen's Thief)

Irene! I think the way Megan Whalen Turner scrupulously limits our exposure to Irene and her thought process is genius, but it also leaves me...well, pretty tantalized. So I would love more of her - of her inner world, her decision-making, her her experience. 

I love her steely determination and moral ambiguity, the way we see how she's had to rigidly control her image and emotions and self-presentation in order to maintain her throne and defend her people, and the glimpse of backstory we get in <i>The Queen of Attolia</i> is devastating. If you want to run with that and show us more scenes of Irene's self-development and ascension to power, maybe places where she slipped and had to regain control, that would be awesome. 

I would also, like probably everyone else who reads and loves these books, be into more shippy Irene/Gen stuff (the scene in The King of Attolia where they're dancing and he pulls the hairpins out of her hair one by one until it cascades down...sexiest thing I've read in a long time), especially playing with how they navigated their messy, traumatic history together and what it means to love one another and yet to have hurt each other so much. 

Irene and Helen/Eddis interaction would also be very much welcome (platonic or not - though if you do ship them, I'd prefer you don't break Irene and Gen up to do that); I'd love to see an exploration of how they navigate their different relations to queenship and authority, and how they get to the type of trust and working relationship we see in <i>A Conspiracy of Kings</i>.

Penny Dreadful (TV) 
Vanessa Ives (Penny Dreadful), Hecate Poole (Penny Dreadful)

So. I adored <i>Penny Dreadful</i> but that moment in S2 when Vanessa and Hecate see each other for the first time across the crowded ballroom, and then Vanessa starts hallucinating blood raining from the ceiling? And then they <i>never</i> interact again? Most frustrating tease ever.

I would be interested in any ideas you have for giving us the interaction the show didn't, and am open to whatever directions you want them to go in. Enemies-to-allies(-to maybe lovers)? Darkfic of their continued battle, or of one taking the other captive? Deliciously fucked-up family dynamics with Evelyn and Sir Malcolm continuing their relationship? I could think of scenarios upon scenarios, but I'm really open to wherever your imagination takes you. Likewise, I'd be totally into something shippy with them, but just as equally interesting in gen that deals with their parallel journeys towards understanding their own agency in these epic mystical conflicts into which they were both dragged. I'm into the question of how their volatile and intense personalities might play off each other; please do run with it.

I love both Vanessa and Hecate as trauma survivors who are messy and ugly in their survival, who lash out and hurt others but are also trying to figure out how to live in their world, with their experiences. <i>Penny Dreadful</i> is also an amazing ensemble cast, and I would be happy to see other characters making appearances (maybe especially Seward, Dracula, Evelyn - or Brona/Lily, who doesn't really interact much with either of these women, would also be an interesting counterpoint), but I'd prefer the focus of whatever you write stay primarily on Hecate and Vanessa, especially rather than the male characters that tend to get more attention in our fandom. Likewise, I'm fine with Vanessa/Ethan, but if that pairing is present, I'd rather it not be the main center of the fic.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alabaster (Broken Earth)

Alabaster is my favorite, and makes my heart hurt and rejoice all at once. I know there were very good reasons for his limited presence in <i>The Stone Sky,</i> but I <i>miss</i> him.

So, please, give me more Alabaster! For this more probably than for my other requests I have a strong desire to see my requested character happy and in love, and if you want to go there I would be delighted (I loved loved loved Alabaster/Innon/Syenite, which was finished all too quickly for my wishes), but I would also be very happy to read more about his process of learning and exploration, his reckless and brilliant decisions.

<i>Broken Earth</i> has such dense, textural world-building, which we get largely from Essun and Nassun's perspectives, and I'd be really excited to see what some of the more haunting and mysterious aspects of the Stillness are like for Alabaster to inhabit. In particular, the Guardians are amazingly disturbing, and Alabaster's particular relationship with his Guardian, who he destroys and also saves, was really intriguing to me - I'd love to read something about what it was like for him to exert that kind of power, how much his choice came out of vengeance or self-preservation or compassion (which are so tangled up for him in all his decisions, really?), how he experiences the formalized and violence hierarchy which is the Guardian/orogene relationship.

Another period of his life which I'd really love fic about is his transformation into a Stone-Eater. I know we hear that his consciousness and memory are altered, perhaps unrecognizably from their original state, and I'd be curious to read an exploration of what that might be like for him, from the inside. Is their an ecstasy to that transformation, or a terror, or a relief? What does it mean for him as a culmination to all the losses of his human life? I'd love to read anything you come up with.

Les liaisons dangereuses | Dangerous Liaisons - Choderlos de Laclos 
Madame de Tourvel (Laclos), Marquise de Merteuil (Laclos)

The Merteuil and Tourvel never really interact in <i>Les liaisons dangereuses</i>! This has always bothered me. We get Mertueil making snide remarks about Tourvel's clothing, we know they've interacted socially, we know Merteuil is devouring all the details of Tourvel's conquest but...that's really all we get, for the most part. And I always wanted more; it felt like a missing piece to the elaborate polygon of relationships which is this book.

I feel like Tourvel is the moral center of the book in a lot of ways, and Merteuil's underestimation of her is crucial to the plot, but also means their interaction could be electric and exciting. Tourvel has actual principles, and Merteuil doesn't believe in those principles! What would that look like between them? Merteuil/Tourvel would be really cool, whether it entailed a straightforward power dynamic with Merteuil in control or something more unexpected and shifting. But a more ideological or intellectual contest would also really excite me. What if Tourvel became aware of the extent of Merteuil's manipulations in her life and decided to do something about it? What if Merteuil decided to mess with Valmont by manipulating Tourvel directly? What if Tourvel someone ended up as a support to Cecile, and Merteuil had to step in order to keep her long game moving? I'd be okay with some degree of Tourvel/Valmont/Merteuil for this prompt, but I'd prefer for the interactions between the women to be foregrounded, even if Valmont is the vehicle to get them there.

Chronicles of Prydain - Lloyd Alexander 
Eilonwy (Chronicles of Prydain)

Eilonwy is the beloved heroine of my childhood, and I so, so, so want more of her.

There are a lot of potential gaps to fill to do with Eilonwy's experience during different parts of the series, and I would be interested in reading about ideas for any of them; <i>Prydain</i> stays so tightly within Taran's perspective that there's a lot of room to be opened up. I am particularly interested in Eilonwy's relationship to her own magic and heritage and history, how she comes to integrate those elements into her sense of herself either during or after the series. Eilonwy has a wonderful, delightful whimsy and way of moving through the world but she is also holds a lot of complex contradictions in her identity, and it would be amazing to have some of those drawn out (those if you want to keep Alexander's tone of whimsy, I'd be perfectly happy to have that as well!).

I am also so, so interested in Eilonwy's relationship to Achren, both before the series and during Castle of Llyr. Achren was probably my first childhood literary crush, and I've always been curious what it would have been like for Eilonwy to grow up around this charismatic, gorgeous, powerful sorceress who was frankly pretty horribly to her while also (I imagine?) being something of a role model. With this prompt I'd be happy with something that stays within the type of tone and content of the series, but also with something darker and messier, if you want to go there. Dark!Eilonwy AU where she stays working with Achren after the abduction in <i>Llyr</i> (either of her own free will or through magic compulsion) would awesome and exciting and if you wanted to write fucked-up Achren/Eilonwy I would be totally into it (though, if you do so, please keep that with Eilonwy either at the age she is in <i>Llyr</i> or older, though I know the mentor/student dynamics are unavoidable and certainly part of the interest).

Dungeons and Dragons (Cartoon) 
Eric "the Cavalier"

This is one of my perennials because I never get enough! I would love Eric on his way to paladinhood (possibly kicking and screaming the whole way there), I'd also love Eric paired with pretty much any of the characters. 

Maybe a story about them getting home, and Eric becoming a paladin in OUR world, and having to make a choice to go back? I'd be interested to see him devoting himself to a real-world religion he was raised in (that he and his family possibly didn't take seriously) rather than to a Realm-based deity. 

(And as I write this, it occurs to me that Eric could be Jewish--I'd love to see him as a Jewish paladin! I don't see any reason he should kvetch any less just because he's got faith. :D But I totally understand if you don't feel comfortable writing that idea, so don't hesitate to give it a miss.)

I would love Menolly/Robinton if you can do it. I'm a fan of the good old "fire lizard mating flight made them do it" trope, but I'd also love to see Menolly deciding what she wants and asserting herself a bit more to do it. If not, I'd also love a story about Menolly having some kind of Harper adventure. Please no Menolly/Sebell, thanks (except if it's in the context of an overall Menolly/Robinton story in which case do whatever you want). I would also slightly prefer if you stick to the canon of the original Harper Hall trilogy and the original Dragonriders trilogy -- if you have some burning idea using AIVAS or something else out of the later canon go for it, but the tone of the later books feels so different to me, and they don't live in my heart the same way.

Dune Series - Frank Herbert 
Paul Atreides (Dune - Herbert), Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Dune - Herbert), Stilgar Ben Fifrawi (Dune - Herbert)

Paul is such a fascinating character and his power is equally fascinating. I would love a story that plays with it more, the way it sets him apart from humanity. You don't have to use either Feyd or Stilgar specifically, they just feel like interesting points of contact. 

One AU idea to spark you: if the Harkonnens hadn't killed Paul, if eg the Baron had been quietly forced by the Emperor or the Bene Gesserit to take Paul into his own house--I'd love a story about his power growing in that hostile environment, and how the people who see it react as this terrifying power swells out of their midst when it is a direct threat to them rather than a power aimed at their enemies. I can totally go to a Paul/Feyd place if you want to. 

If that doesn't spark you, maybe a story from Stilgar's POV seeing Paul's powers grow over the course of the period in the book on the way to the moment when he takes the Water of Life. 

One big request: please NOT the disgusting caricaturish Harkonnens of the movie if you use them, I prefer the far more compelling ones of the book.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Gaius Octavian (Rome 2005), Titus Pullo (Rome 2005), Lucius Vorenus (Rome 2005)

I was so disappointed in the way the show handled Octavian in S2. I loved young Octavian and his perception and brilliance, and then it felt to me like they decided to tell a story about how hot and awesome Mark Antony was (not wrong), but to make his fall more tragic, they turned it into a struggle between him as a kind of representative of pleasure and passion and Octavian as a weirdly repressed creep who made a bunch of stupid decisions and then won just because. 

All of which is to say: tell me a different story about Octavian as a young man? Anything you like, as long as Octavian is competent and thoughtful and thinking of Rome and the future. Feel free to ignore canon and history too for that matter. 

If that doesn't work for you, I would also love a Pullo/Vorenus story (doesn't have to be slash but yay if you can) set basically any time in the series. Optimistic ending preferred.

Ирония судьбы | The Irony of Fate (Movies)

We saw the hilarious surprise of Zhenya's friends when they realised that their friend's choice of fiancée had changed literally overnight. What about Nadya's colleagues, though? How would they react if they learned that the "Ippolit" they'd greeted so joyously was really Zhenya?

That's just one idea I had, but really, I'd love to read any fic that immediately follows the movie and keeps the film's perfect blend of pleasure, poignancy, and poetry.

At Land (1944) 

This 15-minute film is my favourite of Maya Deren's works and filled with scope for story, I think, because it's wholly silent while offering many provocative and imagination-stirring images. Could you write a story about what's happening during a scene? An inner monologue for one of the characters? A scene that took place before or after the images we see? A poem based upon the work? I'm really open to your creativity here and would be thrilled to read anything that the film inspires you to write.

Her narrating voice was wonderful, and she's a character I'd like to know a little better!

Flodskörden | Things from the Flood - Simon Stålenhag 

Possible prompts, if you’re looking for specific inspiration (some cloned from last year’s letter):

“Things from the Flood” is the start of this particular story arc - the sudden emergence of gory biotech with a mind of its own. What’s it like to be there at the outset?

The image texts suggest some form of xenomorphic evolution of native species. What are the implications for humans?

What’s the female police officer’s story? What has she found? Where does her job take her next?

The pictures suggest that Annika's boyfriend goes into one of the machines alone. What does he see inside? How does it change him? His appearance in the later image suggests he's not quite himself, but are the repercussions of going inside short-lived, or something he'll have to deal with for a while. Does he come out the same person at all? (Hello, cloned boyfriend!?) How much do they know about what they were exploring and what happened to him (if anything did)?

Why? What led Annika and her boyfriend to head out to these locations. A simple whim, or some larger purpose? Does Annika have an agenda of her own? Did she persuade her boyfriend to go inside? Did they find something in the first machine that led to them going to the towers/teleporters/biomachines?

What's in the pipes? Where's all that energy going? What are the other machines for? Why the gore? Why is the wiring/pipework so biological and haphazard in appearance?

Who (or what) are the (other?) victims of the machine - or is the gore part of the machine itself? Is that biological waste going anywhere? Will it do anything more than just sit there in a pool?

What role does Annika's relationship with her boyfriend play in this story? WHO needs to talk about Annika? Why? Where are the lovers in the final image? What kind of machine/structure is that, and what is its purpose?

Human society becomes accustomed to the new tech. But what’s the price?

The roadworker wearing the stimulus headgear - is he relaxing between shifts, or is it part of his job? What is he seeing/doing beneath the mask? What’s his life like outside of work?

Maybe the roadworker isn’t a roadworker. Maybe it’s some kind of scheme to hack or infiltrate the towers in the background. Maybe his colleagues aren’t resting. Maybe they’re dead, or suborned.

These characters have similar roles in their respective hierarchies - the early personification of power.

Song of the Sea (2014) 

I love how much all the characters grow, and would love to see that growth continue in a post-canon fic, or explored in a moment of realisation within the flow of the film itself. Or how Conor and Bronagh met, how they melded the magic of what she is into their everyday lives. Ben and Saoirse and Conor post-canon, and how their relationships evolve. How they feel about the sea, and the magic that's no longer such a tangible part of it. Macha and Mac Lir - the love and compassion that drove both of them, the safety in retreating to a life of stone, how they mirror Granny and Conor in the way Granny is so intent on safety at all costs and how Conor has pretty much stopped feeling at all. (Yeah, they're very obviously direct archetypes of the mythology, but how overtly do they understand what they are?)

I don't really want to give too many specific prompts for this, because otherwise I'll want to start writing them myself, and in a fandom this tiny what I want most of all is to see what makes this film so special for YOU. I trust you. Write the fic of your heart, please.

Rules of Summer - Shaun Tan 
Younger boy (Rules of Summer), Older boy (Rules of Summer)

What I’d love in a story for this fandom… okay, brace yourself for a brain-dump of ideas rather than a nice, clean set of bullet points.

Not a fic that simply retells a scene in more words, but one that unpicks it and makes the layers resonate. How does the (possibly allegorical) fantasy interleave with the boys’ lives before, after, or even (in a mundane, real-world setting) during the story? How do the ‘rules’ compare with the other rules of adulthood - and those of childhood? Why do these rules matter? What happens when you break them? How do the rules stay with the boys in later life?

What does the Crow want? Why is it always there? Where were the Crow’s people taking the younger boy? What was the older boy offered in exchange? What happens if you do miss the last day of summer, or if you can’t find your way back?

How about an AU where the book’s rules are broken and different rules learned? (Feel free to go full-on Crueltide with that, if it takes your fancy.) Or, the interpretation where the setting is more of a portal-world fantasy. How did the boys stumble into it, and do they ever return? Does anything ever come out of the summer-world into the real-world? Crossovers with mythology? Or with other portal fantasies (e.g. Narnia, Terabithia, Cooper’s Seaward, Pan’s Labyrinth, Labyrinth-Labyrinth, Dark Tower - and by all means deconstruct as much or as little as you want out of these fandoms/associated tropes, if you want to go that route). Character development - this is such a rite of passage story, one of those formative friendships that stay with a person forever. The kids learn and change so much. The best thing about YA fic for me is its focus on change, alongside everything else an individual story might be about. What’s the impact of the events of the book on these kids?

All of the above probably sounds like a request for twisted, plotty longfic, but please don’t feel obliged to go that route! Some of the stories I’ve loved most from Yuletide have been utter gems of 1k-ish words. You can do a heck of a lot with 1k, and often it’s all you need. So, just write what you want, or what works best for you.

What I would really like is a post-Willem Jude/JB fix-it fic that does not keep the ending of the original novel, but manages to treat both characters as flawed and human, and allows Jude some form of happiness. A friend of mine said once that she felt like JB escaped from a more complex novel, and it would be great to see Jude have to engage in that complexity in some way.

-Life after the task force - a fix it for her final episode that actually, properly wraps up her quest to see if it was her father and (for serious preference!) doesn't leave her dead would be awesome.

Big Wolf on Campus 
Merton Dingle, Tommy Dawkins

I've always loved this pairing. Anything involving them coming to realise that they have feelings for each other would be great. I've always liked the "after high school" stories where we can see a bit of what they've been up to since the story ended, and Tommy coming to understand how the wolf part of him will work in matters of the heart. Otherwise, pretty much anything that pairs these 2 will be fine.

Neighbors | Bad Neighbours (Movies) 
Pete Regazolli, Teddy Sanders (Neighbors)

The surprise pairing from this movie! I love these 2 guys - the smart and sort of sensitive one paired with the total jock. It's a stereotype but fun all the same. Would love to see how they get on after everything is finished, but also like stories centred on how they deal with the fallout of getting together in the environment of "frat house" politics and biases. Most stories about this pairing tend to be very inward focussed I've found - dealing with their own internal struggles, but would also like to see more about how the rest of their group respond to it.

Would also love to see a bit of an angst story, maybe set in the second movie and dealing with Pete's partner coming to realise that he's in the middle of something, maybe even before Pete and Teddy do.

Sky High (2005) 
Warren Peace, Will Stronghold

This is one of my favourite all time pairings, and I can't believe there aren't more stories out there. As with Big Wolf on Campus, almost anything with this pairing will be fine, except that I don't like the "Warren becomes a bad guy anyway" story. I don't mind other sorts of conflict or angst, but I've never liked Warren as a villain. Dealing with Layla, Will's dad, during school, after school, all those are fine.

Redwater (TV 2017) 
Andrew Kelly, Kieran Harrington

I would love something set either before the series, when Kieran and Andrew are kids fumbling through their feelings for one another, or when Andrew came to visit Kieran and Eileen in New York, or something set after the series around them trying to navigate their relationship - the last episode left things pretty open, but made it clear that these two just can't stay away from each other and their last scene almost felt like a declaration that they're not going to stay away from each other. Tell me about that, what to they do, can they figure this out? Or just give me a slice-of-life with the two of them together after the series, what are their quieter, more private moments like. Anything touching on the lingering trauma that both of them suffered from the accident and Mouse's death, Kieran's fear of water would be great as well.

Baseball RPF 
Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper

I just love the sort of mentor/student relationship these two have, how Werth looks out for Harper and is trying to teach him about the game and about playing outfield, etc, and Harper just totally looks up to Werth and almost seems like he's trying to emulate him in a lot of ways. Harper is like the over-eager puppy who gets into trouble but just really wants to please his team and play well, while Werth is the grizzled older veteran trying to keep the young upstart in check. I'd love to read something that gets into those aspects of their relationship, maybe surrounding their loss in the playoffs last year or whatever happens in the playoffs this year, or some hurt/comfort.

Give me all the Sam/Lindsay! Porny or shmoopy or bickering - they're both kind of assholes, especially in the beginning of the movie and at various times throughout, but have such clear devotion to one another that I love (I love characters who are total assholes but have that one person that they really care for and show their love and loyalty for, and that's Lindsay, in particular, to a T with Sam). Backstory on their friendship or where they go from the events of the movie with Sam now learning how to be a better person and maybe guiding Lindsay in that direction as well. Or just some sex, I'm totally down for a PWP too.

The Demon Headmaster - Gillian Cross 
Dinah Glass | Dinah Hunter

Dear Yuletide Author,

This has been one of my favourite books ever since I was a child.  I think you could write anything to do with the world and I would be happy!  But what do I particularly like about?  I think it was the idea that the Headmaster had such power, that he could make you do anything - and yet despite that you could still fight back if you were clever enough and brave enough and willing to sacrifice yourselves to save the world.  

I'd be very very happy with any obvious 'Demon Headmaster comes up with Evil Plan, SPLAT defeat him' story.  Or Dinah's backstory has always fascinated me - bounced around foster homes and children's homes, learning to hide her cleverness - what happened to her before she went to live with the Hunters?  Alternatively I will always think of Dinah as 'my age', and I'm now in my thirties, so what happened to SPLAT?  Did they grow up, marry, have jobs and kids?  What would happen if they had to overthrow the Demon Headmaster as adults in 2017 instead of as children in the 80s?  

I adore the first two books which I read when I was young, but (blush!) kind of think of the rest of the series as fanfic that just happens to be written by Gillian Cross, so don't worry at all if you just want to treat the first book as canon and then go off piste.  But I know the rest and mostly like them, and if characters from later books show up that's great too :-)  I've never seen the TV show.

No real DNWs I can think of, although for me the Headmaster is always in it for the power and for making things neat and tidy and stripping away untidy emotions - I can't imagine any story where the Headmaster used his powers for sexual control ringing true for me.

While I like dark stories about loss of control and powerlessness, I also like cracky funny things too, and have a bit of a soft spot for crossovers, if you're sitting there thinking 'what I want to write is a Harry Potter crossover where SPLAT are magic and get sorted into Hogwarts houses and the Demon Headmaster tries to hypnotise Dumbledore' that is not going to make me sad :-)

A Saturday Life - Radclyffe Hall 
Francis (A Saturday Life)

Dear Author,

So, err, this is a really rarely read book by a pretty uncommonly read author.  I'm almost tempted to skip writing these optional details, as I find it so hard to believe I've actually matched on this one!  And given how miraculous and wonderful it would be to find anyone else in the world who has read this book and likes it enough to want to write fic about it, you can write whatever you want, and it will warm my heart and make me happy.

That aside, and with the knowledge that optional details are optional, oh Frances.  Frances, Frances, Frances.  The whole book leaves me in such a twisted conundrum of liking and respect and frustration and pity and love for Frances.  In so many ways, she's the one that makes everything happen - right at the start she's the one who finds Sidonia a dancing teacher, she's the person who knows the Ferrari's and introduces Sidonia to them, she's even the person who first says to Lady Shore that Sidonia must meet boys.  But all that happens grieves her so much, yet she never gives up her loyalty and love.  'So long as you're happy', as she says to Sidonia at the end (juxtaposing against her comment to David, in response to 'are you really happy?', 'No of course now, nobody is')

I think it's the ambiguity and the way she is always betwixt and between things that intrigues me - close friends, but never fully family, mannish, yet still a woman, and always torn between Lady Shore and Sidonia.   

Err, I guess that's more of a ramble, and not much of a prompt.  Just give me anything that gives me another view into Frances.  Whether that's her and Lady Shore, older and still content together.  Or some crazy fix it fic where Sidonia comes to her senses (or at least changes her fads again) and Frances has to stand up finally to the insufferable David and help her escape.  Letters from Frances, Frances's journal, any scene from the book told from her point of view.  What was in her mind during that unbearable scene where Sidonia, so full of teenage naivity, throws herself at Frances begging her to throw off her mother, and love _her_ - 'aren't I attractive?  I don't want to marry anyone, I just want to work and have you, all of you' ?  Sidonia thinks, so casually so much later 'I would have liked to take her away from Mother - thank God I didn't success in doing that, what a mess I'd be in now!'  Is she right?  Or is there an alternative world where Frances and Sidonia run off together for Wild Adventures?  What does Frances want?  Can she ever get it, and have a small slice of the happiness she doesn't believe in?

[Oh, it's a terribly long shot, but I'm guessing someone who's bothered to read A Saturday Life has probably read other Radclyffe Hall as well, and I will admit, I would love to read the fic where Stephen Gordon, Elizabeth Rodney and Frances Reide get together over tea (or something stronger) and have a real safe space where they are all variants on God's pattern together, and can talk and be understood (and probably bitch a lot!) ]

Master Song - Leonard Cohen (Song) 
You (Master Song)

Dear Author,

This song!  With all the Complicated Feels, and the Ambiguity, and the Imagery!  

There's lots of things I could say about what I'm looking for, but I don't really know what I'm looking for other than tell me the story that you find in the song.  I worry that if I say too much about how I read what's going on, that will muddy the water, and maybe the delight of this fandom is the scope for interpretation, and going where it takes you.  If your story was sparked by the song, then that's all I was looking for.

On the other hand, if your yuletide is full of Bears, and you want some inspiration about what I see in the song and what interests me, here are some vague notes.  Read them if you want to.

- The relationship of going away (with the Master) and returning, and the bitterness of the man she's returned to (your love is dust) yet his inability to leave her (your prisoner)

- and yet it's more complicated than that.  He sent her to the Master? (And I sent you to him with my guarantee)  He loved the master too?  (I loved your master perfectly) He was certain she'd return and still love him?  ( I taught him how you would long for me no matter what he said)   Was that true?  Or was the Master's spell too strong? She has come back...

- the power dynamics, the mastery and submission (will you kneel beside this bed ... a collar of leather and nails ...  your master)

- the religious imagery.  (wine and bread... some temple... he hands you the apple core...) Maybe there is a reading where the Master isn't another man she's left him for, but a religious experience?  Or both?

- that powerful sadness, that the man thinks she loves the Master because of the differences between him and the Man, some of which are choices of the Man's own making.  (I'm sure that he told you everything I must keep locked away in my head... he never once made you explain or talk about all of the little details)

- the hint that although the Master has given her total bliss (cruised above the ribbons of rain... erased the final wisps of pain) he has also failed her somehow (your love ... never stops not even when your master fails.)

- all the glory of sex (His body is a golden string that your body is hanging from) and the shaming of sex (your thighs are a ruin, you want too much... your love is a secret all over the block)

- the song is so one sided, and the Man is so confident he knows what has happened.  But is he right?  What story do we see if we give a voice to the Woman?  Has she come back to give crumbs to a prisoner she pities, while she's still in love with the Master?  Or is it all a bit more complicated than that?

So any story about complicated relationships, about loving someone, and loving someone else, and leaving and returning - particularly that strange dynamic where actually they both love the Master, and this whole situation has happened because of something the Man did to cause it all to happen - that would work for me.   But really, just go where the song takes you, if actually you just get one scrap of lyric stuck in your head and want to spin a whole story out of that, that's totally fine by me too :-)

Hello stranger! Happy Yuletide!

Here's the quick basics:

I'm gonna be so happy with whatever you create. I know writing for a stranger can be scary and anxiety-inducing, but the fact that you're writing for one of these fandoms at all is gonna light up my day.

I ship a lot of ships. (Lately my motto’s been “ship all the ships” for most of my fandoms. I can see the potential in almost any ship.) M/M, F/F, F/M, threesomes, moresomes, gen … it’s all good to me. I'm comfortable with a lot of kinks. And I LOVE getting smut as a gift. But I am completely fine with gen if you're not comfortable writing smutty stuff! A commitment to the universe and a faithfulness to the characters is what's most important to me.

My Squicks/Stuff To Avoid: major character death, major character illness, adultery/cheating, medical play, eye torture, gaslighting, incest, fridging female characters, demonizing female characters for "getting in the way" of a m/m pairing, Rape As Drama, A/B/O verse (I’m fine with it sometimes but only in very specific ways, so probably best to just avoid it for Yuletide), brutal unhappy endings with no hope in sight (except for The Screw Job fandom.)

Stuff I Like/Stuff I Love/Stuff I’d Enjoy Seeing: cuddling, bondage, whipping, knifeplay, gunkink, threesomes, femdom, FoeYay, female-character focal fic, cisswap fic, Christmas fluff, domestic fluff/curtain fic, kink negotiation, character A teaching character B to defend themselves, bandaging someone’s wounds, polyamory, couple locked in a room, first time, aftercare, role reversal AU, characters cooking dinner for each other, longtime crushes becoming longtime relationships, platonic sleeping together, general character exploration*

* You don’t need to include any of these, I'm just listing some things I like so you get a better sense of me.

My Yuleporn letter if you are so inclined: https://yuletide.dreamwidth.org/97180.html?thread=701596#cmt701596

Please don’t worry about trying to follow any of my prompts or adhering to them. These are just some ideas to get your creativity going if you want, and a way to show you my tastes:

1) Detailed character exploration of one or some or all of the characters I requested. Their life prior to the show, during the show, after the show, whatever you like.

2) Your take on what happened after the end. Theories, possible ideas for what’s going on with that show, anything that strikes your fancy.

3) Daniel and Irene, a rare private moment of intimacy on such a crowded show.

4) Sabina and Daniel in the woods, trying to find answers.

5) Cuddlepile for warmth, anyone or everyone.

These books have long counted among my most reliable pick-me-ups.

I nominated Gerry, Larry, Leslie and Mrs Durrell. I also love Spiro, Theodore, Margo, Larry’s guests, and Gerry's tutors (tree-fighting George!). I love everyone's dynamics with everyone. I’d love a brand new episode that focuses on any/all of the nominated characters, optionally including any/all of the others I listed.

However, if you don't ship it, a crossover (see letter for options) or an adventure that adds magic or supernatural elements to the otherwise canonical universe would also be great.

There are many prompts in my letter!

Biggest and/or Most Relevant Do Not Wants: unrequested romantic pairings (I especially don’t want any mention or foreshadowing of the canon het ending); major character death; bleak endings; alternate setting AUs or fusions (ex. modern, space, Hogwarts); “it was all a dream” endings; shovel talks; dark dynamics in my pairings; Dom/sub dynamics; asexual or aromantic headcanons; UST that never gets resolved

Hajime no Ippo | Fighting Spirit 
Miyata Ichirou, Makunouchi Ippo

See my letter for likes and feels.

Prompts: Fujii calls Ippo the Miyata Ichiro Fanclub President in the paper and it becomes a thing. In the future, Ippo retires and takes over the gym to continue the coach's legacy, and Miyata pretends he's helping only out of concern for today's boxing youth. Ippo keeps coming to Umezawa for love advice. Modern AU (or just future fic) featuring texting and selfies. Pornier edition: Miyata topping from the bottom. Shower sex. Blowjobs. Lowkey competing to get the other off first. And, I mean, if life hands you a canonically huge cock, it's totally reasonable to make size kink lemonade.

ROBOT x LASERBEAM (Manga) 
Hatohara Robato, Miura Youzan

See my letter for likes and feels.

Prompts: Robo and Youzan texting (with bonus selfies?). The press likes to play up their rivalry (maybe they do an advertisement together?), much to Robo's confusion and Rion's amusement. Robo keeps coming to Tomoya (and/or Rion?) for love advice. Pornier edition: I feel like "Robo and sex" is a prompt in itself. Does he need help understanding the appeal at first? Does he get fixated on getting something absolutely right? Does he keep a running commentary? Is Youzan completely unprepared for Robo's everything? (Yes.)

うどんの国の金色毛鞠 | Udon no Kuni no Kin'iro Kemari | Poco's Udon World 
Nakajima Shinobu, Tawara Souta

See my letter for likes and feels.

Prompts: Nakajima takes care of Souta after his accident. Nakajima bonds with Poco and learns to be a good tanuki dad. Souta and Nakajima babysit Rinko's baby. They finally actually start dating, but they keep getting cockblocked by Poco, Rinko and/or the entire population of the town. For a canon divergence flavour: what if they didn't grow up as friends, but meet when grown-up Souta ends up in hospital and Nakajima is his grumpy doctor?

Aldnoah.Zero (Anime & Manga) 
Rayet Areash, Asseylum Vers Allusia, Kaizuka Inaho

I love these three in any combination. 

* Rayet and Inaho bond over their feelings for Asseylum
* Missing scenes after the attack in the shower
* Asseylum and Rayet come to a better understanding of each other, maybe with help from Inaho as mediator
* In the future/after the series ends, Rayet and Inaho become a couple and Asseylum processes her feelings
* They have a discreet arrangement or secret relationship (any pairing combo or the trio)
* Do Not Want A/B/O, Setting AU, Rape

Hajime no Ippo | Fighting Spirit 
Makunouchi Ippo, Miyata Ichirou

Basically anything about these two would be great. Gen or slash, any rating.

Some ideas:
* As pros they have sponsors and for a special promotion, they get to film some kind of commercial together
* One of them has a crush, but it is unrequited (with or without an OR IS IT?? moment)
* At Takamura's training camp, they have their first time
* One of them has a career-ending injury or Miyata starves himself too intensely trying to stay in the same weight class, they realize they will never get to have their showdown
* Fantasy AU: Miyata is a knight of lineage, Ippo is an upstart wanna-be squire, they joust
* A/B/O: Ippo's huge and smells nice and Miyata is trying to hide that he's in heat
* A/B/O: Miyata was labeled an omega, but is trans-alpha (Ippo is entirely up to you)
* Do Not Want Rape
