I would love fic that's just whatever they ride into after Exile's Gate, honestly. The next adventure in canon would work fine for me because I loved the whole inexorable grind forward, burdened by terrible purpose. I'd also take a brief moment of respite for them. Or it would be really cool to see the moment in the future where Vanye realizes that he's come to truly understand Morgaine, and the loss he feels at that, because it means he's left his people behind entirely, instead of just mostly. If you feel inclined to write either of them on their own, this is the one canon where I find myself wanting really bleak stories. I'd love fic for Morgaine set in the past of Vanye's world, when she's realized that she's finally all alone, all her comrades are dead, and she has to use what is to hand to continue their mission without any hope of true companions ever again. Or something where the worst has happened and Morgaine has fallen or been trapped behind a Gate, and Vanye is forced to continue onward alone. Or something where everything goes wrong and Morgaine has to leave him behind after all, from either of their POVs. Obviously, in the case of those prompts, you don't have to include both characters. But I  do feel like the absent one would still be a major presence, except in the case of Morgaine backstory.\n\nOne random crossover request, just on the off-chance you know both canons: the <em>qhal</em> are white-haired beings with technology so powerful humans constantly mistake them for sorcerers, who treat humans as inferiors and slaves or playthings. If you feel moved, a crossover with Utena where Akio and Anthy are Qhal and Ohtori is one of the many worlds connected by the Gates would be exactly my cup of tea.\n\nLetter: http://undomielregina.dreamwidth.org/41179.html\n\n\n"
