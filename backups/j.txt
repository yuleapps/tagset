Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Seivarden Vendaai, Lieutenant Ekalu, Lieutenant Tisarwat

I have wanted this fic for forever and I know it probably isn't popular but. Post-Mercy, set in Ro2S. Tisarwat basically just getting fucked by Seivarden and Ekalu at the same time. I don't care what genital configurations you give them so long as you keep the pronouns she/her for all of them obviously. This would be something voluntary and fun for all of them, nothing forced. I would like to see double penetration on Tisarwat, but not required if that's too much for you. I would definitely like Tisarwat pressed between them both at some point though, either while one fucks her and the other holds her or if they are just cuddling together afterwards or during foreplay. Seivarden leaning past Tisarwat to kiss Ekalu while they have sex is A++. Also anything with Tisarwat being bratty or complaining while Seivarden or Ekalu tease her is A++.

I played my second 4 Job Fiesta run this past August and somehow I was really, really charmed by Gilgamesh! He has a hell of a character arc, going from Exdeath's lackey to sacrificing himself so Bartz and co. can save the world...I'd really like to see some insight into who he is! Where did he come from, why is he working for Exdeath, how did he sort out his feelings about the heroes, what was his journey through the rift like, what's the deal with Enkidu? So many questions. Post-game fic where he finally tracks down Bartz again for those promised adventures (shippy or not!), backstory fic exploring his origins and motivations, interactions with the other denizens of the Void...really, just anything focusing on Gilgamesh is good.

Final Fantasy IV 
Scarmiglione (Final Fantasy IV), Cecil Harvey (FF IV)

This is one of those "you don't have to include both characters" requests, although a fic combining them would be really incredible! Scarmiglione is my favorite of the Fiends, and he has a lot of personality without much screentime so I'd really like to see some development of him! I love the idea of a rotting, poisonous undead as a corrupted earth monster, and there's clearly some tension between all of the Fiends and Golbez that could be explored. What tasks did Scarmiglione perform before attempting to take out Cecil? Why does he go around in disguise? Where did he come from, and does he have some connection to the undead-haunted Mt Ordeals? Gross body horror stuff is a bonus here. 

For Cecil, I'm really interested in his process of redemption, of giving up the dark sword and accepting the mantle of paladin. Obviously he committed terrible crimes at the orders of the king of Baron, but to a certain extent his status as a dark knight seems to carry some inherent moral blight. What IS a dark knight, and why is it regarded with such horror? What was it like to finally be free of it? How did Cecil come to terms with wielding such a terrible power, what awaited him if he had never given it up..and conversely, what does the mantle of paladin mean for him now? Have there been others before him, dark knight and paladin both?

DNW: Kain as a major focus

新・世界樹の迷宮 ミレニアムの少女 | Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl 
Simon Yorke (Millennium Girl), Rosa (Millennium Girl), Raquna Sheldon (Millennium Girl), Arthur Charles (Millennium Girl)

I thought Simon and Arthur's relationship was really interesting, with the potential to be sweet or dark...or both, maybe? I'm happy with shippy or platonic here as long as there's some intensity of feeling! As the only survivors of a horrific catastrophe, I'm really interested in how they both deal with that...especially since Simon remembers and Arthur doesn't, and Simon's protective caution contrasted with Arthur's rashness. I'm up for a fic set during their adventures in Etria, during- or post-disaster, or something about their time at the library (especially since Arthur would have basically grown up there). I love that Raquna comes from an upper-class background but is a rough-and-tumble, hard-drinking kind of girl, and I'm kind of curious how she ended up finding a path as an adventurer when her parents seem to be kind of overbearing. I'm also a big fan of master-servant relationships (again, shippy or not!), so I'm really curious about her relationship with Rosa. Surely working for Raquna must be pretty different from working at a noble estate...does Raquna drag her out drinking, is Rosa ever curious about their adventures, and just generally what is their relationship like beyond what we see in the game? 

I like the over-arching plot of the game, but the main attraction for me is all the dungeon-crawling details and the business of delving into the Labyrinth, so I'd really like something that uses some of those elements, even a little bit!

Zarenyia (Johannes Cabal), Miss Smith (Johannes Cabal)

When I read Fall of the House of Cabal, I shipped these two instantly. I was delighted to see Miss Smith get a bigger role, and I would LOVE to see some of her exploits post-canon. We've seen Cabal's truly scientific approach to dark sorcery, so what about hers? Surely she must have goals that drove her to the art, and that she'll want to still pursue. She seemed to get along SO well with Zarenyia as she discovered her taste for mayhem with her...so I can only imagine that when in need of hellish assistance, she might turn to the succubine. Adventures, weird magic, and all things ghoulish and grim would be awesome (I'm especially fond of Smith's companionable relationship with the ghouls)...maybe Smith has to track Zarenyia down in Hell or beyond when she fails to answer a summons, or maybe their statuses are reversed and it's the devil who needs to call upon the necromancer. I should also specify that I would LOVE something porny for this pairing, as weird as you can make it -- maybe Zarenyia lets Smith participate in one of her feeding sessions, even...

NieR: Automata (Video Game) 
2B (NieR: Automata), 9S (NieR: Automata), Eve (NieR: Automata), Adam (NieR: Automata)

This game DESTROYED ME and quite frankly I'd love anything about it! But in particular, I'm completely fascinated by the relationships in this game, and how they intertwine violence and sexuality and love in so many ways. I love how the game communicates the experience of being hacked, so I would love something that explores that process from 9S's perspective...clearly it's an intimate connection on some level, so I'm VERY curious about what it was like hacking Eve's grief-stricken mind...or if he has ever done it to 2B. I'm also super interested in some of the canon scenes where extreme violence and lust merge -- 9S's ecstatic fight with the 2B models (after which he wakes up next to a corpse in what appears to be post-coital bliss), 9S's capture and possible torture by Adam (did Eve interact with 9S at all?), and Adam's eventual death at the hands of 2B (which he embraces with obvious rapture). And, of course, the final question on my mind is...given that 9S and 2B have been playing out this cycle over and over again, has 9S ever XXXXed 2B as Adam claimed he wanted to? For whatever 4-letter verb you want to slot into that ambiguous statement.

Nier (Nier), Grimoire Weiss (Nier)

One of my favorite things about Nier is how everything is done for love; from the eradication of the human race to sacrifice of a life or an entire existence, so many great and terrible things are done out of love for each other. Grimoire Weiss is my favorite in a game of characters I love, and I adore how his relationship with Nier went from condescension and complaining to intense loyalty and love (and complaining). I'd be glad with fix-it fic, fic with the melancholy tone of canon, or just everyone bantering with one another while Nier catches a goddamn Dunkleosteus. I adore Nier/Weiss, especially Weiss rediscovering his humanity after being being alone and only a tool for so long.

Rivers of London - Ben Aaronovitch 

My only big squicks are for Zombies, bullying (even if resolved/tackled in-story), slave AUs, graphic sex/violence, and I'm strongly emetophobic. 

London has so many urban legends and myths, that just having any of the characters – main or supporting – tackle one of those would be wonderful. I've requested 'Any' because I genuinely love all the characters, so just a small 'day in the life in weird London' story would delight me. After Peter and Nightingale, my particular favourites are Sara Guleed and Abigail, but Zachary Palmer and Lady Caroline are right up there as well. 

I have a preference away from Grant/Nightingale as a pairing, and a preference towards Gen rather than a shipfic in general. All and any pairings in the background are great, I'd just rather not have something with romance in the foreground.

One of the things I love is Jessica being a competent PI, so a casefic would be awesome. Or how she came to set up Alias Investigations in the first place – Jessica vs bureaucracy as she tries to get her licence would be all kinds of awesome. I'm also a big fan of Malcolm, so would love something after the end of S1 with the two of them bouncing off each other. Something post-Defenders with Jessica dealing or not dealing (however you see it!) would be fab.

My big love in Sense8 is the FAMILY feel of it all. Something focussed on that, on how they support each other through the little things, as well as the big ones that we see on the screen, would be wonderful. Nomi helping someone set up their new smartphone, or Will giving advice on burglar-proofing a house, or Caphaeus helping someone test drive a car or choose a film to watch. I love the quiet moments, with them just being family together.

For this fandom, some kind of futurefic would be amazing – how do they grow old together? What does a mature cluster relationship look like?

My particular loves are for Lito/Hernando/Dani in their adorable little family unit, and for Sun doing just about anything. 

I love all the canon pairings, but would have a preference towards Gen rather than focussing on romance or sex.

While he wouldn't be my first choice for a focus to the story, I don't hate Danny Rand, so am happy to have him in there, and would prefer no character-bashing. I'm very happy with OT4 fic for this fandom, but am a Gen fan at heart, so prefer family vibes to shipping ones.

Trish's past as a Disney Channel-type star is also a goldmine that only gets barely touched in the show - something set when they were kids, maybe? Growing up as a teen tv star with a superpowered foster sister - holy shit, what a combination . Angst would be great - my hot spot is that "they don't care like I care (but actually, they do, and I don't see it)" trope.

The fic I've been longing for ever since reading "and I'm trying my hardest not to fall" is what happens when Dan goes to university and Lewis stays at home. Long distance relationships are hard in the best of circumstances, and given their canonical communication difficulties, the two of them <i>must</i> encounter some serious challenges. Angst, misunderstandings, badly hidden insecurities, emotional hurt/comfort...any or all of those elements would be excellent. Happy ending, please!

If that prompt doesn't work for you, I'd also really love a fic about Lewis making the decision to become a paramedic, or about Dan developing a close relationship with Lewis's mother, or about Lewis coming out to (one or more of) his friends--despite his canonical hesitancy to do so, they'll <i>have</i> to know what's up when he gets married, if not sooner. Or perhaps all of his friends knew already and just never acknowledged it before he and Dan moved in together/got engaged/got married; that would be great, too! Incidentally, I like that Lewis and Dan both enjoy running, if you wanted to include that somehow.

Kyougokudou Series - Kyougoku Natsuhiko 
Chuuzenji Akihiko, Sekiguchi Tatsumi

I find Kyougokudou (or Chuuzenji, however you'd like to refer to him) intriguing, and I appreciate the somewhat complicated dynamic between him and Sekiguchi. Anything with meaningful interaction between them would be great, honestly. Perhaps just an ordinary afternoon visit, when they're not in the midst of a case? Or maybe school-era backstory, that would be incredible. Feel free to include e.g. Enokizu and Kiba too.

You don't have to give equal focus to both of them, though! I'd love a Kyougokudou-centric piece that touches on his relationship with Sekiguchi, for instance. I'd also love something dealing with those few days that Sekiguchi spent at Kyougokudou's place at the end of Ubume no natsu, or something that takes place between Ubume no natsu and Mouryou no hako. Processing the events of Ubume no natsu can't have been easy, and a closer look at how Sekiguchi copes (with or without Kyougokudou's help) would be great.

I'm open to pairingfic about these two, but I'd prefer if it didn't go much further than UST or complicated feelings.

Philosophy RPF 
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Philosophy RPF)

I don't know who nominated Wittgenstein this year but I was excited to see him in the tagset! I'm interested in the question of what sort of person it takes to be a philosopher, and I'd be thrilled by fic which looks at language and logic and meaning, but in the context of his non-academic life.

But if that's too pretentious, I also have a great and undying weakness for fic set in Cambridge (full disclosure: I did an MPhil there and loved the university and the city). You could write fic in which Wittgenstein just wanders around the city and I would be thrilled. And then there's that fascinating dynamic between Wittgenstein and Russell...

I noticed that Kierkegaard is also in the tagset -- if you would like to write about Wittgenstein's fascination with Kierkegaard, please do!!

Un-Go 
Kaishou Rinroku

I find Kaishou Rinroku fascinating, and I'd love almost anything featuring him. A deeper insight into his motives and personal convictions, more backstory, a pointed exchange with Shinjuurou, a look at what sort of father he is/was to Rie -- whatever. But I'd really prefer no pairings. (Exceptions: unromantic UST with Shinjuurou, or anything about his relationship with his late wife, because seriously, what sort of husband would Rinroku be?? Rinroku's thoughts on Izumi's obvious loyalty/affection for him are fine, too, but no reciprocation on his part, please.)

Kimi to Boku | You and I 

I have a deep fondness for this gentle yet hilarious series, and all of its characters; this probably isn't very helpful, but I'd be thrilled with all manner of fic for it. A light-hearted ensemble fic that reads just like a chapter of the manga. Any sort of AU (taking off from one of Matsushita's scenarios??), whether played serious or otherwise. A character study of the twins (individually or together or both, or looking at how they've been navigating relationships with other people), or of Shun (his later chapters in the manga really struck me), or of Kaname (and his worries about the future?). Something poignant and/or bittersweet about their last days of high school and all the changes about to come. Future fic and how friendships survive/change/don't change with age and the demands of adult life.

I chose "Any" here deliberately and I'd be happy with fic about all or any of the characters in the tagset -- please feel free to include others, too!

Battle: Los Angeles (2011) 
Elena Santos (Battle: Los Angeles), Lee Imlay (Battle: Los Angeles), Michael Nantz (Battle: Los Angeles)

I'm a big fan of apocalypse or alien invasion stories where a small band of heroes saves the day or turns the tide, and this one delivers in spades. It has the Iron Woobie/Sergeant Rock character (a favorite trope of mine) in Michael Nantz; the tough girl who carries her own weight and is essential to saving the day in Santos; a tight POV on the heroes; even the mauve shirts we lose before the movie's half over get at least a thumbnail's worth of characterization and snappy dialogue; it's about as realistic as you get in one of these types of stories; and the whole 'retreat hell' throughline gets me every time. When they're all in that tent at the end crashing from taking down the alien command and control and getting somewhere safe, and Nantz looks around at their expressions and decides nah, ammo up everyone, we're going back in! and they all immediately perk up, that whole forged-in-fire teaminess of it, yeah.

So, tell me another story with that team!  Some prompts at my letter.

Independence Day (Movies) 
David Levinson, Constance Spano, Tom Whitmore

As I said with Battle: Los Angeles - I'm a big fan of apocalypse or alien invasion movies where a small band of heroes saves the day or turns the tide, and the original Independence Day is one of the reasons for that preference! I didn't like some of the character choices in the second one, but I did love the further glimpse into that world, the continuation of the fun character interactions + the earnest cheesiness of it all + geeks triumphant, even if the science is dodgy + the whole air of "we can rebuild it better, we have the technology!" of the sequel. Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson is my fave, but I loved him with Constance, and I quite liked President Whitmore and his interactions with them both as well.

So, give me more of those three! [I haven't read the tie-in books, and would strongly prefer you not invoke Constance's fate as revealed in them, but you can use any other book-canon details or not as you please.]  Some prompts at my letter.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Jack's Eye (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Wet Stick | Tristan (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

This one breaks my invasion/apocalypse theme, but don't mistake it for being a tacked-on request - this was my favorite new movie of the year. I've always had a love-hate relationship with the King Arthur mythology; the setting, the heroic plots, the band-of-brothers feel of the Round Table, the lords-and-ladies romantics, and in general the whole epic fantasy feel of it all are very much my jam, but the tragic-ending and betrayal and non-consensual incest parts of it not so much! Which is why I so enjoyed this take on it: it put the magic back into King Arthur after the 2004 movie took it out, and remixed it in fresh ways without hanging Epic Doom over Arthur's head.

All the clever/quippy character interactions, the mix and match with elements from the greater legendarium, the hero's journey arc, the twists on expectations (such as Kay being one of the brothel ladies, and Arthur giving no fucks about chivalry, etc.), the excellent soundtrack, the excellent scenery (human and otherwise) - it was all pretty much MADE FOR ME. I even enjoyed Vortigern's scenery-chewing villainy and fucked up relationships with everyone (I just prefer no Arthur/Vortigern for this exchange).

This fandom, I'd take any two or three characters I prompted, as it might be hard to include all four. I tried to cover a range of options in the prompts at my letter.  :)

Sharknado (Movies) 
Finley "Fin" Shepard, April Wexler, Gil Shepard II, Nova Clarke

Speaking of apocalypse or alien invasion movies where a small band of heroes saves the day or turns the tide... these movies are utter crack, the characters are all pretty wooden, and the plots don't even pretend to make scientific sense, but I watched them all for the cameos and the hilarity and the continual one-upping of the wacky and was not in the least disappointed. Give me anything in the spirit of the series, and I will be thrilled; give me a story that also actually makes sense, and I will be absolutely delighted.

I chose Fin's son Gil as a character in the hopes that if you offered him, you've seen all five movies, too; because the end of that fifth movie is just BEGGING for time travel shenanigans (or crossovers, if you like them too - virtually anything on my AO3 page is fair game).

If that thought doesn't thrill you, though, you don't have to include young Gil; there are other prompt possibilities at my letter.

My favorite characters are Zoidberg, Hermes and Leela, but you’re welcome to write anything as long as it’s not Fry/other or Leela/other. My favorite Futurama episode ever is ‘The Devil’s Hands Are Idle Playthings’ so you could play off that episode if you like!

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Commander Woodsinger (In Other Lands), Louise Sunborn (In Other Lands), Rachel Sunborn (In Other Lands)

My letter has more details, explanations, and what I love about this book, but here's the quick summary:

<b>Wants:</b> 
Worldbuilding, geekery, competent people being competent, people being good to each other, complicated choices. 

<b>Do not wants:</b> 
Sex, violence, etc. that is more graphic than the canon. Non-canon relationships, AUs, and crossovers all usually take more set-up for me than it's fair to ask for in a Yuletide request, so please also avoid. (If you have an idea that won't let you go, please check via the mods). 

<b>DNW specific to this request:</b> 
I worked in a high school for a decade: narratives that rely on all teachers being stupid, entirely inobservant, nasty are not good things for me. (Some being so is fine, as long as they're mixed with teachers who are competent, thoughtful, paying attention to their students, etc.) 

<b>Ideas:</b>
It's fine with me if you pick one of these characters to focus on, any of the three is great! 

I’m fascinated by Commander Woodsinger’s backstory. We see hints of it all through the book, but never in a lot of detail (which is appropriate, really, given that we see it from Elliot’s POV). Having worked in a high school in the past, I find the way she treats Elliot fascinating - the mix of ‘I know what you’re doing, this isn’t new’ and yet recognising that he’s not like most people there and trying to figure out what does work for him (and for the people around him) is pretty compelling to me. 

Likewise, Luke’s family, especially his mother and sister, are fascinating. I love how Rachel takes Elliot in, without smothering, but just being honestly pleased (well, most of the time). And Louise’s more free-wheeling action adventures are just fun, even when they’re also amazingly dangerous. 

I’d love to see more of the family dynamics with Rachel, Louise, or both, either during the time frame of the book, or before or after. If you want a plot to hang that on, I am totally up for more adventures where people meet mythical beings, of whatever kind. (Dragons? A sphinx? More about the dwarves?)

<b>Do not wants:</b>
Sex, violence, etc. that is more graphic than the canon. Non-canon relationships, AUs, and crossovers all usually take more set-up for me than it's fair to ask for in a Yuletide request, so please also avoid. (If you have an idea that won't let you go, please check via the mods). For this canon, please also avoid magical cure stories. (More details in my letter of what I mean about that.) 

<b>Ideas:</b>
Here, I’m more interested in a what happens next, especially with the two of them settling into a long-term relationship, magical exploration (somewhat more sensibly than Jason’s earlier efforts). Does Rose spend some time on academic study in other areas? If so, what? What does Jason do with himself when he’s less obsessed with a quick fix? How do they deal with the tension of Jason's limits on where he can go (looking as he does) and his potential desire to give Rose experiences she hasn't been able to have (music, theatre, travel?)

It's fine if the fic focuses more on one character than the other, but I'd like them to keep their happy-ever-after.

<b>Ideas:</b>
I like so many of the possibilities here, and it’s a rich fandom for all sorts of reasons. For Yuletide, I’d particularly love to see a bit more of the medical investigation side of things as a window of seeing more of some characters (the glimpses we get of Jennifer Vaughan’s approach are so tantalising - and are members of her family fairies?) so I picked Drs Vaughan and Walid here. 

Have they discovered a body of some odd being they’re trying to identify? Do they get brought in to a case that isn’t the Folly’s, but looks like it should be? Does someone try to get them to do something perfectly ordinary, but it goes sideways because they’ve become used to different standard assumptions? Backstory for Jennifer Vaughan would also be grand. 

(Feel free to include other characters as makes sense. More in the letter. I'd prefer to avoid a plot that focuses on Lesley's treachery, though it being in the background is fine. It's fine if you focus more on one of them than the other, though I requested them both because I'm interested in how they interact)

Markham intrigues me as a character as he is so influential on the story without appearing in person, although we see so many views of him and his relationship with Brandon through the eyes of many other characters.   

Some prompts if you would like:
AU where Markham and Brandon meet again - either with Brandon running away earlier or Markham still being alive. How would it be for them to meet again? Would it be as smooth as they seemed to expect to pick everything up? How would Brandon integrate into the Rifer crew (especially when they might resent that they've been there longer and suddenly pushed further out)

The Deed of Paksenarrion - Elizabeth Moon 
Gwenno Marrakai, Juris Marrakai

I love these books - and have been enjoying reading the new series as they came out. The Marrakai family in general are some of my favourite characters - I love their loyalty and care for each other - and their mischief - their gift with horses.

I love the way we see these two growing up over the books. Really any story about either or both of these characters would be wonderful. (To be clear, I am totally fine with a story about only one of my selected characters)

Some prompts if you want them:
Does Gwenno end up in knights training, and does it live up to her expectations?
What were they like growing up (mischief, alliance against the others, or rivals)?
Juris seem to be very responsible (as does Gwenno) and their interactions with younger children shows their care and protectiveness. It would be really interesting to see them interacting - either as children, or older, for example, Gwenno returning from Dorrin's service - do the two of them talk about their experiences? Is it hard for them to realise understand the ways in which the other has changed?

I'd like a story in the canon setting - AUs that see if events in canon change are great, but please no AUs that totally change the setting.

I'm fascinated by the views of Nemolis we see in the book through Idra's eyes, and think it would be very interesting to see him interacting with Maia and/or Idra. 

Some prompts if you want them:
AU - Ways Maia and Nemolis could have met? Varenechibel IV died earlier and Nemolis inherited? Nemolis wasn't on the airship? Writing letters in secret?
Idra and Nemolis's discussion of politics, family and their future.
Idra growing up and finding a place for himself.
AU - Idra is older (of age) when everyone dies - how would he have handled it? Could it work with him and Maia as more equal allies, and what would the impacts of this have been?

I have a preference for the Van Helsing romance, (and the wonderfully complex relationship he and Delacroix are trying to build), but that is just that, a preference, not a requirement. (I like all the romances, tho obviously Lupin's is the most satisfying since it addresses everyone else's plots as well as his own.) 

I would also adore gen-fic of pretty much anyone in the cast, further adventures, ways to tie up loose ends, a story on the ways all of them learned to live and work together... that's why I only picked Cardia for a required character.  While I would /like/ as much of the primary cast as possible show up in some way, it's not required.

I love Robin McKinley to pieces, but a lot of her books don't so much reach a satisfying ending as just... sort-of stop. It usually works! But I would really really love a bit more resolution/continuation for Sunshine.

Books of the Raksura - Martha Wells 
Moon (Books of the Raksura), Jade (Books of the Raksura)

I love the Raksura. I love them, I love their social structure, I love Moon's exasperation with them and theirs with him, I love the Three Worlds, I just. &lt;3

That said, I am really fond of the contrast between Moon and Ember and Stone, so anything with the three of them being mutually confounded is awesome. I love Chime and Moon's relationship, I adore Balm and Jade's relationship, and any combination of the four of them being prickly to supportive to affectionate. 

(I LOVE THE BABIES TOO. And there aren't a lot of series that I can say that about.)  I would generally prefer a piece that, like the books, is relatively slowly drawn out in regards to plot and focuses more on the relationships.

Cruel Intentions (1999) 
Kathryn Merteuil, Blaine Tuttle, Annette Hargrove, Greg McConnell

No deathfic. Characters who are canonically dead may be mentioned as so (eg, Sebastian Valmont), but no death or terminal diseases or death-causing injuries for any requested characters please.

No non-con.

I'm up for anything with this fandom. Something set during canon? Great! Something post-canon? Also good.

A few prompt ideas:

Post-canon, they all meet again. Is Kathryn rehabilitated? Are Greg and Blaine out of the closet? Has Annette married?

I ship both pairs (Blaine/Greg and Annette/Kathryn) so anything with either or both ships would be lovely.

I'm also into incompatible orientations not preventing marriage - would be open to that with any combination. Or even two respectably heterosexual couples who are secretly fucking each other's same-sex brains out.

I'd be interested in more about Kathryn post-canon, or Annette mourning Sebastian.

Or development for Blaine and Greg - does Greg come out of the closet? Does Blaine become less self-serving?

No unrequested ships, please. Mentions of past Annette/Sebastian or even Sebastian/Kathryn are fine.

I'm not opposed to only two or three characters in my story if you don't have an idea for the fourth.

The Catch (TV) 
Rhys Griffiths, Benjamin Jones, Margot Bishop, Alice Vaughan

No deathfic. Characters who are canonically dead may be mentioned as so, but no death or terminal diseases or death-causing injuries for any requested characters please.

No non-con (dub-con, such as sex by deception, is fine, and likely to happen in this universe).

I really like this show. I'd honestly be happy with any kind of story featuring these four in some capacity. But I'm open to other ideas!

Backstory about the Kensington Firm with Rhys, Benjamin and Margot? I'd love it! Backstory with how Benjamin conned Alice? Also love it!

Some kind of poly arrangement, with or without incest between Rhys and Margot? Yes, please. Especially if Margot perhaps shows Alice how good another woman can make her feel.

Separate shipping? Also good. I love Benjamin/Alice, am open to threesomes with either of the others, or Benjamin/Rhys or Benjamin/Margot - you pretty much can't go wrong with any ship here for me at all. Even out-there ideas like Rhys/Alice would be interesting to see explored.

Something gen, like Alice helping (inadvertently or not) with a con? Would be great! Or how they all actually deal with each other. I'm really very, very open to fic here.

No unrequested ships, please.

No Man's Land - Tanya Tucker (Song) 
Molly Marlowe

No deathfic. Characters who are canonically dead (eg, Barney Dawson - I might be very interested in mentions of his death) may be mentioned as so, but no death or terminal diseases or death-causing injuries for any requested characters please.

No mention of rape that didn't occur in the canon, unless it's that Molly wasn't the only girl Barney Dawson raped - that may be why he's in prison.

I heard this song again after a while of not having heard it. I thought it would be very interesting to read something based on it.

I'm interested in how Molly dealt with life after Barney's assault. How she recovered and maybe why she chose nursing. How she related to people after.

I'm not interested in her ever getting involved with a man. She could live a good and happy celibate life if she decides that sex isn't worth it after how Barney treated her.

However, I do think it's possible she could become involved with a woman. An OFC, as there weren't really any other characters in the song. A fellow nurse. A lifelong friend. A new person who moved to Brush Creek, Georgia.

I do not want her becoming a lesbian/involved with a woman (however she identifies in the story) due to the rape - it may be why she can't bear a man to touch her, but a woman is different.

But honestly, this is a fandom where anything would be interesting to read. I'd love to see your take on it!

I do ship them, so slash is fine, and I'm not picky about positions or anything of that nature. I like their relationship in canon, and would like it to be similar even in bed.

No non-con.

I'm interested in all kinds of fic with these three. I do prefer RL/canonish sort of fic, though I'm willing to handwave marriages and children if you prefer that.

I'd love something where maybe David and Christopher hooked up while making Jude, then met a few years later on Who or in relation to it. Maybe Billie even brings them back together?

Or either guy, individually, with Billie is something I ship, with an appearance from the other.

Something (gen or shippy) where they both take Billie out to comfort her after her divorce?

Just spending a night together out of time?

I'm up for anything, honestly!

I'd also be up for individual ships of any combination if the threesome doesn't inspire you.

I do ship it, so anything shippy would be wonderful. Whether it's sneaking around, or loving from afar while both are involved, or something where they get together, either back in the day or recently, on a permanent basis.

Gen fic would be lovely as well - I friendship them as much as I ship them romantically. I don't mind if there are small mentions of RL ships in a gen story with the friendship as the focus.

Oniisama E 
Asaka Rei, Henmi Takehiko, Misonoo Nanako

I am all about the tormented melodrama with streaks of hope of this series. The complex relationships, the awful manipulations, the terrible classism, and all the intense homoerotic longings. I love all the characters nominated as well as Mariko, Tomoko, and the Ichinomiya siblings. However, you don’t have to include all the nominated characters in your story. Focusing on one of them or one of them with other members of the extended cast is more than okay.

I'd love to see some missing scenes, what-if scenario AUs, or post-canon fic. Pre-canon isn't especially interesting to me as all the big stuff we saw in flashbacks, but if you've got a pre-canon story you're burning to tell by all means go ahead. This is one canon where I'm totally okay with dark themes if you want to go there because of the source material, but please keep it canon-typical (ex. dub-con situations, suicide ideation, etc are fine but onscreen non-con, onscreen suicide are not). Personally I like the show's mix of light and dark, hope and despair, but you can go lighter or darker as you choose

Danny Butterman, Nicholas Angel

This is one of my favorite films of all time so I’m keen on anything for these characters. I love the small town charm/creepiness. I love the characters, but most especially overachiever Nicholas and genial Danny. I ship them hard though if you want to keep them as platonic friends for your fic I’m happy but please don’t pair them with anyone else. You could do missing scenes, canon divergence, future fic, or go AU - I’m not really interested in pre-movie set stories. The whole cast makes me laugh so you can add as much or as little of the supporting cast as you like. It’s been ten years since the film, where would the characters be ten years from them? What obscure local traditions or holidays does Sanford observe that bewilder Nicholas? What about an historical AU set in an earlier era of British history (ex. the police as Regency era parish constables and magistrates)? No AUs that take them out of the British setting, please, I’m quite attached to the cultural influences at play.

Oz - L. Frank Baum 
Button-Bright (Oz - Baum), Dorothy Gale (Oz - Baum), Glinda the Good (Oz - Baum), Princess Ozma (Oz - Baum)

I adore the world of Oz and especially Baum's core series of fourteen books even if the continuity is wibbly-wobbly at best concerning lore/worldbuilding. I love the magic, the whimsy, the weird dark undercurrents, the sense of adventure, and the big found-family and friendships that come out the adventures. I love that Baum's Oz was heavily influenced by his wife Maud's progressive suffragist family.

Feel free to set your story pre-series, post-series, during series (I'm only counting Baum's 14 Oz novels as canon here, please no focus on characters/scenarios from non-Baum authored Oz works). I love missing scenes, alternate POVs, what-if scenarios, future fic. I love character studies just as much as world building or adventures. Feel free to pick and choose what elements you enjoy from Baum's worldbuilding or even reconcile his many retcons if it pleases you. You could also send the characters out into one of the other magical lands in the stories (Ev, Ix, the Vegetable Kingdom, etc) or have them back in the United States using magic and getting into high jinks.

Moby Dick - Herman Melville 
Ishmael (Moby Dick), Queequeg (Moby Dick)

The first eleven chapters of this novel is a love story between Ishmael and Queequeg. Seriously, if you haven’t read it in a while go back and enjoy how actual queer author Melville details about how married they are and going out of their way to share a bed even in situations where it’s unnecessary and suspicious. So that, more of that please. I love how they forged a deep connection despite being hampered by culture and language barriers. You could do missing scenes of Ishmael and Queequeg continuing their matelotage aboard the Pequod or fix-it where Queequeg also survives the shipwreck or go canon divergence where they found another ship to join instead of the Pequod.

However, if you are not down with Ishmael and Queequeg as a couple I would love to see their friendship and their interactions with other sailors aboard the Pequod. Chapter 40 is devoted to showcasing that there are sailors of every ethnicity and nationality aboard, what kind of traditions or superstitions would they be bringing from their home cultures? Ishmael is canonically a school teacher between his sailing contracts (merchant and whaling), what might he have taught his students? I love that all the harpooneers are men of color (Tashtego, Daggoo, Fedallah), but much like Queequeg they fall prey to stereotypes at times in the book. Melville did have sailing experience with men of all backgrounds, but was limited by his cultural bias. Feel free to have Queequeg or the other harpooneers act/speak more appropriate to their respective cultural backgrounds than the broad caricatures we got in the book.

Tokyo Babylon 
Sakurazuka Seishirou (Tokyo Babylon), Sumeragi Hokuto (Tokyo Babylon), Sumeragi Subaru (Tokyo Babylon)

Tokyo Babylon is ambitious and flawed, but it’s a fascinating look at Bubble Economy era Japan through the eyes of manga writers who were pretty young themselves. I really love the main cast and I was extremely disappointed that while alternate Seishirou and Subaru showed up in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles and its spin-offs, Hokuto never does. I would love to see anything with a lot of Hokuto in it, either sibling hijinks with Subaru or her going off to solve ‘cases’ in Tokyo on her own. Feel free to change the ending of the story, what if Subaru was the one who paid the price of the Bet and it was Hokuto who ended up as the lone twin? What if both twins survived, what would they do next? 

I’m also okay with whatever you want to do with Seishirou, either make him as creepy and maladaptive as the series or go full AU where he is just a vet helping out occultist teens. If you’re going to do AUs beyond canon divergent AUs, I just ask that you keep the setting in Japan (either Tokyo or Kyoto) as most of the commentary and issues surrounding the characters is about Japanese society. That said you could go actor AU (Subaru and Hokuto as former child stars), werewolf/vampire AU (because Hokuto would rock either aesthetic), historical AU (Meiji or Taisho era are great for showing modernity/tradition conflicts), or magical girl AU (Hokuto with all the powers and fighting evil by moonlight?). I’m not interested in X/1999 era/setting fic unless the focus is strongly on Hokuto and not so much on the other ‘dragons.’ However future fic with middle-aged Sumeragi twins would be more than loved.

Anne with an E (TV) 
Anne Shirley (Anne with an E), Diana Barry (Anne with an E)

I’ve loved the Anne books for years and I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this adaptation. As heartwarming as the first two Sullivan adaptations and Avonlea series were sometimes you just want non-sentimental historical fiction and Anne with an E delivers. I thought Anne’s coping with PTSD was handled in a way that made sense for her background and opened up more layers to the character. Anything with Anne and her relationships would be golden, her trying to become family with the Cuthberts, her shaky friendship with Jerry, her devotion to Diana, her kinship with Josephine, or her reaching out to Gilbert. I’m more into the Anne/Diana ship and not super big on the Anne/Gilbert, but I’m very happy with gen here, too. If you’re doing future fic feel free to incorporate or leave out material/plot points from later book events or pull other Montgomery books (this adaptation draws from the Emily books and some short stories so you could do the same if you like). This adaptation gets a bit heavy handed with the trauma at points and while I don’t mind angst in a story I do prefer stories to end on a hopeful or at least bittersweet note rather than endless despair.

Ah, Bertie and Jeeves.  My dependably sweet slice of heaven in an increasingly hellish world.  I ship Bertie and Jeeves terribly hard, but never fear if that's not for you, because I am also extremely devoted to the warm and genuine friendship that develops between them.  They love each other so, so much, and it's darling to read about.  I don't have strong preferences on any of the supporting cast of characters (although I'm not wild about that bonecrusher Aunt A.), but I do kind of prefer the British settings to the NY action.

Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (2008) 
Guinevere Pettigrew, Joe Blomfield

This Movie and My Heart: A Love Story.

I fell in love with this film the first time I saw the trailer. I saw it as soon as it opened. I bought it as soon as I could. I know it by heart. But I want to know more. Guinevere is such a mysterious ball of awesomeness. Reserved and wise, but so sneakily mischievous and wily and sly when needed, and so adorable where Joe is concerned. How is she able to be so eternally self-possessed and divine? Joe and gentlemen's socks? What was that boyhood about? If you're interested or so inclined, a little dip into their separate WWI experiences might be called for. I only requested Guinevere and Joe, but if Michael and Delysia showed up as well I wouldn't mind. Anybody, really. Even Nick, maybe, if it involved some come-uppance or redemption.

These are my dealbreakers: rape (I personally include the terms "non-con" and "dub-con" here), incest, mpreg, torture, gender swaps, slavefic, and bodily fluid/waste kinks.

If you want more details, check the letter link.  Fingers crossed that it will be full of content by the time you see this.  Yuletide kind of snuck up on me this year, but I'll try my very best to get it populated within the week.  Cheers, mystery writer!

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye

Welp, I'm only nominating Eleanor and Chidi, even though I am a complete and total sucker for ensemble fic full of the wacky hijinks and absurd scenarios that this show is practically built to provide.  So that should tell you two things: 1) you're free to throw in any of the gang or any or the Bad Place regulars that you want, and 2) I ship these two like burning. I didn't see it coming for me, but it's here, and it's insistent.

I love that they keep finding each other, and that despite Michael's best efforts, they might actually be a meditation on soulmates.  There's no real reason why Janet should always bring them together, and yet, we see it happen 800 times.  You don't have to focus on shipping them, but I'd like their relationship to form at least some part of the story.

These are my dealbreakers: rape (I personally include the terms "non-con" and "dub-con" here), incest, mpreg, torture, gender swaps, slavefic, and stuff involving bodily fluids/wastes.

Wheel of Time - Robert Jordan 
Moiraine Damodred, Lan Mandragoran

Anything but Rand, or at least minimal him, because... well, he's a woolhead. :P And I prefer poly-friendly but it doesn't have to be! Doesn't even have to be anything shippy, either, but that's always nice. Something to do with Aes Sedai is great, but again I'm not picky...

I just like WoT. :)

You can include any additional characters, including those not on the list.


Request 2 by Juulna
Stormlight Archive - Brandon Sanderson 
Shallan Davar, Kaladin (Stormlight Archive)

Any setting or time, and you can include one or both characters, but I do prefer both if you can manage it.
