Philadelphia Story (1940) 
C.K. Dexter Haven, Macaulay Connor, Tracy Lord

I finally managed to remember to put in my fandom requests, so I can finally ask for the Philadelphia Story again, after it not being in the tagsets for some time!  It is one of my favourite movies - I love Jimmy Stewart particularly and it is such a witty script.  I am a slash fan so in an ideal world I would like some CK Dexter Haven/Macauley Connor, but to be honest, I do feel Tracey is who they revolve around so a lovely threesome relationship fic would fit brilliantly in my personal head-canon.  In particular, I think that Dex and Tracey will only repeat past mistakes unless there is something different in the mix - and that is probably Mac!  However, I do like angst as well as happy fic, so you could go down a messier path with these three if you would prefer.

Killjoys (TV) 
Johnny Jaqobis, Alvis Akari

Ah, Killjoys, you spiritual successor to Firefly, you.  I am very fond of this show, I like it's world-building and the team and the arc-plot, it's fascinating.  My favourite characters are Johnny Jaqobis and Alvis Akari, so something to do with them would be great.  I am a slash fan but you don't have to necessarily pair them up, or even write for them both - you could write for one or the other, if you're only inspired by one.  I am fascinated by Alvis, so a character study exploring his beliefs, his despairs, his triumphs would be wonderful.  Johnny I want to pat on the head and hug a lot - something lovely for Johnny would be great.  I do like angst, but with Johnny I only want angst if there's a happyish ending.

Upstart Crow (TV) 
William Shakespeare (Upstart Crow), Robert Greene (Upstart Crow), Christopher Marlowe (Upstart Crow)

Upstart Crow is a show I love because it's like a kinder, slightly less witty version of Blackadder, while starring David Mitchell who I adore and see live whenever I can.  I actually saw an episode of the first series being filmed and Ben Elton came out to ask the audience questions and to explain his writing choices and... well, it was a fascinating experience.  I would love some banter and adventure between Kit and Will, together with some vitriol from Greene.  If you want to put a slashy vibe in I would not object, I see fun times for Will/Kit or hate sex for Will/Greene.  If Kit's spying is touched on, that would be fun.  I do also adore Kate and Anne, so would not object to their added presence if you fancied it, but the boys are where I would like you to concentrate.

JLX (Comics) 
Pietro Allen (JLX)

I do not want the following:
M/M as the focus or featuring the requested characters (having M/M as a secondary or side pairing is fine)
Fic where the narrative mocks a character’s beliefs
Rocks fall, everybody dies
Canon female characters swapped to male characters
Overly cruel and meaningless character death
Urine/feces/vomit used for kink
Fic focused on character's sexuality or gender identity
Mundane AUs
Unrequested incest

I find the whole Amalgam universe so interesting.  I love all the nominated characters, but I decided to request just Pietro for this.  I want to know more about everything, the world, about him, the JLA, the JLX, just anything.  I'd also love to see how later changes in Marvel and DC could effect the Amalgam universe if you're into comics in general.  I picked Pietro Allen because I like his character and his character design.  He only shows up in this one comic but I want to know more about him.  I'm open to seeing his friendships with any of the other characters explored.  For relationships I'd love to read Pietro/any female character.  Since Amalgam had the misfortune to exist at the time that Kara Zor-El had been retconned from existence I'd love to see an Amalgam Kara Zor-El interact with Pietro Allen (though based on the original Kara or post-Flashpoint Kara and not New Earth Kara).  I'd also love hearing any of the mentioned nonexistent comics from the notes or letters being expanded on.  I'm fine with porn, BDSM, character death, torture, and overall darkfic. Just don't give me a completely dark ending. Bittersweet is fine, but completely bad isn't. Check my letter for more.

Supergirl (New 52 Comics)

Fic where the narrative mocks a character’s beliefs
Rocks fall, everybody dies
Canon female characters swapped to male characters
Overly cruel and meaningless character death
Urine/feces/vomit used for kink
Fic focused on character's sexuality or gender identity
Mundane AUs
Unrequested incest
References to the New Earth Kara
Kara/Clark, Kara/Jimmy Olsen, Kara/Mon-El

Ah, I love Kara so much.  It was Supergirl and Power Girl that really got me into comics.  I started with Ame-Comi Girls and I moved to main DC right when the New 52 hit.  I know others might not like it, but I freaking love the New 52.  This series really seemed to be constantly knocking Kara down whenever she seemed to get a little happiness, but it ended with her being a stronger, more mature heroine.  I'm at the point where I know enough about DC to know what I want to read and find it, but I still wouldn't call myself well versed in it per say.  This is going to sound like a random detail, but I adore the way Kara's cape fastens in this costume.  I'm up for team ups with any DC or Marvel character.  I also love shipfic, both M/F and F/F, so if you want to write something involving Kara being paired with another character I'd love to read it.  I'm fine with porn, BDSM, character death, torture, and overall darkfic.  Just don't give me a completely dark ending.  Bittersweet is fine, but completely bad isn't.  Check my letter for more.

Earth 2 (Comics) 
Jay Garrick (Earth 2 Comics)

I do not want the following:
Slash featuring Jay
Fic where the narrative mocks a character’s beliefs
Rocks fall, everybody dies
Canon female characters swapped to male characters
Overly cruel and meaningless character death
Urine/feces/vomit used for kink
Fic focused on character's sexuality or gender identity
Mundane AUs
Unrequested incest

I am not anywhere near done reading Earth 2.  But I do love it and I do know some of the spoilers for what is coming up.  So I ask that you please excuse if me if some of my prompts and ideas are answered further ahead of where I'm at.  You also can go ahead and write spoilers in the fic.  I'm probably going to be much further along come December than I am currently.  I have read the Worlds' Finest series so I know what Helena and Karen were up to on the main Earth.

Since I started with the New 52, this Jay is the first Jay I've read about and actually is my first Flash overall.  I have since developed a love of the classic Jay as well and I really hope DC will let both exist as I'd hate to lose either Jay.  It was difficult to chose which character(s) to request but as Jay is one of my favorite characters overall and my favorite DC speedster, I went with him.  I also really love both Helena and Karen though and I would love it if one or both could show up in in the fic.  If you have a favorite DC or Marvel character that you'd love to see Jay team up with then go for it.  If you would like to write shipfic then Jay/any female character from Marvel or DC is fine.  I'm fine with porn, BDSM, character death, torture, and overall darkfic. Just don't give me a completely dark ending. Bittersweet is fine, but completely bad isn't. Check my letter for more.

DC Super Hero Girls (Web Series) 
Kara Zor-El (DC Super Hero Girls), Koriand'r (DC Super Hero Girls)

I do not want the following:
M/M as the focus or featuring the requested characters (having M/M as a secondary or side pairing is fine)
Fic where the narrative mocks a character’s beliefs
Rocks fall, everybody dies
Canon female characters swapped to male characters
Overly cruel and meaningless character death
Urine/feces/vomit used for kink
Fic focused on character's sexuality or gender identity
Mundane AUs
Unrequested incest

This canon is so adorable!  If you only want to write one character then it is fine to drop Koriand'r and just write about Kara.  I loved the interactions between the two in Intergalactic Games and I'd love to see more of them working together.  I love their canonical best friends status with Barbara and Victor, but I also want to see these two solar powered aliens also bond with each other.  I have a whole list of possible ships for either girl on my letter if you check that out.  While I love the show's tone I'd love to read a fic that's darker or more serious than the canon.  This could be anything from dealing with a serious threat to having to deal with the darker parts of crime.  I'm fine with porn, BDSM, character death, torture, and overall darkfic. Just don't give me a completely dark ending. Bittersweet is fine, but completely bad isn't. Check my letter for more.

Halt and Catch Fire 

Do not have to use all characters; any combination appreciated! Open to any/all shipping options, including slash/femslash (in fact, very fond of Donna/Cameron!) and polyshipping (if that's your jam!) included. Also totally open to minor characters and/or OCs/OC ships. And if you're into it, I'm very fond of AU/crossovers if you want to try it out. As for DNWs, I don't really have any hardcore DNWs, but you can check out my Yuletide letter for things I'm a little bit eh about, but still would not really mind if you felt it fit your piece!

Otherwise: As of now, S4 is not yet completely aired. If you want to wait until after the entire series is complete to write something that encompasses everything from all 4 seasons, go for it! If you want some ideas (that you do not have to use all of, or even use at all!):

- The Donna/Cameron relationship (ship or otherwise) is amazing to me in its depth and realism. The fact that this show puts women into tech history exactly as they should be is already amazing, but smashing through the Bechdel Test with glorious flying colors is one of the many things I especially love about this show.
- I continue to love the way they handle Joe's sexuality and indeed any queerness in the show. It warms my heart so much, especially considering the era. And casual bisexuality validation!!Amazing!!!!
- I'm a tech geek and while I may not understand everything that is going on in the show, I really enjoy hearing characters explain how something could/could not work and really getting into it. Since all of the main cast are super competent and passionate about their work, it basically means I'm forever crying about how awesome everyone is, and therefore how awesome everyone is when they work together on something, dysfunctionality and all.
- Speaking of dysfunctionality, one of my favorite types of relationships to explore is dysfunctional ones, especially ones handled with such complexity. There's just something about internecine relationships that are simultaneously one-of-a-kind in inspiring passion for life that really gets to me. Wow, just, people in relationships with other people whom they have a hard time getting along with, but still can't stay away from because there is no one else who can make them feel the way they do in this world. Crying forever jldkjslk

Sorry, I hope I'm not putting you off with a text wall! I just have a lot of feelings about this show and I promise I will love you just for writing for this fandom!!!

Mawaru Penguindrum 

Any combination of these nominated characters is OK! If you want to ship, I'm OK with any, including slash/femslash. AU/Crossover also OK! I don't have any hardcore DNWs, but if you'd like to see a list of things that I'm a little eh about, but still wouldn't really mind if they came up, please see my Yuletide letter!

Some ideas (that you do not have to use all of, or even use at all!):
- I've always wondered about how it must be like to be the only person in the world with the power to change fate, realize that no matter how much you try, you cannot create enough change to save the world because people will always be people and fate will forever be cruel. How you might despair when you realize that no one will ever see the same view as you. But then suddenly, you're <em>not</em> the only person anymore. Someone else exists with the power to displace fate. And that someone is still young enough to believe in fate--in fact, they are not unlike how you once were. (aka, Sanetoshi you sad, desolate Übermensch, maybe stop taking your disillusionment out on other people)
- (I've always been really really glad that Himari and Ringo get to be together in the changed world. I think that they would both recall fragmented memories of the world from before, and so draw comfort from the fact that they are not alone in sharing this understanding. <s>In fact, I 3809284% wouldn't mind Himari/Ringo</s>)
- Was only able to nominate 4 characters, so if you want to bring in other characters (i.e. Shouma, Kanba, etc.), gooooo for it!
- Would especially love fic from the aftermath of the series. There's such bittersweet hope that is hinted at, but I'd love to see more of it. I'm not usually a sap, but I am for this series where I want everyone to be redeemed in some way. EVERYONE IS CHOSEN; NO ONE GETS LEFT TO THE CHILD BROILER.

True Detective 
Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle, Martin \"Marty\" Hart

Slash OK; gen/friendship/bash brothers/idk also OK! Old man domesticity appreciated, but also some more of that Southern Gothic existential horror also appreciated! Feel free to get weird (magical realism/surrealism) or AU/crossover! True Detective S1 is already most of everything I love in a beautiful package, so I'm pretty sure anything else you want to do with it will be amazing. Feel free to check out my DYW letter for likes/dislikes/other stuff!!

True Detective came at a point in my life where I was only just starting to heal from various crises that threw my self-identity out the window. In the bleakness that pervades this show, I was so gratified to see the characters finding hope in the dark. There's such a startling amount of grim reality to these characters, but even then, flawed as they are, they find a path to walk on and just do their best. It's my favorite. Redemption is beautiful, but self-redemption (or as close to it as you can get) is even better.

If you cannot include all four, that is fine as well! I am flexible with ships if you want to include them, slash/femslash/polyshipping included! For more info on likes/dislikes, please see my DYW letter!

Ideas:
- I'd love to see the return of Strange and Norrell to England and find out what they've brought back from their adventures. Jonathan and Arabella are so painfully lovely and I would love to see them, if not together-together again, at least able to meet each other after so long.
- Uskglass is not nominated, but gawd, if you were up for including him somehow, I would love you forever. Again, optional, dear writer!
- Bring in whatever other characters you want!! Also if you wanted to bring in book canon, have at it!!!
- (Like many other people, my fave is Childermass, duh. Do with that info what you will \o/ )

Logan (2017 Movie) 

This movie left me in a funk for 24 hours after I watched it. When will the X-Men finally have a world where it doesn't suck for them to exist???

Anyway, have at it. Give me movie!verse happy moments. Snapshots of Logan and Laura being the best unexpected family to each other will probably send me into happy tears. Give me a beautiful AU where shit doesn't go down. Give me a hopeful post-movie ending for Laura and the young X-Men. i don't care, just... i need more from this movie and this movie's universe because it left me raw. 

(also i am a big fan of world-building and that Near-Future world was so cool, what aspects of it that we saw glimpses of)

天使禁猟区 | Tenshi Kinryoku | Angel Sanctuary 

Any/all nominated characters OK! Including other ships, OK! Given the canon material, blasphemy and sacrilege very much OK!!! Please see my DYW letter for likes/dislikes.

Angel Sanctuary is my sad cosmologically star-crossed ship canon. Angst is always appreciated, so whatever you want to do with it will be perfect. Also, if you wanted to go AU or reincarnation or something, would love to see what you do with it! This series always felt to me like such a caged inevitability, where they're all stuck in this world that they can't really help and all they can really do is struggle against their fates as best they can. It's so sad.

Obviously I ship Alexiel/Lucifer and therefore Setsuna/Kira Sakuya, but if you don't want to go shippy (or just ship one and not really the other, given that Setsuna/Sara exists), don't worry about it!

In a post-canon world, I wonder how things would go. Will Alexiel and Lucifer meet again? Kira Sakuya doesn't exist anymore, but there's evidence that his memories are retained in Lucifer's mind. And now that the truth of their world has been discovered, what kind of resolution do the characters find with this?

I love this movie so. much.  It's not amazing or anything, but it speaks to me.  Something about the out-of-timeness and letters and romance pushes a lot of my buttons, apparently.  I think I'd like to see more from that portion of their relationship -- after they figure out they're separated by time but before they meet -- but I'm amenable to a future or unrelated story.  Maybe an AU where they are still separated, but for an entirely different reason (a \"You've Got Mail\" au? dunno)?  Almost anything would be fantastic.

Lucifer (Comic) 
Lucifer Morningstar (Lucifer Comic), Christopher Rudd (Lucifer Comic)

I have wanted character fic of these two for YEARS. They have such an interesting dynamic and they offer each other really different perspectives, there's a weird friendship/allyship between them that's both practical and principled in a weird way. I'd love slash but mostly I just want SOME kind of AU that lets them spend more time together and develop that unique relationship MORE. 

I am reading the new Holly Black run and enjoying it so far, so you can include elements from that series if you want to/insert Rudd into that time, but you totally don't have to. Please no Mazikeen bashing/erasure - she doesn't have to be a major presence, but I love her too.

Lesbian Stereotypes Alignment Chart 
Lawfully Femme (LSAC), Chaotic Butch (LSAC)

If your matched fandom isn't working, you can get up to speed with this one in about 5 minutes. The \"canon\" in its entirety is this tumblr post: http://bedupolker.tumblr.com/post/145815892329/look-ma-i-made-a-tag-yourselfalignment-chart

I’d really love a Lawful Femme/Chaotic Butch fic, because, omg, so cute??? It definitely doesn’t have to be kinky smut – I’d enjoy light D/s if you went there, but I’d rather have a romance story than a PWP. Just…a sweet story about girls falling in love and CB learning to open up to her ~feelings~. Maybe a holiday story? Also, I love all the other stereotype alignment girls, so if you felt like an ensemble story about their Wacky Friend Group ™, that would be great too. A nemesis/rivalryhood between any combination of LB/LF/CF would be amazing? I’m just tossing out ideas. I’ve loved this chart for years and it would be awesome to get fic of it.

Punisher (Comics) 
George Washington \"G. W.\" Bridge (Punisher Comics), Frank Castle (Punisher Comics)

What I'd really love for this is a very classic, standard \"Frenemies Slash Fic\" type story for Frank and Bridge. It doesn't actually have to be romantic/sexual (though that would be fun!), so long as it has the *form* of old-school slash. Namely: Some Plot Contrivance happens to force Frank and Bridge to work together/be on the same side for awhile, sidestepping the normal canon rails of their criminal/law enforcement roles, and letting them understand and appreciate each other better outside that dynamic. Canadian shack! Desert island! On the run due to a frame-up! Under a weird spell that won't let them be apart! Tossed into an alternate universe together! Body-swap! Groundhog Day/Day After Tomorrow! Captured Frank drafted to help with an undercover operation! 

It's marvel, anything could happen, pick your favorite wacky trope. I love their weird parallels and the respect between them and the convictions they both have, and I'd love to see them get to engage on that level. Please no character death/super tragic ending, but if they go back to the cat-and-mouse status quo at the end, that's fine. 

(Alternately: they fuck while Frank is handcuffed in that prison van during the Jigsaw arc. I'd go for that. Top!Bridge, pretty please? IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH SMUT IGNORE THIS, THAT'S FINE.)

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Chidi Anagonye, Tahani Al-Jamil, Janet (The Good Place)

Anything that captures the punny, zany \"holy shirt!\" moments of this show would be great, but I am especially interested in the reboot where Tahani was Eleanor's soulmate and how that played out, and also anything where Eleanor and Chidi figure out they have feelings for each other. (If they manage a poly, three-way relationship, I'm interested in that, too!)

If you're feeling super adventurous and don't mind being jossed, I wouldn't mind a story about how they proceed going forward now that Eleanor has Mindy's sex tape, or an AU where instead of calling Michael out and possibly teaming up with him, they instead play along once they know it's the Bad Place, and how they get Tahani and Jason on board with that. How much does Janet know and what does she do with that knowledge? My absolute DNWs are graphic sexual violence, a/b/o, mpreg, partner betrayal, and super grim dark endings.

Gotham Academy (Comics) 
Pomeline Fritch (Gotham Academy), Olive Silverlock (Gotham Academy), Mia \"Maps\" Mizoguchi (Gotham Academy), Damian Wayne (Gotham Academy)

I am so here for supernatural schoolgirl detectives. Or maybe it's not supernatural, just some sleazy real estate developer who needs to be unmasked by some meddling kids. That is definitely always a possibility in Gotham. Whichever direction you choose, I would really enjoy casefic in the vein of canon, with Maps charging in, Pomeline insisting it's something occult, and Olive just trying to keep everyone from getting into trouble. I'm also here for the weird school shenanigans they get into. Maybe zombies crash the winter formal! Or Deathstroke attacks a swim meet! Damian and Maps have fencing together after school and fight him off with epees! Killer Croc needs their help! Poison Ivy is the new Earth Science teacher! I mean, I think a thousand words of Maps in the Batcave would be amazing, so I'm not all that fussy about plot here, you know? My absolute DNWs are graphic sexual violence, a/b/o, child harm (beyond the normal bumps and bruises one might acquire as a teenage detective in Gotham) and super grim dark endings.

The Middleman (TV) 
Wendy Watson, The Middleman, Noser (The Middleman)

What happens to Wendy and Noser's friendship when he discovers her job as a Middleman-in-training? Or how about some straight-up Middleman &amp; Wendy saving the universe (or one small patch of it) hijinks? What happens if aliens crash Art Crawl? Or zombies? Does Wendy put her vast knowledge of zombie movies to work?

Otoh, I do ship Wendy and the Middleman, so if you want to have aliens make them do it (or make them get married! I love marriages of convenience that become real marriages!), or they have to huddle for warmth, or have to fake date for a case, that'd be amazing.

I love this show and its characters a lot and there is never enough fic, so I'll be happier than a bird with a French fry if we matched on this. I'd like the story to match the canon tone, so please no graphic sexual violence, partner betrayal, super grim dark endings, or other grim'n'gritty type stuff. Also, please no a/b/o AUs.

Six of Crows Series - Leigh Bardugo 
Inej Ghafa, Kaz Brekker

Inej is my favorite and I ship her and Kaz hard. Some potential ideas: tell me about the hours they spent trying to figure out that locked room murder mentioned at the beginning of Six of Crows (obviously neither of them guessed correctly), or Inej's first few months with the Dregs and their slow descent into \"oh no! feelings!\" especially if there's a lot of stoic pining going on. I adore stoical pining. Tell me about how they have fraught UST in planning sessions or at the end of the day when Inej visits his room, but they have to put that aside to do a job.

I'd also love to read about how the reunion with Inej's parents goes.

Or tell me how they slowly (so slowly) start to work around Kaz's issues. Maybe they have to share a bed, or pretend to be a couple for a con, or this time, Kaz gets hurt (no need to dwell on how) and Inej has to tend his wounds and it gets all fraught again.

Alternately, tell me about Inej's adventures as the captain of her own ship, living on the high seas and being the scourge of slavers everywhere. (And then she could come back to Ketterdam every few months for waffles with Kaz and they have a long distance relationship with lots of veiled yearning in the letters he writes to her; maybe she provides him with dirt on foreign powers and pirate kings, as well.)

If case fic/heist fic is your thing, tell me about some unbelievable heist Kaz planned and the gang executed! Either pre- or post-canon (I'm okay with Matthias making an amazing yet unexplained recovery if that's what you want to do!). I would enjoy a story where Nikolai hires Kaz and he has to get the band back together to pull off some amazing heist in Ravka or even on the high seas. My absolute DNWs are graphic sexual violence, a/b/o, onscreen child harm (obviously a story set while Inej is scuttling slavers would have some disturbing content but no need to dwell on it) and super grim dark endings.

Timeless (TV 2016) 
Lucy Preston, Wyatt Logan

I just want them to bang! Is that so wrong? Um, I mean, I would be happy to see them pine a little more and then hook up, or maybe they have to do it for the timeline, or they have to fake being a couple again (I love fake dating A LOT, so you can never go wrong there for me), or there's only one bed again (another favorite trope!), or maybe one of them goes on a trip in the lifeboat and the other doesn't and then the one who stayed in the present doesn't remember them? So there has to be timeline finagling to get back to each other?

I don't honestly care that much about time travel except as background trappings for hijinks and fancy costumes, and I definitely don't care about Rittenhouse, except for how it can facilitate some hot Wyatt/Lucy action. Bossy know-it-all/Reckless hothead=Yay! Please no graphic sexual violence, partner betrayal, a/b/o, or grim dark endings!

Star Wars: Battlefront II: Inferno Squad - Christie Golden 
Seyn Marana, Iden Versio

I want more Seyn Marana. I love her to pieces and I'm horribly distraught over where Inferno Squad left her. I'd really like to see something dealing with Seyn's time as a handler? Or her time as a sniper? Maybe there's a good plot there for her eidetic memory being the reason she chose long-distance combat rather than front line combat. Really, I just love the ISB world building and I want to see more spy adventures.

I also really love Iden Versio. I love her relationship with her family. I love her relationship with her squad. I love her drive to be the best of the best in order to stand independent of her dad's shadow. I loooove that her dad's nickname is THE GENERAL. It's not dad, it's THE GENERAL. I want to read more about Iden's childhood. I want to know more about Iden's relationship with Hask. I secretly want to know if Iden knows Wedge or Hobbie or Soontir Fel from their pilot training.

My do-not-wants mostly revolve around body horror, bathroom play, pregnancies, and infantilism. I do not subscribe to the Empire = Evil theory. I believe the Empire and the Rebellion have their pros and cons, so I'd appreciate the fic refrain from going too deep into real-world political bias. Also, in my fantasy version of this space opera, I believe gender bias is not a thing: we have examples of men and women in the imperial ranks through equal achievement, and I'd like to keep it that way.

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 
Wes Janson (X-Wing), Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian (X-Wing), Iella Wessiri (X-Wing)

Wes Janson is bae. Hobbie is Wes's bae. Iella is just amazing. I would love a fic with any or all of these champs.

Wes Janson is my #1 Space Husband, so anything that you want to write including him will make my day. I'm 90% convinced that Wes and Hobbie have been in an open relationship since the beginning and they are their only touch-stones for reality. I think that if one of them died, the other would just unravel on the spot and cease to exist. With that in mind, I think there's potential for some pretty angsty fic, or value in some pretty god damn fluffy fic. TBH, I could take these two in a coffee shop AU and still be ecstatic. (I mean, Hobbie is the guy that has flown to Argentina to smell the flowers and get soil samples so he knows where his coffee is from, and Wes is totally the guy drawing dicks in his latte art. WHERE IS THE LIE?)

Iella is the best. She's smart, funny, cute, dedicated, competent -- she's a law enforcement officer and super spy, but also has time to effortlessly diffuse Janson's distractions and still be secret agent mother of two. She has a ton of potential to be a badass, but she's often written off as the wife figure. I'd love to see her in the spotlight, holding her own.

My do-not-wants mostly revolve around body horror, bathroom play, pregnancies, and infantilism. I do not subscribe to the Empire = Evil theory. I believe the Empire and the Rebellion have their pros and cons, so I'd appreciate the fic refrain from going too deep into real-world political bias.

The Big O 
Angel (The Big O)

Angel is my absolute favorite character from Big O. I love that she's sexy, sassy, and smart. I love that she gives Roger a run for his money. I love that she's playing both sides the entire time. I was absolutely blown away by the reveal that she's the reset button and everything revolves around her. How many times has she done that? How many times have they run through the simulation? Does she always make the same decisions?

I'd love something psychological from this. Or something silly. Or maybe it's just Groundhog Day starring Angel as Bill Murray. I've nominated Big O for years and have never seen it cross my dash. This could be the year! :D

My do-not-wants mostly revolve around body horror, bathroom play, pregnancies, and infantilism. I'm up for physical or psychological trauma on this one (I mean, those scars are canon), but I'd rather avoid any potential sexual abuse.

響け! ユーフォニアム | Hibike! Euphonium (Anime) 

I ship Reina/Kumiko, Kumiko/Asuka, and Nozomi/Mizore. I also like Natsuki/Yuuko, though I wouldn't want it to be the main ship. Asuka is my best girl, and I'd love anything that involves her being her spastic, histrionic, lovable self. Bonus points if Kumiko sees right through her. I'd also love to see Kumiko breaking through Reina's shell, or really anything with Nozomi and Mizore since they are so underappreciated! I definitely see Mizore as neurodivergent, btw. A LL!/iM@S-style idol AU would also be so much fun.

I ship Ruby/Maru, You/Riko, Yohane/Riko, and especially Kanan/Mari. Mari, like Asuka, is my best girl, and I'd love anything that involves her being wonderful and fun and over-the-top. Maybe Kanan tries to tone down their relationship in front of the others while Mari constantly plays it up. And/or Mari tries to get Kanan to admit she's hot for her. Alternatively (or additionally), Yohane being a terrible flirt (and maybe being embarrassed by it later) would be amazing. (I'm thinking like Kashima from GSNK or even Tamaki from Ouran.) Btw, I do not like Chika, so the less Chika, the better.

Maybe Minami and Anya go on tour together, or Rina tags along with Takumi on a motorcycle ride. (Double date with Riina and Natsuki? Amusing hijinks re: Rina and Riina having almost the same name?)

Young Wizards - Diane Duane 

I love everyone and everything about this series, but especially the philosophy, the gentle humour, and the blend between science and wizardry. My soft preference is a light-hearted gen story about any combination of any of the non-humans. But if you've a story you've been looking for an excuse to write, please go for it! 

If you want a few more ideas/tropes: I do especially like the aeschetic universes and kernels, the worldgates, and the Crossings. I really love close friendship tropes. Blockbuster action fic? Day in the life? Cultural misunderstandings? Mystery?

Additional note: at time of signing up, I haven't read any of the Interim Errantry stories (including Lifeboats and the Ordeals) yet. I don't mind spoilers, but I won't get references.

Temeraire - Naomi Novik 
Temeraire, Alice Pemberton, William Laurence, Emily Roland

Squicks: pregnancy/kidfic, deathfic, dark/horror. 

I'd like a gen story combining any or all of the characters in the canon! I have two prompts you can consider:

1) Emily and Mrs. Pemberton: amateur sleuths in Victorian England who FIGHT CRIME! or any alternate universe exploring a friendship and/or partnership between them. (I'm also fond of sci-fi/futuristic AUs.)

2) Dragons live for something like a couple centuries, so how are Temeraire and the other dragons faring near the end of their natural lives? I'm hoping to read any story set in Temeraire's future, especially if that intersects with the modern world. It can be epic or small, humourous or angsty (but not too angsty, about the level of the series is fine). Touching on Temeraire outliving Laurence and his contemporaries is fine, but I'd prefer that this isn't the main focus.

I prefer gen and lighthearted but I support the canon ships. If you want more to go on: my favourite characters are Morwen, Telemain, and Kazul. But I'd be excited to read anything really.

I like worldbuilding. What else is there in the Enchanted Forest? How did the dragons come to be in the mountains? What discussions do the characters (major or minor in any combination) have about magic and their peculiar ways of handling it? (Magic theory is my favorite thing in any fantasy series.)

Warcraft (2016) 
Taria Wrynn (Warcraft (2016)), Medivh (Warcraft (2016)), Khadgar (Warcraft (2016)), Garona Halforcen (Warcraft (2016))

Squicks: pregnancy/kidfic, deathfic, dark/horror.

Please consider one or more of the following prompts:

1) Taria/Garona royal wedding *throws sparkles*

2) Taria and Garona cautious and budding friendship, especially if politically complicated e.g. they share a light meal with a no shop talk rule and their guards are a bit twitchy, or if they keep up their friendship/correspondence in secret. Can also be pre-ship

3) Khadgar and Garona cautious and budding (secret?) friendship, especially if there are awkward misunderstandings by any character (gen prefered, ace/queerplatonic headcanons encouraged)

4) Khadgar/Medivh 'everybody lives' AU or 'no Sargeras' AU, happy ending prefered

5) If you also play Hearthstone and like the wonderful crackiness that is One Night in Karazhan, please feel free to use that as a happy AU of the above.

I don't mind if your story doesn't have all the characters though.
Additional note: everything I know about Warcraft lore is this movie, Hearthstone, that weird thing about Medivh and Garona, and other random scraps.

Girl Genius (Webcomic) 

For GG, the thing I'd want the most is interactions between any of the characters nominated- you don't need to use all of them in your fic! I'm copypasting my likes/dislikes from my letter below, and there are some more specific prompts there, but for this fandom I'm primarily fond of the interactions between the characters (or potential for interactions if they haven't met) and the lore and backstory of the comic. I'd be really up for anything involving either of those- exploration of character backstories, scenarios where some of the characters have to interact unexpectedly, explorations of an existing relationship if they have one, etc. 

Stuff I love: Hurt/comfort/angst/general sadness, speculative fic, AUs within canon (ie. role swaps, minor changes in what a character does that change everything, etc), sad romantic pining, unrequited pining!!, character studies, characters taking care of each other when one is sick or hurt, really deep platonic friendships.
DNWs: Non/dub con, underage sex (also romance with a large age gap), kidfic/pregnancy, incest, infidelity, issue-fic, radical/setting-changing AUs (ie. A/B/O, coffee shop, historical, etc), crossovers, PWP/smut as the main focus, really kinky stuff, anything that goes against a character's canon gender identity, or anything that goes against a character's canon sexuality if they have one (for those that don't I'm up for headcanons!). If any of this stuff happened in canon you're welcome to deal with it though.
Other things: I'm actually really up for violence/gore but if you do it I'd rather it be vaguely canon-compliant- nothing that seems too off for the source material. I tend to be okay with any ships that have been in canon, but if it's not I'd rather not really have anything I didn't mention in the letter.

But I'm also really interested in the world of this comic and how it's created a weird scenario where these girls are pretty much both child soldiers and huge stars, and anything exploring that lore with either of the characters in a major role is also something I'd really love (whether it's shipping or gen).

This is a case where I like all of the characters in the tagset and would enjoy something about any of them, so don't worry about including all four. The thing I loved the most about this book was finding the places where the characters connected and the slow building of the world- I really love this scenario where the basic survival part has mostly been covered and now people are trying to create a newer, happier life out of what's left. Anything with any of these characters interacting, finding each other and discovering where they've all connected before, would be awesome.

The Wicked + The Divine 
Dionysus (The Wicked + The Divine), Cassandra Igarashi | Urdr

I love these two and their relationship so much and anything about that or about either of them individually would be A+. Character studies! Speculative stuff! Friendship! Sadness! I'm also always curious about the nature of WicDiv's world and the stuff that happened in the 455 issue was exactly my jam, so anything about them interacting with those especially eldritch and awful parts that have been implied in canon is great. The only thing I really don't want is shipping fic between the two of them, because going against a character's sexuality is a DNW for me (stuff about Dio's one-sided crush would be okay, though). Also, don't worry about writing something that gets refuted by new issues- I'm gonna enjoy it anyway (especially considering there's always a decent chance in WicDiv somebody will die, so any of our hopes are liable to get crushed at any time). I'm copypasting my likes/dislikes here, but there's a bunch of prompts in my letter!

I really loved the whole story of their attempted elopement escape to England. It is so tragic and kind of romantic. I think I literally just want a fictionalized story of this friendship/love affair, the attempted escape, the angst that comes after they are caught. Either all of that together or any one part. I have read some about this, but I am certainly not an expert of any sort. I am not terribly picky about historical accuracy, especially since my own knowledge is limited. I love the potential dynamic here, the power imbalance, the potential for loyalty themes. I am certain I will enjoy most of anything that you could come up with for this ship.

Poldark (TV 2015) 
Francis Poldark, Dwight Enys

I absolutely did not expect to ever ship these two romantically but it turns out that I do! I would love to see how their relationship might develop; something like a getting-together fic perhaps. This could either be canon-compliant or canon divergence AU (including a scenario in which Francis does not die). Not that I would mind something fluffy where they are already in an established or almost established relationship. I love the idea of them happily horseback riding across the beach, joking and laughing and the romance being an extension of their friendship.

Some more hurt/comfort after Francis’ failed suicide attempt would be very welcome. Perhaps they get drunk and there is a heart-to-heart conversation which ends in kissing. (After all, Francis is known to make bad or at least impulsive choices while drunk. Dwight has also made questionable decisions when it comes to sex and love affairs, so I do not think this is too terribly farfetched.) Another mildly AU scenario I would love to see is where Francis makes a repeat suicide attempt (or perhaps his initial one did not involve a gun, or however you want to make it work). He botches that one too, but gets hurt in the process this time. Dwight saves him just in time/finds him in the aftermath and has to take care of him while he recovers. (Yes, I enjoy hurt/comfort a great deal!)

No Dwight/Caroline please.

I would love a Bert/Roland slash fic. Maybe Roland’s thoughts after Jericho Hill. I want him to actually go through the process of accepting the death of his best friend/lover not just sort of shrug it off as he seems to shrug off a lot of things during the books. Or something post-Majis with Cuthbert being the main reason Roland can recover and get back living his life (best he can, anyway) after the trauma of what had happened there. Any kind of hurt/comfort or Roland-being-protective scenario that you’d like, really, would make me very happy. But it does not have to be angst; I very much enjoy fluff and happiness and horseback rides in the summer and kisses in the grass and all manner of cuteness.

Some ideas: They get caught up in another emergency/disaster and have to rely on each other/commit to some impressive teamwork. Post-canon getting together fic with lots of sexual tension and maybe pining. (Clearly, Alexei developed an appreciation for Andrei at the end of the movie, so taking that to the next step…) Russia is not the most accepting country to be gay in, so some scenarios (funny or serious) with them having to hide their relationship and sneak around and not give themselves away during those long trans-Atlantic flights. I would enjoy something that explores of highlights how their personalities contrast, but also how they are compatible, and how that would play out in a relationship. (I might add some more prompts, so please check my letter!)

Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner 
Kuzunoha Raidou XIV, Narumi Shouhei

Devil Summoner Kuzunoha Raidou XIV vs. King Abaddon is one of my favorite games of all time.  The Taisho period is my favorite in Japanese history; I’m very into the Taisho roman aesthetic, and overall there’s just something very romantic about the period -- it was a historical moment that straddled tradition and the past and modernity and the future in a lot of very interesting ways. I think the DSRK games really feed into that, you know? In a lot of ways the setting feeds into the game; Raidou is a traditional figure, supported by a cast of demons, who has to keep order in the capital - and inevitably chaos comes from the interaction of tradition and modernity. these are strong words for games in which robot zombie Rasputin and LITERAL SATAN are the antagonists, huh? Narumi/Raidou is my forever ship. I like that Narumi is technically there to keep an eye on Raidou but that in the day-to-day Raidou has to keep Narumi in line, I like that they’re opposites, Narumi all flash against Raidou’s quiet, Narumi representing modernity while Raidou is tradition. I LIKE THE AGE DIFFERENCE AND I LIKE THAT THEY’RE BOSS AND SUBORDINATE DON’T LOOK AT ME and I also like that they’re equals at the same time. I like that Narumi tries to take care of Raidou and protect him, in his own way, because he’s the adult. I like that Raidou doesn’t need it, not really, but that Narumi does it anyway. I’m also very happy to get genfic, to be honest - I think the 1920s time period is a great opportunity for some period gen about mundane day-to-day (with demons. And zombie robot Rasputin? I don’t know). 

PROMPTS/SUGGESTIONS: what happens in tsukigata stays in tsukigata; rebuilding after the end of the second game; narumi and raidou solve a case that seems at first to be demonic but turns out to be totally mundane; raidou has been a bit overworked and has an exam coming up and narumi offers to tutor him in spite of the fact he’s in wildly over his head; five times raidou acted his age; five mysteries narumi solved without raidou’s help; four secrets about narumi raidou keeps and one he lets slip; narumi unknowingly helps raidou recruit a demon; raidou gets caught in a demon’s time loop hijinks; raidou is placed in charge of bookkeeping for the office; shibari

Akatsuki no Yona | Yona of the Dawn 
Yona (Akatsuki no Yona), Son Hak, Soo-Won (Akatsuki no Yona)

I watched Akatsuki no Yona this year, which I realize is a hundred years too late, and I was so surprised by how genuinely good it is and how much I loved it. Full disclosure, as of writing this letter I have completed the anime but have not read the manga -- it’s on my list! So a lot of my comments and requests are heavily influenced by the anime, but I should be caught up by the time assignments are due, so feel free to write me either something anime or manga-based. The selling point for this series for me is the triangle (if you can even call something that is so contentious but also completely jealously-proof between Yona, Hak, and Soo-won. All of my favorite parts in the series center on their relationship. Overall, I guess the theme of what I like about all of them is how conflicted they are; they’re fundamentally opposed to each other, they can’t forgive each other, but they also still miss each other. Everything about Yona/Soo-won/Hak is miserable and complicated, but I’d love to read anything about the three of them, shipfic or gen. I would ask that whatever you do involves all three characters; I’d rather not read just Soo-won/Hak where Yona barely appears, or Yona/Hak with no Soo-won. If this doesn’t work for you -- I also really like the dragons, and I’d love to read a more general story about Yona, Hak, and the gang! As mentioned above, I really like full-cast fic, and I’d love to read something about or from the point of view of the other characters (of the main boys, the only one I’d prefer not be a POV character is Zeno; I’m currently anime-only so he is a total stranger to me).

PROMPTS/SUGGESTIONS: casefic in which soo-won and yona’s team are independently trying to solve a problem (and meet in the middle); yona, hak, or soo-won acquire the power to go back in time and change one thing (and they have to decide how to use it); au where everything is the same but soo-won is one of the dragons; five lives hak, yona, and soo-won shared (or didn't share); five secrets yona knows about hak and soo-won (and one she doesn’t); four things hak misses about soo-won and one thing he doesn’t; five things soo-won regrets; five things the dragons don’t understand about the relationship between yona, soo-won, and hak; modern times businesspeople au (maybe soo-won orchestrated a hostile takeover of yona’s dad’s company? Maybe they live together in a three bedroom apartment and no one suffers); have you ever watched fushigi yuugi wrap party prohibited bus trip chapter of women’s hot springs (three parts)? you know what to do

LIKES: shipfic, gen, casefic, pre-canon, mid-canon, canon continuation, \"five things\" fics, groundhog day style time reset hijinks, character studies, found families, friends to lovers - especially with pining in the interim, fake relationships leading to real relationships, loyaltykink, humor, introspection, happy endings

Cassie says she’s “whatever it takes” – where might that take her from here? Is it possible she could succumb to the rivalries of her peers, or completely ditch her attempts at artistic authenticity while hating herself for it? I also interested in all we’ve seen of Cassie’s romantic (or potentially romantic) relationships with other comics – Clay, Bill, Eddie – and how they might add another layer of difficulty to her place in the group as “token girl.”

Post-Classical Hollywood RPF 
Marilyn Monroe, Milton Greene

\"The loves of our lives aren’t always our lovers, and Marilyn’s great romance never ended in marriage. Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller loved Marilyn, but Milton understood her. For Marilyn, who said she felt like ‘a fish out of water,’ being understood was everything. Milton was the closest she came to those elusive words ‘soul mate’—a concept she believed in until the day she died.\"

There are so many conflicting stories about whether history/reality ships these two as hard as I do. Their relationship is a many faceted one, with many possible interpretations, and I’d love to read something that takes on the question whether their relationship was truly only consummated through Milton’s camera, or if there was more to it than that.

Mysterious Mr. Quin - Agatha Christie 
Mr. Satterthwaite, Mr. Harley Quin (Agatha Christie)

After reading this book and Christie's other Quin stories, I was most struck by how completely infatuated Mr. Satterthwaite is with Mr. Quin, and I'd really like a story that developed on that theme; slash would be my preference, but gen dealing seriously with Satterthwaite's emotions and Quin's response to them would be fine as well. Casefic is very welcome as well, particularly given Quin's tendency to only show up when there's something for the Love Detectives to do, but feel free to set something in between cases as well -- maybe Satterthwaite tries to hold Quin back after a case is completed, or he's trying other methods to get his attention?

Honestly, though -- whether it's slash, casefic, both or neither, a story that gets at the very odd emotional core of these stories (Satterthwaite as worldly but not jaded, with his regrets about his own inexperience and ever-building fascination with Quin; Quin with his clear admiration for Satterthwaite in turn, and the juxtaposition of his rather bland, passive persona with a sinister side) will make me very happy. Viva the Love Detectives!

Steve Jackson's Sorcery! - Steve Jackson 

Oh, man, I love the Sorcery! books. These were a staple of my childhood and a gateway to my fantasy gaming hobby, and there's really nothing here I don't still adore.  I would prefer gen in this fandom, please; I'm not opposed to sex or romance as an element of a Sorcery! story, but I'd prefer it not be the focus.

I'd really love to see some worldbuilding for this fandom, building up the characters and scraps of story that the books touch on but don't discuss in depth. If there's some bit of the books that intrigued you, tell me what you think's going on there! I'm open to practically anything here, but here are a few ideas:

* A story about one of the creatures and cultures we see in passing: the Red-Eyes, the Sightmasters, the She-Satyrs, that weird tentacle cook back in Khare... what are their lives like? (How do natives even navigate Khare, anyway, besides \"very carefully?\") 

* Something about one of the places on the map of Kakhabad that we don't see in Sorcery!. I've always wondered about that southern coast and the Daddu-Yadu and Daddu-Ley caves, personally.

* Since the Serpent of Time is on the character list, I'd love to see the Serpents and their creation fleshed out a bit; that illusionary god-hydra in Mampang is one of the most flavorful encounters in the entire series, and seriously, how does something like that even happen? I'm aware of the broad overview with the Archmage and the hydra, but tell me more!

Mother 2: Gyiyg no Gyakushuu | EarthBound 
Jeff Andonuts

First things first: while Jeff is my only requested character, I love everyone in the tag set, so feel free to use whoever you like! It's all good here.

Earthbound is an old favorite fandom for me, and I've fallen back in love with it this year. I love how the game feels real and personal despite having the fairly broadly-drawn characters typical of a JRPG, with the adolescent cast used to strengthen the game's themes of pain and growth, and the mixture of moments of darkness with an overall atmosphere of hope and humor. I could go on forever about Earthbound, but I'll try to focus on some prompt-shaped objects:

* I love the whole ensemble, but Jeff is my eternal favorite; I love his earnestness, his impulsiveness, his completely misplaced doubts (about his being a good friend, say, vs. about buying explosives from a random shady dude). I'd love to see Jeff-focused stories about the events of canon or afterwards, whether that's just his return to Snow Wood or later life; angst and difficulties are welcome, but I'd like to see them overcome them with the help of his friends, new and old.

* Post-canon fic about the main characters growing up and finding themselves as adults is my catnip in this fandom, especially ones where they remain close to one another. Where do they go after they've saved the world, as four of the most talented young people of their generation? What bizarre shenanigans do you come up with to justify spending time together, or do they even need excuses? This can be serious character-focused stuff, further adventures, extremely goofy stuff where they start a bad band or rent a share house for the summer... and if Tony can come to and Jeff helps him integrate into the group, that's even better.

* This is a fandom where I'm very open to both gen and shippy/smutty stuff. I multiship pretty heavily; Jeff/Tony is my biggest ship at the moment, but I also dig Ness/Paula, Paula/Jeff, and all kinds of combinations of OT3/4/5s with the main Chosen and Tony. I would prefer that any smut be futurefic where everyone involved is 18+, and would tend towards affectionate/sweet/maybe cute-awkward stuff, but otherwise I'm quite open.

Beanworld (Comics) 

Beanworld is an amazing ride, and the last volume sparked so many questions for me! I'd really love to read a story dealing with the rooted-setting-entities of the Beanworld (Gran'Ma'Pa and the Fix-It Shop) and their greater relations to the Beanworld, because the bits we have are tantalizing. We know that the current cycle is wildly off-course, but how would a \"normal\" one have gone? Gran'Ma'Pa still listens to and answers prayers, but would those answers be more direct if not for the poisoning sustained during Mr. Spook's origin? Contrariwise, is the Fix-It-Shop doing *more* talking than normal to try and get the ambulatory elements of the system up to speed?  Do Gran'Ma'Pa and the Fix-It Shop communicate with one another? Do they have plans to make this all work out, somehow, before the end of the cycle? Feel free to give me your own worldbuilding speculations here -- there are so many possibilities and I'd love to read them all.

This is another canon where I love the whole ensemble, so feel free to use who you like! I nominated Mr. Spook and Professor Garbanzo because they relate most closely to the setting-characters (and also because they're my favorites, because I am shameless). If you don't feel up for big worldbuilding, I'd also love some \"day-in-the-life\" stuff about the beans living their lives, either unseen stuff from spring or a continuing unfolding of summer. This world and cast are so vibrant and delightful that I'll happily read about an ordinary day in their lives.

I'd prefer gen in this fandom, please. (I don't even know how smut would work, or if it could work, so... let's not try. My guilty-pleasure ship is Mr. Spook/Proffy, but God knows you don't have to write that, because I still haven't figured out how to do it plausibly.) I would prefer a tone close to the canon, and no need to ignore or underplay its occasionally dark and violent themes, but I'd rather it not get any darker than what the world already is.

Unknown Armies 

Okay, this is where the weird dark stuff lives. I would prefer no sexual violence or degradation in this fandom, and a minimum of extended gore/torture/extreme violence, but otherwise? Get crazy with the Cheez Whiz, friend. Unknown Armies is a fucked-up world, and feel free to bring the pain.

I love Unknown Armies for its human-centric focus -- a modern horror setting without classical \"monsters,\" just the terrible power of obsession -- and the combination of down-to-earth themes and extreme high weirdness. I'm not really interested in the canonical cosmic-level NPCs (Dermott Arkane, the Freak, et al.), and am overall mostly interested in street- or global-level goings-on; beyond that, though, I'd love to hear any story you can tell me about the UA setting, any edition. A few ideas:

* One of the best parts of UA is its rumors and sundry scraps and story hooks. Elaborate on one of those! What's up with the Wal-Mart fortune-teller, and what does he use all those lemons for? The spot in Delaware nobody can remember, or the town on Pennsylvania a Dipsomancer dreamed up? The Sex Ghost?

* Tell me about a day in the life of the Agents of a Room of Renunciation (one of the canon ones, or one of your own devising). Is it mostly just intercepting weirdos, or is there real cosmic work to be done? Do any rooms connect to or communicate with one another? Do rooms ever change, and what happens to their agents when they do?

* The exploits of a group of non-magick-users embroiled in the Occult Underground; I've always liked the \"Tuxedo Squadron\" idea from the UA 2E core (stage magicians who went after the real secrets, discovered they weren't worth it, and are still stuck in the subculture), but there are a lot of options. How do you fight magickal geeks when your main weapon is common sense and not being bound to all the restrictions of magick taboo?

In general, I'm easy to please, so feel free to go wherever you feel called, regardless of these optional details.

If you'd like more direction, I'd prefer a lighter story to a darker one, any rating is OK, and if you choose to write a relationship story, please avoid partner betrayal. (Otherwise, I've been known to say, \"Anything goes so long as the main characters make it out alive and happy, sane is optional.\" Frankly, alive is optional, too. I'm a fan of holiday ghost stories, if you want to go there. [grin])

Most importantly, have fun with whatever you choose to write!

-------------------------------

Now, to turn to specifics....

Talk about relationships formed in intense circumstances! What happens afterwards? Gen, slash, genderbent, it's all fine. Feel free to go AU, if you find yourself thinking something like \"zombie hunters\" or \"space explorers\" -- I'm just fascinated by the way they so easily become friends while worried about Edward's life.

Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006) 
Taylor Gentry, Leslie Vernon

This year, I have only requested Taylor and Leslie, since that previous treat scratched my Doug/Taylor itch. However, feel free to include any of the characters from the movie if your story requires them (Doug, Eugene, Jamie, Doc, etc.). I would love to see basically anything you can imagine happened after the movie ends. We see Leslie come back to life (because, of course), so what's next? He would definitely go after Taylor, but how would that work out? Would she become the Jamie to his Eugene and be okay with his chosen path? Or would she fight against it? She was obviously having conflicting feelings towards him during the film, so there's surely some grey area to play with there. I think any further exploration of that dynamic would be fascinating because it could go several different ways. (If you're feeling really wild, I also wouldn't say no to a crossover with another famous slasher movie - Jason, Freddy, Ghostface, Michael Myers, etc. Or something super meta with Cabin in the Woods. But I'm in no way demanding you do something like that, just throwing it out there.)

I, pretty obviously, ship Taylor/Leslie, but understand it's not a ship that everyone can get behind. Serial Killer/Final Girl - it's, well, complicated. So, gen fic is completely okay here. Any rating will do, and character deaths are acceptable for this particular fandom (whether it's the requested characters or other characters from the film).

For a Good Time Call... (2012) 
Katie Steele, Lauren Powell

The core of the film is how these two opposites end up working so well together and find out in the process how much they balance each other out. I would love to see what happens after the movie ends. Does their business flourish and expand? Do they maybe start another business that isn't sex-based and become badass moguls? Or do they just stay badass moguls in the sex work industry? 

I would definitely be down for Katie/Lauren, because HOW DID THAT NOT ACTUALLY HAPPEN? I mean, they literally end the movie confessing their love for each other while having an unintentionally innuendo filled conversation. DON'T TELL ME THIS MOVIE ISN'T A ROMCOM. IT JUST DIDN'T END WITH THEM KISSING. So what if we change that ending and Katie actually loses her virginity to Lauren and not Sean? Or keep the ending the same, but have Katie realize that as much as she likes Sean, she truly loves Lauren. What if they get a little hot and bothered during one of their work calls and take it to a new level? (Or a slower burn with them going from friends-to-lovers over the course of their continuing relationship as friends/business partners.) I would be fine with a polyamorous Sean/Katie/Lauren thing, but I don't really have any interest in Sean/Katie separately. (I'm cool with any other film characters showing up where needed, but mostly just focused on the two leads.)

How to Be Single (2016) 
Tom (How to Be Single (2016)), Lucy (How to Be Single (2016))

While I loved that this movie didn't end with everyone finding love, or ending up with the person you thought they might, that doesn't mean I don't want fic to fuss with that ending a little bit. I just found Anders and Alison so completely charming together and wanted more of them together, so here we are!

One idea I had was something years after the movie ends. We get a hint that Tom is at least willing to change his ways, so maybe he's finally ready to be the guy that can settle down and build a life with someone when he runs into Lucy who is recently divorced from George. (I'm okay if one or both of them have a kid from a previous relationship, but I'm also okay with absolutely no kids.) I just didn't feel Lucy/George were built to last and she just went with the first decent guy who was ready to get married. So maybe they just need some years to pass before they're in the right place to be with each other. Feel free to create stumbling blocks towards that happy ending, or have it end bittersweet (just not fully bitter), I'm game for whatever. Whatever tone you want to set works for me too, whether it's angsty, sweet, fluffy, funny, sexy, whatever you want to do.

I'm cool with any characters from the movie showing up if it suits the story. Would prefer for Alice/Tom to NOT be a thing though.

The Purge (Movies) 
Charlie Roan, Leo Barnes

It's time to be completely honest, dear writer. I am 100% requesting this because I want Charlie and Leo to hook up. The chemistry between Elizabeth Mitchell and Frank Grillo was fantastic, and they're both just so attractive. So, yep, that's what I want. She's now the President and he's the head of Secret Service, so this is just ripe for all sorts of clandestine encounters and them trying to pretend there's nothing there and be all serious about their VERY IMPORTANT JOBS, but the heart wants what it wants, right? RIGHT?

I do understand if you offered this fandom and aren't in to the ship and I won't be mad if you write them being badasses together without the romance or sex parts. It would be interesting to see a pro-Purge faction try to come after them, and I imagine even though she's ended the Purge, there will still be groups who want it to continue and will come after Charlie to make that happen. Play with the concept of the Purge as much as you'd like, and where you think the story might evolve based on the ending. Since we're (sadly) not likely to get another film with both Charlie and Leo, the world is your oyster.

PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE: Ankle trauma. References to or depictions of mass shootings. (Use of a gun is okay, just no mass casualties, please.

Scientific Method Universe - Kris Ripper 

I love everyone in this bar! Any combo of characters is great. I love porn but it's not necessary for me to enjoy your story. Major do-not-wants for me are pregnancy loss or heavy hurt/comfort. I love established relationship stories, humor, feelings, sex, edgy kink. I'm not super into stories that center jealousy, though dealing with some jealousy is fine. I admit that the trio (Will, Hugh, and Truman) have my heart, but I'd also be into any story that moves you about the other characters.

I find the magic fascinating and the difficult decisions made heartbreaking. My only major trigger is pregnancy loss, and I\"ve read all three books.

Jewish Scripture & Legend 
Rut | Ruth (Jewish Scripture & Legend), Naomi (Jewish Scripture & Legend)

I think the verse \"Wherever you go I will go\" is one of the most beautiful verses in the Tanakh and all of scripture. It gives me chills every time I read it. The relationship between Ruth and Naomi is so lovely, I would love anything you want to say about them. I tend to think about the women of the tanakh from an economic perspective, and from that perspective what the two of them are facing is so intense--in a society where a woman's economic well-being is so tied to the ability to have children, Naomi is facing not only a life without her beloved husband and sons but economic destitution and an old age as a beggar, and Ruth is signing on for privation and hardship and probably literally starving to death when she could go back and have a perfectly happy life without Naomi. That is super intense! What is Ruth thinking? Why would she do that?  What is their life like in the first weeks after the men die and when they're traveling and when they're back in Bethlehem, when they're facing the shock of their lives being turned upside down, without any real hope or options? What does Naomi think when Ruth first tells her about Boaz, is she afraid or hopeful? Does she worry or have second thoughts or feel guilty about what she sends Ruth to do? Does Ruth question her, or feel hopeful, or ashamed? Is Ruth happy or relieved in her life with Boaz, or does she feel any regret? Do either of them have any prophetic inkling of the line of David that will descend from them?

One hundred percent optional but this could be a really fun one to go AU. Ruth and Naomi as sci-fi space refugees? Ruth and Naomi beat poets on the road?  Present day Ruth and Naomi?

Paper Magicians Trilogy - Charlie N. Holmberg 
Pritwin Bailey, Patrice Aviosky

I would be happy with fic about EITHER of these characters separately, or both of them together, or one as a major and one a minor character.

I am fascinated by the worldbuilding in this series. All the different kind of magic are fascinating, and folding especially. It may be looked down on as fragile or mostly a party trick, but there are so many opportunities! Especially for communication, with paper magic! I'd love to read about some different ways spells are used, or ways magic and magicians affect societal structures, or the perspective of a \"normal\" person hiring a magician, or magic-gone-wrong hijinks and shenanigans. 
For Pritwin specifically, he seems to have made pretty good now but clearly harbors some lingering angst about his school days. Is living well the best revenge or hollow? How did he come to peace with his career as a folder? What's he most or least proud of, his greatest successes or worst failures?

For Patrice specifically, she hits my giant competence kink hard. She seems to be one of relatively few women in power--what's her career been like? How has Tagis Praff changed since she was a student or under her leadership? She seems to have an amazing ability to read people and judge what they want or need, even when they don't know themselves. What's a time when she figured out the best solution for a problem before the person involved even knew themselves? What are her greatest successes or failures?

To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995) 
Vida Boheme, Carol Ann (To Wong Foo)

I just love that this movie exists where drag queens are stranded in a small town and there's a happy ending. For these two characters, while I would love to read about a romantic and/or sexual relationship (the chemistry!) I would also adore a friendship fic. Or even a compare-and-contrast... maybe they never see each other again, but what are their parallel lives like? A missing scene from the movie would be lovely, or the growth of a relationship post-movie, or maybe one of them calls the other out of the blue with a desperate request. I would love anything that shows how these two women challenge each other, bring out the best in each other, and help each other reach beyond what either could imagine on their own.

I really just want to know what happens to Larita and Jim after the end of the movie! I'd love it most if they get some kind of happy ending. Shippiness happy ending with the two of them together a huge plus.

What about his DJing/synthwave musician career? Does he have a bandcamp? Does he tweet? Is he the only AI??? Can he and The Tick go on an adventure together? 

OR, what about The Tick and Arthur's step dad? That was so cute and pure! Does The Tick have a new friend? Does he remember Arthur's step dad after a few days, or does that memory go away?

Holy crap, this movie hit all my buttons. A bisexual Cold War spy kicking ass, taking no shit, and the most competent of them all? Good lord, that was hot and awesome. 

I don't even know what to ask for here besides MOOOOORE. What does Lorraine do now? Is she going back to America to continue to be with the CIA? Or is she done? Was she ever an MI6 girl, or was she always secretly CIA? Was she always truly a triple agent or did she ever toy with siding with the Soviets? Is her name even Lorraine Broughton? What is the story with James Gasciogne? What were her real feelings toward Delphine Lasalle?

Go crazy!! Tell me all your thoughts! My only request is don't make an AU with Delphine alive. It was horrible that she died, but it was also an honest comment on the history of the period and the shit that female spies face in the field. Make the horrible tragedy of it count for something.

So, full disclosure. I'm a southern girl that grew up right where this film is supposed to take place. In a tiny town about a half hour drive from the Charlotte Moter Speedway (which is in Concord, next to the NEW WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS LONG AGO Concord Mills, a giant mall that was THE place to socialize &amp; only place to play Dance Dance Revolution for like four counties). In high school, every club and arts class would do a weekend selling food stuffs at the Speedway to raise money for whatever big thing we were doing that year. Good lord, the times my chorus teacher had us sing at small events there in our long, black dresses ;_;. 

So, this thing spoke to me. It laughingly got shit wrong, but whatever! NASCAR is America, as one of the characters proclaims. LOL, omg, that is so deep fried as fuck. I LOVE IT. 

Give me another heist. That's all I want. Another deep fried heist. We need a southern Ocean's Eleven situation here. I want more of Mellie Logan being the brains of this operation with her most excellent southern hair. I want to see more of Sarah Grayson, FBI (former FBI??). Is she romancing Clyde for cover or for real? And lordy do I need more of the Bang Bros, Joe, Sam, and Fish. Also, Channing Tatum was a such a cute dad to Sadie. Let's get some more of that!

More cameos of Nascar drivers, the better. Remember: we hate Jeff Gordon because he enunciates, and we love Dale Jr. because he is Dale Jr. and too pure for this world.

PLEASE DON'T BE AFRAID IF YOU DON'T KNOW AREA OR NASCAR. I won't care that you don't know NC or West Virginia, I won't judge you if you don't like Nascar or understand it. I have Stockholm syndrome of growing up here and have a certain affection for it. THE MOVIE didn't even get a lot of stuff right. YOU HAVE FUN.

Clue (1985) 

I am going crazy and adding this on a whim. This is one of my favorite movies. 

I am going to throw a lot of things at the wall here. Go crazy with what ever inspires you!

- early 1960s Clue sequel! Mod style? Culture shock of money vs NOT!money? Hippies and counter revolutionaries? Is Mr. Green still with the FBI? Is Cold War a red herring? Are the Weathermen involved? Man, fashion and cultural changes!!

- another ending? Are some of the assistants to Mr. Body not dead? Was someone pretending to be dead and is now out for revenge? Did Col. Mustard do it all? Or was Professor Plum actually hiding some intelligence? 

- an epilogue: maybe Communism wasn't such a red herring after all.

Red (Movies) 

I just want Han Cho Bai clinging tightly to a door handle while Victoria Winslow cackles as she drives fast and takes turns too quickly.

Okay, I want a lot of things. Han Cho cracks me up. He just wants to kill you in his rightful vengeance, why won't you die, Frank?! He is so cool and collected, then... we get these jokers. They eat all his snacks, steal his plane, and save the world. He hates them so much.

Tell me things about Han Cho! Who are the people around him? Are they his regular crew or does he work alone? Is he technically in exile from South Korea after Frank burned him out of the intelligence service? Does he do things besides be the biggest and bestest assassin in the world? Does he still try to kill Frank? Especially if he doesn't pay up? Does he get dragged on other missions with this group of crazy people again? Tell me anything and everything!!

The bond between these two, and everything it contains: bickering, mutually dependent work, shared hidden ideologies, the dynamics of a 1940s workplace and familial hierarchies, as well as the occasional discrepancies which occur when their expectations of each other do not match (and what they expect the other should expect, and I refer of course to the infamous shirtclutching incident) are what I love.

Gattaca (1997) 
Jerome Eugene Morrow

If we matched on this, I'm sorry, you definitely got my most complicated request. 

The main thing that I'm looking for here is some added character depth/agency for Jerome. Gattaca has been one of my all-time favourite films since it came out, but 20 years later I find the ablism in the way Jerome functions largely as a plot device to support Vincent's story disturbing, particularly for a movie that's essentially about ablism. Please give Jerome his own story. 

Feel free to pair him with Vincent or Irene or both or an OC or make it gen, but please try not to desexualize him or fetishize his disability without his in-story consent. If you feel like writing in the canon setting, I would love to see either the ending altered so he lives or an exploration of his suicidality. I am also totally open to AU here; it would be super interesting the see these characters in a different setting.

Two/Android is definitely the Dark Matter ship of my heart, and season 3 gave us so much interesting backstory for them. I would love love love getting-together fic for them, particularly that deals with the added emotional complication of the past Rebecca/Shaw.

Alternatively, I would also love any sort of Raza chosen family fic, either gen or some sort of poly something. I'm not super into Two/Three or Two/Six as big romantic couples, though I'm good with them loving each other and fucking as part of a larger something. I would prefer it be future!fic if Five is involved in sexytimes. I'm more interested in happy group fluff than orgies.

Calvin and Hobbes grow up but they hold on to the magic that existed when they were kids, although it's a rocky road at times. 

I would prefer that you avoid stories where Calvin comes to live entirely in the real world, *and* stories where he lives entirely in a new fantasy world. Calvin and Hobbes' world feels to me one with feet on the ground and head in the clouds, and I would love if you could preserve that sense.

AU in which Roxanne is an alien (whether she's the 'Megamind' parallel or the 'Metroman' is up to you, but I'd love to see Megamind as her counterpart and then they kiss)
-Gender fuckery
-Minion focus (how old was he when the planet was destroyed?)
--On that note, how do the brainbots think?
--What was life on Minion's and Wayne's first planets like? What did their parents do? What did those societies look like? How did it cope with imminent death -- did other babies get propelled out into the world? If not, why Megamind specifically?
-Wayne eventually growing up, after the movie, and doing something meaningful with his life
-Apocalyptic AU in which they all have to work with each other (I'm imagining that the movie didn't happen in this circumstance, but I'm okay if it did, and apocalypse happens after)

Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) 

There's a lot of stories I really want to see within this fandom. 

One is an epic tale rewriting the whole thing where the white savior trope is less of a thing, Atlantis makes sense as a society, full of political intrigue and history and worldbuilding. honestly this isn't quite my cup of tea, but I also really want explanations where this makes sense, so if you're pulled towards this I would love to read it. 

Second: a couple hundred years in the future Atlantis decides to reveal itself and what that integration looks like. Maybe space is involved! Stargate could be cool because it has another linguist.

Another is just... give me anything with Audrey and Vinny and Sweet and Helga and Mole and all these people, dealing with returning to the world, maybe Milo returning much later. They're immortal, or something close; time is strange and they have adventures and it's hard to adjust to this world but they have to, so they do. They have adventures, they create things; they live their lives, affected by this brush with the fantastical but stuck in a normal-ish world. 

I'd also like to see any of their lives growing up, or Milo's ... uncle? Whoever it was? and his adventures. 

I'm also a linguistics geek so I'd really love to see more realistic language problems, and I'm actually down to read an entire story that's just 'Milo studies things', esp. if you convey the mystery and excitement of a good problem. 

Or Kida's life growing up! What is Atlantis like? Worldbuilding this fascinating place. Or ancient history; what's Kida's mother like? Or life of random Atlantis urchin or why did the Atlantians forget or really... anything that's got at least a touch of magic in this setting.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alabaster (Broken Earth)

I only requested Alabaster, because I love him, and because I feel like we don’t get very much into his head — it’s always mediated through someone else’s point of view. I don’t mind if you ship him with anyone in particular, or if you don’t ship him at all, but I’d prefer the canon ships not be contradicted if you go with a non-canon ship. If you want to do a 5-times sort of fic here that just shows little snippets of events rather than something particularly plotty, that would be cool — e.g. [however many] times Alabaster was truly angry, or how he got some of his rings. 

Equally, you could look at a particular point in Alabaster’s life — his relationship with others like the Stone Eaters or the Guardians, his growth, or even a post-canon conversation between Alabaster and Essun, once they’ve become who they will be.

DNW (these apply to all my prompts): underage sex, high school AUs, incest, non-canonical character death (totally fine with it if the death happens in canon).

The Checquy Files - Daniel O'Malley 
Myfanwy Thomas, Bishop Alrich

For this request, I’d like to see something exploring the relationship between Myfanwy and Alrich. It doesn’t need to be a relationship in the sense of a romantic relationship; what I’m looking for is more their working relationship and awkward friendship. Alrich hints that he worked out quite quickly that the current Myfanwy wasn’t the old one — how does he deal with that? Alternatively, maybe they have to work a case together, with their different temperaments and personal habits leading to a crisis before they actually manage to work together properly. 

If you wanted to go for something a bit cracky, you could put them in a room with an unlikeable operative or target who is vampire-obsessed and keeps on going on about vampires, while Myfanwy and Alrich try not to either a) laugh or b) break cover. 

If you are going the casefic/crack route and you want a cameo from any famous vampires, there’s a good chance I’ll be familiar with your vampire-of-choice.

The Watchmaker of Filigree Street - Natasha Pulley 
Katsu (The Watchmaker of Filigree Street)

Okay so this prompt is a shameless request for Katsu fix-it fic. It might not be the original Katsu — it might be Katsu 2.0 that is scavenged together from some of Katsu's original parts. I would always be happy for Thaniel/Mori in this one, but it’s not a requirement. Maybe Katsu is an unintentional cockblock, showing up when least expected (or required -- if you go with this idea, I'm not looking for Katsu to get involved, as it were). 

If Katsu fix-it is not your bag, maybe something about the weird places Katsu goes, or an adventure Katsu has, either before or during canon, when the humans are off doing human things and Katsu gets some time to go exploring. What would happen if Katsu got into some sort of weird competition with an automaton such as the Mechanical Turk? I could see that going either way -- automaton vs automaton, or automaton Katsu vs human-pretending-to-be-automaton.

Whyborne and Griffin - Jordan L. Hawk 
Griffin Flaherty, Percival Whyborne

This is real \"comfort reading\" for me -- I have read all of the books and short stories, so don't worry about spoiling me. I requested Whyborne and Griffin but I am happy for any of the other characters in the tagset (or in the canon) to show up. I would prefer the canon pairings in this series.

One idea I’d like to see is the journey back from the Necropolis. It’s fade-to-black in canon, and I'd love to see what happened in it, especially because there’s the Whyborne/Christine friendship, and Christine’s budding relationship with Iskander. How frightened are Griffin and Christine that Whyborne might not make it? At what point does Kander work out he’s got nothing to worry about on the Whyborne &amp; Christine front? What does Whyborne say when he’s delirious? Is his magic fully under control, and what happens if it isn’t? 

Another fairly specific prompt — Saul and a “sea cat” manage to have kittens…and suddenly Widdershins has an influx of half-cat half-cephalopods. I imagine Whyborne would worry terribly, but maybe a small purry abomination is just what the Library needs… and the Funeral Home…and Miss Parkhurst’s house…and Niles might be lonely… 

I would equally love a canon-adjacent AU for this one, like soulmates (e.g. one of the many versions of writing on the skin), a Sentinel/Guide AU, or a daemon AU (are Whyborne and Persephone’s daemons “twins” in some way? Was Griffin’s daemon forced to settle by his foster family? What happened to his daemon in the asylum? Do the ketoi have daemons, or do they have something else, like the armoured bears do, and what does that mean for Whyborne's daemon?)

The Grisha Trilogy - Leigh Bardugo 
Alina Starkov, Nikolai Lantsov (Grisha Trilogy)

Okay so I have this head canon that Alina said yes to Nikolai when he asked her to marry him. Either Mal died, or she kept her powers, or everything was the same and she just chose differently. I love the idea of them growing old together (so she would have to lose her powers) but a Stardust thing where she outlives him would be chill.

If you don’t ship them then I’m also super interested in how her friendship with Nikolai and the Grisha plays out in canon. Anything about their interactions would be great! Maybe like a more in detail story about how exactly the holiday visits go (as talked about in the epilogue.)

Romantic would be great but friendship works! I would really love Nikolai to be in it, but it’s more important to me to have Alina, if nothing is really working with Nikolai in the story.

I would prefer it not be smut! I’m certainly down for explicit if that jives, but it’s not something I’m asking for specifically! I’m more about the feels with these two.

The Scorpio Races - Maggie Stiefvater 
Sean Kendrick, Puck Connolly

I would be really interested in reading anything about these two (and their relationship with Corr, because I feel like he is inextricable.) ! Romantic would be my preference but I am down for friendship feels any day of the week. Corr is also optional for me, and if you want to write just Sean or just Puck, that works too!

Some ideas that I thought of:

the Scorpio races the next year. Does Sean race again on a different horse? Does Puck race again? Do they both retire and train others to race? Do they elope to the mainland and forget all about it? (I doubt this last one.) 

I really love alternate point of view fics, so anything about how other people on the island saw their relationship coming together/what they thought about it would be great! (This would be especially interesting to me in canon, like to have it be alternate POV within the context of the actual book. But I’m down for whatever you’re excited about!)

I would love a future fic where everything that happens in Scorpio races is sort of a story that older folks on the island tell, and the races are 50/50 women and men. Either one where Puck and Sean are old and nobody can quite believe they ever did crazy things like the stories say would be good, or something really far in the future where nobody even knew them, or something inbetween! Anything about how their lives unfold on the island is great too.

The Course of Honour - Avoliot 

Prompts: What was Bel's life like before she decided to go straight? I'd love to see some space pirate shenanigans.
I'm fascinated by the system of royal and clan-based obligations and loyalties in this story; I'd love for you to explore it a little more in depth. What does Jainan actually owe his clan, as opposed to what he believes he owes them?
What was Jainan like before he got married? We get little peeks at it in the story, but I'd like to see more. What was his relationship like with Lady Ressid? How did he get into academia and river-running?
From the brief glimpses we get of Thea, it looks like they and Iskat have significant cultural clashes: gender roles, tech, the clan system. How do Theans living on Iskat adapt to these different social mores?
How did the Emperor get where she is? Has Iskat always been this open to gender and racial diversity, or did she have a hand in that?
What do Kiem and co. get up to after the main story ends? I could read as much happy curtainfic as you'd be willing to write.
If you go for fluff, what would Kiem and Jainan's relationship have been like if Kiem had been Jainan's first marriage?
Ships: Kiem/Jainan. Smut would be great if you'd like to write it. No break-ups, please.
DNWs: non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon),  fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon.  No A/B/O or mpreg.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Erasmus (Captive Prince), Jokaste (Captive Prince), Nikandros (Captive Prince), Kallias (Captive Prince)

Prompts: What was life in the Akielon court like before Theomedes' death, with one king on the way out and a coup being planned? Did Nikandros catch on to any of it?
How did Jokaste get to where she is? Did she set out intending to betray the court, or was that the only option left to her? Given that Akielos seems to view women in power in a positive light, is there a reason why she could only ascend by becoming a mistress?
What did Nikandros go through after the coup and before Damen returned to Akielos? Did he truly believe Jokaste and Kastor's propaganda? What was running through his head when he decided to save Damen's pin?
What happens to Jokaste post-canon? She can't really be happy raising a baby and staying out of trouble.
What happens to Kallias and, at a larger scale, to slaves as a whole once Akielos decides to go through with emancipation? Does the process hit any road bumps along the way? How is the lifelong indoctrination of the slaves counteracted?
Do Kallias and Erasmus ever meet again? If so, how does Erasmus reconcile Kallias' decision to save his life with the misery that he underwent as a result? If they don't meet again, I'd love some pining.
Ships: Kallias/Erasmus. Can be happy or angsty, one-sided, manipulative, etc.
DNWs: Master/slave sex portrayed in a positive light, present Erasmus/Torveld, non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon), depictions of slavery that don’t condemn it, fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon. Also, any incest or pedophilia that is more than mentioned. (It's okay for characters who have been abused to reference or remember their abuse.) And no A/B/O or mpreg, please.

The Less Than Epic Adventures of TJ and Amal 
Amal Chakravarthy, TJ Freeman

Prompts: The big question: do they work out or don't they? What are they like when they grow as a couple, with more time than a week to learn about each other?
Do they ever realize their big dreams in medicine and tattooing?
I'd love a little backstory for either of them. How does a young, nerdy, goal-oriented Amal realize that he's gay?
We get a little glimpse of it, but what exactly did TJ do that led to him fleeing the Bay Area?
Or, missing scenes would be good. Conversations, smut, in-character asides.
Ships: TJ/Amal. I HC that they end up staying together, but if you have a good reason to break them up, I'd be down for that too.
DNWs: non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon), fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon. And no A/B/O or mpreg, please.

Monstrous Regiment - Terry Pratchett 

Prompts: I’m mostly interested in backstories and codas: What will Polly do with her new rank and her jar of secrets?
Will Tonker and Lofty get to eat chocolates in that big room after all?
Why did Mal come back, and where is Mal's relationship with Polly going?
If you wanted to write a character study about Wazzer's persistent faith in the face of adversity, I'd be all for it.
I'd love to read about a young, scrappy Jackrum climbing the ranks, his adventures in helping out endless clueless crossdressing recruits, or his retirement as a boisterous grandpa.
If you can do a Pratchett pastiche, that would be great, but it’s not by any means a must.
Ships: Polly/Mal and Lofty/Tonker. Also, I know they aren't in the tag list, but if you fleshed out Froc and the Duchess's age-old romance, I would be forever in your debt.
DNWs: non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon),  fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon. And no A/B/O or mpreg, please.

Peter Darling - Austin Chant 
Peter Pan (Peter Darling), James Hook (Peter Darling), Tinker Bell (Peter Darling), Ernest (Peter Darling)

Prompts: What did Tinker Bell do in between Peter deciding to detransition and his coming back to Neverland?
What was life like for Ernest, being the only real human in a world full of imaginary constructs? How did he figure out the falsity of the Lost Boys?
What do Peter and James do after they get back to James' home? Is it as idyllic as James remembers it being, or do he and Peter go through problems on the way to their happily ever after? I'd love happy curtain fic, but if you want to get a little angsty, that's good too.
How does Peter adjust to being openly himself in the \"real world\"? Does he ever go back to London or confront his family?
Ships: Peter Pan/James Hook.
DNWs: non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon), fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon. And no A/B/O or mpreg, please.

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 

Prompts: Heiro hasn't made an appearance in a while. Has she been made a spy, or married off? Is she still in cahoots with Gen or is she trying to further her own agenda?
How did Eddis come to the decision to destroy her country in order to save her people? She mentions having had dreams of the Sacred Mountain erupting, but did she have to struggle with the idea? Did she rage at the gods, and did they answer her?
Speaking of the gods, how does Moira feel being the intermediary between the rest of the pantheon and these human motes of dust? Does she ever get tired of having to talk Gen down from ledges?
What does Eugenides the god think of Eugenides the man? What would it take for him to drop him?
How did Attolia and Gen handle Attolia's miscarriage? Was it one of those things that even the gods can't prevent, or did the gods make it happen?
We haven't had any of Attolia's perspective in a while. Has she bonded with Eddis at all, maybe built up a correspondence or attended Eddis' wedding? How is she handling ruling at the side of a man who grows ever more powerful? Is she considered inferior to Gen in her own country, or will she be back to terrifying her barons once she's off of bed rest?
Gen himself seems to be growing more and more authoritative and less and less like himself. He can't go out and steal a MacGuffin on his own anymore; he has to rely on allies and intermediaries. He can't even have friends without considering the implications of associating with Sounis, or Kamet's likelihood of being assassinated in court. How does he deal with this loss of his identity?
I'd love anything you wrote from Costis'  straightforward and yet wry point of view: his side of the story during Thick As Thieves, curtain fic with Kamet in Roa, case fic where Gen sends him out on another mission.
And then there's Kamet. I just want him to be happy. How's he holding up in Roa? What kinds of scrolls is he translating? Is he really going to be content as a translator for the rest of his life, or does he get dragged into more adventures?
One thing I especially love about these books is the world-building and in-universe storytelling. I'd love for you to write a myth, or reference the gods in an otherwise mundane story.
Ships: Attolia/Eugenides, Attolia/Costis/Eugenides, Costis/Eugenides (with Attolia's approval), Costis/Kamet. Also, I like the idea of Costis being in a messy polycule where Attolia/Costis/Eugenides and Costis/Kamet are going on at the same time, with everyone's knowledge and consent.
DNWs: non-canonical major character death, explicit sexual abuse/rape (it’s okay if it’s similar to the amount/explicitness that's present in canon), depictions of slavery that don’t condemn it, fridged female characters, bi erasure, and more racism/misogyny/homophobia/transphobia than is present in canon. Also, any incest or pedophilia that is more than mentioned. (It's okay for characters who have been abused to reference or remember their abuse.) And no A/B/O or mpreg, please.

Cory Matthews, Topanga Lawrence-Matthews, Shawn Hunter, Angela Moore

I live for Cory/Shawn/Topanga. It can be platonic, but I'd really prefer romantic. I'd love to see OT3 during any stage of the series or post series. I'd really rather anything post-series to have little to do with GMW. Also, while I love OT3, I still love Angela. She's awesome and deserves her own happy ending. I'd love the 4 of them living their lives together as close friends.

I'm pretty open to a lot here. But I am very partial to Fred/Daphne, Velma/Marcie. Want to give me post-series? Slice of life? Dealing with the monster of the week? Awesome! What the other universe's gang got up to? How the gang copes in the new reality? Roadtrip? Also awesome!

Tell me about growing up as Baudelaire or what V.F.D. used to be like. What were Beatrice and Kit up to before the series (and Kit during the series)? I like slice of life and reasonably happy (though occasionally melancholy) endings

Request 1 by XenomorphLiebe
Alien: Covenant 
David 8 (Alien: Covenant)

I'm a multishipper who ships David/Walter, David/Elizabeth, and Walter/Daniels. I also really like gen. My favourite relationship in Covenant wasn't romantic; it was David's fatherly relationship with his children, the neomorphs. (The scene where David raises his arms and the baby xenomorph raises its arms in response was so cute!) I also thought David and Walter's relationship was really interesting, from the initial curiosity about each other to \"You blow, I'll do the fingering,\" and the kiss, and finally the inevitable fight. There was a lot going on there in a very short amount of time. 

All this to say that if you want to write a David/Walter fic with past David/Elizabeth, then that's cool. If you like David and Walter, but you don't want to write something shippy, then a gen David and Walter fic is cool, but if you do like David/Walter, then that's cool as well. And if you want to write a Walter/Daniels fic where single dad David frolics with the neomorphs, then that's cool too.

As for favourite characters, I both love and hate David with all my heart. (Why did he have to do that to Elizabeth? ;_; He's so evil in Covenant! Where did my morally ambiguous robot go?) Also, I would watch a 2-hour movie that was just the neomorphs and xenomorphs running around. Every time they're on screen, my eyes light up and I start smiling. So, please include the titular aliens in some capacity if you can. I also really liked Elizabeth Shaw in Prometheus, but since she wasn't really in Covenant (i.e., alive and well), she can easily be Dr. Not-Appearing-In-This-Fic. 

DNWs: rape/non-con, major character death, and please avoid excessive harm coming to any neomorphs and xenomorphs (especially from David)


Request 2 by XenomorphLiebe
Daria (Cartoon) 
Daria Morgendorffer (Daria), Jane Lane (Daria)

I liked Daria for its dry wit and the friendship between Jane and Daria. Daria really reminded me of myself when I was in middle and high school; she was a know-it-all loner who used cynicism and apathy as defense mechanisms. I liked how the show wasn't afraid to have a flawed protagonist, one who had real flaws she was at fault for. Most of the time, however, the show ultimately supported Daria's viewpoint.

Femslash is more than acceptable. ;) (But gen is cool too!)

DNWs: rape/non-con, major character death, graphic depictions of violence

Ardeth Bay, Rick O'Connell, Jonathan Carnahan, Evy Carnahan O'Connell

As long as they're no older than thirteen, post-canon future stuff is perfectly fine. Just no sexual content, please!

More details listed in the letter, but requesting the rarepair of Ramza x Ovelia! I can't get into a lot of details here since it's spoilers, but the brief version is: sweet shippy things preferred; if you really don't want to do shippy things, really strong friendship stuff is okay; nothing super sad; and no cheating on other people with each other! And as with my other requests, no sex please!

The Last Samurai - Helen Dewitt 
Ludo (The Last Samurai), Sybilla (The Last Samurai)

My desires in terms of Last Samurai fic are simple: I just want to know what happens to Ludo and/or Sybilla, after the book. Especially Ludo. Who does he end up being, when he grows up? What does he do with his brilliant mind? Hell, what name does he choose to go by? I'd really just love to see something about an older Ludo interacting with the world and the interesting people in it, a sort of extension of the kind of adventures he got up to in the book.

I'd also love to know more about Sybilla, whose character arc I thought ended up getting somewhat short shrift. How does her life change as Ludo grows up? Does she enter the world again, academic or otherwise? How does she continue to deal with her depression?

Sense8 (TV) 

I basically just have a lot of EMOTIONS about the cluster and the experience of being sensate, and would love a fic exploring that. What exactly does it mean, to be part of a cluster? Our main cluster seems to have had a somewhat unique/traumatic experience of being “born,” how does that make their take on being sensate different? The show did a pretty good job visually showing it, but I'm super fascinated by what the interiority of the experience is like. The members of the cluster seemed to feel a pretty instant empathy and understanding of each other, what's that like? By now they must know each other better, what was that process like, learning all the mundane stuff about each other in non-life or death situations? How does being a sensate influence their relationships with the other people in their life? What happens when, say, Will tells Diego or Lito finally tells Hernando and Dani (on the way to rescue Wolfgang perhaps)? I know Season 2 ended on a bit of a cliffhanger, but feel free to just jump ahead to some nebulous future where everything’s resolved if you want. You by no means have to answer all or even any of these specific questions, they’re just guides for the kind of thing I’m interested in here.

I picked Any characters here, so go wild. I'm most interested in the main cluster, but I'm overall fascinated by the whole sensate experience and what it means for any given character's relationships and experience of the world. Any fic exploring that would be great. Shipwise, I'm into all the canon pairings and basically any permutation of the members of the cluster.

17776: What Football Will Look Like in the Future - Jon Bois 

I am so utterly FASCINATED by the improbable and amazing and weird utopia Jon Bois has built with 17776. It’s a world that seems to be positively teeming with stories, and I’m wildly interested in reading about any and all of them. I do not actually care about football qua football; I like the country and centuries-spanning version of the game Jon Bois has extrapolated here, but you don’t have to make it the focus of anything you write. What I’d love to know more about are those first few decades after humanity realizes they can no longer die. Or, heck, who first realizes people have stopped dying, and how do they approach that mystery? How do other parts of the world deal with immortality, what games do they play? I know Jon Bois thinks that humanity is alone in this universe, and won’t be able to overcome the practical roadblocks to long-range space travel, but what if they did? What if humanity’s not alone? Who are the kinds of people who’d fling themselves out into the big, wide dark of space, with no expectation of returning, and eternity stretching out in front of them? What other bits of electronics or AI have gained their own sentience or significance, and who do they talk to?

Honestly, I’d be thrilled with you exploring just about any nook or cranny of this fascinating universe. I’d only ask that you maintain the source’s absurd yet optimistic and loving tone. Bittersweet and even a little elegiac is fine, I just don’t want anything grim or dark here. The world we’re living in right now has plenty of that. Also, do not feel the need to try any wild format/coding stuff the way Bois did if you don’t want to. A vanilla text story is more than enough for me.

Moonlight (2016) 
Chiron (Moonlight), Kevin (Moonlight)

Just give me Chiron and Kevin’s happy ending. The world hasn’t been kind to them, but I want to believe in the possibility of it being kinder, of them being tender and kind with one another, after everything. I want to believe that they can build a life together, even if it’s not the kind of life they or anyone else would have expected. Trevante Rhodes said, “I like to think they’re together, walking in Central Park hand-in-hand when they’re 90 years old,” and yeah, that’s what I hope for them too. So I’d love a story about how they get there, or how they start that journey.

Another possible prompt, this one from something Andre Holland (who plays Kevin) said: “I have this image of them walking along with Kevin’s son and teaching him, either overtly or experientially, about what masculinity is and what it means to be a man, in all the variations that are possible. That, to me, is the magic of it, that there’s a young boy in the world who will grow up with a different idea of masculinity than either of them had.”

Jack Whitehall is a menace, and Freddie's had enough of his bullshit.

An assignation in one of their hotel rooms during their US tour? Your call. Doesn't need to be smut (although obviously I'm not opposed), but just something where Freddie finally gets the better of Jack.

Aitor is a tempermental man-mountain of sex and charisma. Hugo Sánchez is a sweet, naive, deeply odd creature. I want them to smash their faces together and maybe get married. Aitor comes back to Nuevo Toledo and Suetercito catches his eye! Sure, it's absurd, but so is literally everything about this show. And I think the combination of Aitor's brash egotism and Hugo Sánchez's quiet kindness would work surprisingly well together! Feel free to bring in other characters... I'm sure Chava would be initially upset (Aitor is his best bro, güey!) but eventually supportive in his Chava way, and that would be hilarious.

Legend of the Five Rings (LCG) 
Bayushi Kachiko (L5R LCG), Doji Hotaru (L5R LCG)

I've been playing L5R on and off since AEG's CCG's Scorpion Clan Coup, but if you're new to this setting, welcome! I'm really stoked for the reboot, and I really love that they've genderswapped AEG's Doji Hoturi to a woman (Doji Hotaru) and taken that to one possible logical consequence, a lesbian romance between seductress Bayushi Kachiko and elegant Crane Clan Champion Doji Hotaru.

If you're new to L5R and this stokes your curiosity, all the L5R (LCG) canon can be found here:
https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game/
There are under a dozen short stories at the time I write this and it took me about an hour to read them all.  For this pairing in particular, the most relevant stories are \"Her Father's Daughter\" and \"The World, a Stage\" (under Core Set Fiction); you could pretty much write fic based on those alone.  (I can't guarantee that more fic about these particular characters won't come out, though.)

I ship these two like burning and would adore f/f, although it need not be explicit. Rokugan is a world of high drama and, in particular, given the setting, I am explicitly okay with a tragic ending, since loyalty to a lover inherently conflicts with loyalty to one's lord or emperor, and this pairing involves an extramarital affair on top of that. That being said, don't feel obliged to go to the tragedy place--I'd equally enjoy a happy-for-now or happily-ever-after ending for these two.

Prompts:
- How did Kachiko and Hotaru meet and fall in love?
- How much is Kachiko manipulating her lover, and how much does Bayushi Shoju (if you want to bring him in) know about what's going on?
- Does Hotaru have tricks of her own up her sleeve? Is she countermanipulating Kachiko? I mean, she is the Crane Champion, and a Doji at that.
- For the crack version, you could do bodyswap smut.
- Or the Discord chat version of them flirting.

Note: Visual reference of Hotaru can be found in a portrait in \"Her Father's Daughter\" [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/12/1d/121dfe67-eed4-401a-be54-fb1c6e35c169/her_fathers_daughter.pdf]; I don't believe Kachiko yet has a card or illustration in the LCG so these cards from the CCG are possibilities for visual reference: [http://imperialassembly.com/oracle/#hashid=5b38fca66c0791037386dd9ad596513b,#page=1] (I'm fondest of the Matt Wilson illustrations, but the Steve Argyle one is also lovely.)

Steve Jackson's Sorcery! - Steve Jackson 

Requested: Any

Possibilities from the tagset:
The Adventurer (Sorcery!)
The Archmage of Mampang (Sorcery!)
Flanker (Sorcery!)
Serpent of Time (Sorcery!)

I imprinted on this Fighting Fantasy gamebook series as a kid, and they remain some of my favorites even today. If you want to try a fanwork for this in IF or gamebook format, that would be really cool, but I would be equally happy with regular/static fic. (I know from experience that IF/gamebooks are time-consuming to write!)

Second person would feel most natural to me given the source canon if you're doing the Adventurer as a POV, but I'm happy to read first or third if that works better for you.

Also, feel free to bring in anyone, I mean anyone, from the series. I loved it all.

If you're using this as an emergency fandom and only have access to one of the books, The Adventurer works for any of the four books and is probably the easiest choice. You get the most material on the Archmage in The Crown of Kings when the PC confronts him, but there's some backstory on him in the intro material for each book so you could use that as a basis. Flanker is a minor character from The Shamutanti Hills and Kharé. The Serpent of Time appears in The Seven Serpents.

Alternately, feel free to do worldbuilding or generalized metafiction based on the gamebook(s), especially about games/game design, rather than focusing on a character or characters, if that speaks to you.

The Adventurer
- Five ways the Adventurer came to a bad end before getting to confront the Archmage of Mampang.
- What if the Archmage corrupts the Adventurer and they turn against Analand?
- Metafiction in which the Adventurer realizes that they're a gamebook character--what happens next?
- What if ZED sent the Adventurer back even further in time and they changed the history of the entire series?
- The Adventurer's diary, perhaps discovered centuries later by archaeologists or historians? Bonus points if it's hilariously misinterpreted, with footnotes.

The Archmage of Mampang
- The Archmage dealing with internal shenanigans at Mampang. The Crown of Kings made it sound pretty disorganized!
- What is the Archmage up to while the Adventurer progresses? Maybe in the form of spy reports that he receives, whether from the Serpents or other servants.
- How did the Archmage dispose of former Adventurers? After all, you can play the gamebook(s) over and over...
- What happens if the Archmage gets a hold of the Analander Spell Book? Surely he would have uses of his own for ZED...
- The Archmage's backstory and how he rose to power. What does his mom think of his career choice? This can be as silly or as serious as you want.

Flanker
- Post-series fic in which Flanker and the Adventurer become adventuring buddies!
- What is Flanker's backstory? How did he get into a life of assassination?
- Who are some of Flanker's other friends? He seems an honorable sort as assassins go, and it seems likely that he's made other contacts in the region.
- Flanker out for a night drinking, maybe hanging out with other assassins and getting into philosophical arguments (or darts matches)?
- Flanker on a completely different assassination mission in the region.

Serpent of Time
- The Serpent's bitter, bitter diary of its trials and tribulations trying to bring the Adventurer (or multiple Adventurers) to heel.
- What kinds of errands does the Serpent get up to when it's not trying to stop an Adventurer?
- What the Serpent does on its vacations. Feel free to get as silly/cracky as you want.
- The Serpent and its brethren have many guises--feel free to explore any of them, or make up your own.
- What happens if the Serpent survives a defeat and plots revenge?

Vorkosigan Saga - Lois McMaster Bujold 
Aral Vorkosigan, Ges Vorrutyer

I ship these two like burning, and am fascinated how one fell into the depths of villainy and the other became a stronger, better man. You could take this in so many different directions--I'd be equally pleased either by something that stuck very closely to canon or canon-divergence AU or a total crack AU (a/b/o, high school AU, barista AU, the sky's the limit).

- I've always loved the hints that we get of Aral as an artist. Anything exploring Aral drawing Ges, or what Ges thinks of the whole endeavor, would be great--you could make this as fluffy or as serious as you care to.
- An exploration of their different military leadership styles--I was a little wistful that Bujold didn't get more into that after dropping that note about how Ges is a master of defensive strategy.
- If you're into darkfic, canon-divergence AU in which Ges drags Aral down into corruption with him. You have my blanket permission to go as dark as you want with this so long as you don't hit a DNW.
- For something less dark, canon-divergence AU in which Aral redeems Ges and they remain friends and/or lovers and/or comrades.
- On a crack note, Barrayaran high school AU prom night.

Please see letter for additional details.

I'd love to see something with Breq + any (or all!) of the other characters that explores their relationship(s). In particular, I'm interested in how Breq reacts to being treated like a person by the others, instead of a ship.

The House is an incredibly unique and creepy place, and while there's tons of story in the various locations, there's a lot less about the day-to-day nature of traveling around inside a giant kinetopede through the dark. I'd love something slice-of-life-y aboard the kinetopede, with any or all of these characters, exploring what life is like in between the cities. (I'm aware that Fiona and Abbas can't technically be on the ship at the same time as they're both guard captains; I leave it to you whether you want to use only one of them, or have a reason for them both to be there.)

Basically these guys get up to all kinds of crazy shenanigans, and I just want more of Khat being Khat and Sagai being fondly exasperated by him. I'm also interested in Khat's history and relationship with the krismen - it's touched on briefly in the books, but I feel like the krismen aren't the type to accept \"go pound sand\" for an answer.

Moon being an idiot, or alternatively, Moon being the formerly feral badass who saves everyone's scales. Malachite and Pearl's adventures as terrifying BFFs. Stone wondering (yet again) why he bothered to reproduce. Malachite being baffled by Moon. Any combination of these four characters. 

Other characters welcome if desired, but I'd prefer the primary focus to be on some or all of the four requested!

Final Fantasy VI 
Edgar Roni Figaro (FFVI), Locke Cole (FFVI)

Edgar was my first fictional crush. I was 12, he was handsome and charming and had a chainsaw. Good times. This is definitely one of those \"give me ANYTHING, I just want more fic!\" requests, but here are some ideas:

The early days of the Returners -- how Edgar and Locke met and started working together, and how they each got involved in the first place
Small lost scenes in-game where they're reflecting on how out of control everything has gotten... opposing the empire is one thing, but Goddess Statues and Kefka's whole... Kefka... is something else.
I ship it, and really like one-sided Edgar -&gt; Locke (Edgar's one of those \"ladies' man\" types where I start thinking that maybe he's being overly performative to hide his true preferences.) Maybe they had a friends with benefits thing that Locke's feelings for Celes complicate. Maybe Edgar's just got a lot of feelings he doesn't want to let slip. Maybe Celes figures it out, or someone else does.

Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator

Amanda thinks Val is awesome, and it's adorable. Anything about them growing close post-game -- whether it's a scenario where their dads are dating or not. Val canonically mentions having a girlfriend, but we don't really know how serious it is, so -- Val/Amanda is a definite possibility that I am interested in. 

In a story where their dads are together, what kinds of wacky family hijinks would they get up to? What would Small family bonding even look like? Do they hunt cryptids together, or does Val think her dad is crazy? I imagine Amanda, with her love of supernatural trucker shows, would be into it.

I'd really love some post-game travels.

Can Link show her the insides of the shrines now? Does she have any lingering guilt over the fate of Hyrule? I ship Link/Zelda but also like them in a deep but platonic relationship, so go either way with that. (I also kinda ship Link/Sidon and Zelda/Urbosa, if you want any background ships.)

Or maybe they have to help Purah and/or Robbie with some kind of crazy experiemnt -- I'm sure Zelda would love to spend time with both of them. How dangerous is post-game Hyrule? Are there still Lynels and Hinoxes out there to give them some trouble? Zelda learning how to fight from Link could also be fun.

Bill Denbrough (It - King), Eddie Kaspbrak (It - King), Mike Hanlon (It - King), Stanley Uris (It - King)

(Character requests are \"or\", not \"and\". They are my favourites, but I'd love if you could write about the rest of the main seven, too!)

DNWs: rape/noncon, a/b/o, bodily fluids, underage sex, genderswap, bodyswap, PWP, power imbalances (e.g. teacher/student), first person POV, non-canonical character death, pregnancy/mpreg, kidfic, curtainfic/pure fluff/schmoop, soulmate AU, character bashing, crossovers
* Please don't write about or mention the sex scene with Beverly and the others in the sewers as kids!

Prompts:
* How do they/the main seven deal with the aftermath of facing It the first time? When does the forgetting begin, and the leaving? How does their lack of trauma recovery manifest into their teenage and adulthood years? What does the body remember? What do they dream of? And how did they become who they are 27 years later?
* Bill/Mike: If years and years later Bill ever does somehow return to Derry, and if Mike'll still be there, as he's always been—what would that look like? They both had to bear an awful weight—Bill as the leader, Mike as the keeper of Derry—so I've always liked the idea of them somehow finding relief/peace together in the end, too.
* Explorations of the relationships between any of the main seven, platonic or romantic! Other dynamics I like include Bill/Richie, Richie/Eddie, Bill/Stan, Richie/Stan, and Bev/Richie, but these are just suggestions—I don't mind which ones you ultimately choose to write, or even if you go ot7.
* Please don't write an AU where It never happened, because it’s such a fundamental part of their story for me. If you want to find a way to pull in an alternate universe idea or trope of some sort, it’s fine with me as long as you can keep in this part of the story/how it’s affected by the change.

Prompts:
* Fic that deals with the aftermath: Zack still—after everything—living with the fact that his mother's dying; Kimberly having to apologize for what she did (and actually tell the others about it) and trying to become a better person (with help from the others, maybe); Billy recovering from the fact that he literally died; Trini dealing(/reconciling?) with her family; Jason figuring out his identity outside of football/being Angel Grove's golden boy.
* How would attractions among each other affect their newfound dynamic? I particularly like Kimberly/Trini, Jason/Billy, Jason/Zack, and ot5, but please don't write 4 people in 2 relationships + 1 person out (e.g. Kimberly/Trini + Jason/Billy + Zack).
* What sort of casual superpowered shenanigans do they get up to, now that Rita's gone and they’re still the Power Rangers?
* Regardless of the risks that come with the superhero title, I'd really like fic that lets them examine why, exactly, they're so eager to throw their lives away, and if they can come to a place where they see themselves and their futures as worth protecting, too.
* AUs/tropes: Road trips/hitchhikers, magic/magical realism, post-apocalypse, time travel/loops, thieves, non-Power Ranger superheroes, music bands, etc... In any given universe: how do they meet, and how do they come together? And how do they stay together?

Prompts:
* Seo/Kashima: The singing lessons—why, exactly, does Seo put up with them? Kashima can make any girl swoon—so what’s up with Seo? I just love the idea of things usually coming easy for Kashima, but not so with Seo—except isn’t Kashima still getting what she wants from her, in a way? (AUs: future fic? Fake dating? Enemies to lovers? Rivals? Roommates?)
* Sakura/Seo: How does someone like Seo Yuzuki become best friends with Sakura Chiyo, anyway? Or everyday high school shenanigans, future fic, AUs, etc...
* I love Sakura/Nozaki together, but I also love the idea of them not being together, and it’s that bittersweet idea that I always want to see more of, rather than the love-story-played-straight. Think Sakura never telling Nozaki her true feelings, or both of them knowing but never stating it aloud, or Sakura coming to terms with the unrequited nature of her love, etc. And, again—future fic: Where will they go, from here? And will they still be in each other's lives?
* Gen shenanigans between any of these characters or the rest of the group, in canon setting or AU, would also be lovely, but these 3 specific romantic pairings I have listed are the only ones I would like to see explored in whatever you may choose to write for me (with the exception of Nozaki/Sakura/Mikoshiba, who I didn't have space to request, but if you love them too—go for it).

Prompts:
* Kuwei: Kuwei’s crush on Jesper has always been interesting to me. Maybe even his crush on all of them. I’d love anything that explores his character—backstory, perspective on the events of the books, interactions with the rest of the gang (or even just observations of them), etc.
* Kuwei/Jesper/Wylan: Jesper/Wylan is such a stable, sure relationship; how would Kuwei—who hasn't been on the same death-defying escapades with the rest of them—influence their dynamic?
* Jesper &amp; Kaz: How did their first meeting go? What about past jobs? How did Jesper fall all the way down out of his starry-eyed farm-boy-coming-to-university life and then work his way up to Kaz's side in the Dregs? I can see Jesper being in unrequited love with Kaz, but you don't have to go that far if you don't want to.
* Future fic: How are they all healing, and how are they rebuilding? Though they aren’t all together anymore, I’d love to read about the little connections between them from time to time. Maybe even a reunion fic, and how it would happen; bonus points if it's not exactly in the most planned or the safest of circumstances (Inej did say she planned to bring down the scum of Ketterdam, did she not?).
* AUs: modern thieves, superpowers, post-apocalypse, etc... Anything about this group coming together, and all the conflicts and shenanigans that ensue! (Please don't choose one that's completely mundane, like coffee shops.)
* Disclaimer that I've never read the Grisha trilogy, if that affects your writing plans at all!

Pikmin (Video Game) 
Man-at-legs (Pikmin)

DNW: anything sexual, gore

There's so many questions raised when you think about this Pikmin 2 boss, especially in terms of its Piklopedia entry.  Man-at-legs is a machine-spider hybrid where the spider apparently has no natural enemies and might be peaceful, but the machine is a metal armor with a rapid-fire laser cannon.  Who thought that was a good idea?  How does a spider's and a machine's minds and bodies work together?  Can I disable the canon and give the spider a hug?  Or would the machine find some other way to kill me?  And what's the history of the rusted out Subterranean Complex it lives in?

I'm mostly interested in world-building from canon, but for this particular critter, I wouldn't mind an AU setting that lets the spider and machine talk.

Puggsy (Video Game) 

DNW: anything sexual, gore, Puggsy turned into a villain/bad guy

This is a huge nostalgia game for me, mostly in the amount of silliness you can get up to with its Genesis-era item physics.  Anything building off the game would make me happy.  Darkskull Forest and Darkblade Castle would make for some interesting stories; most areas would, but those two are my particular favorites.  Some background on Puggsy himself would be interesting, since he's a space-traveler but we don't know what he actually does besides getting stranded on this one planet.

I also nominated Halitosis the Dragon because he's a huge fire-breathing dragon that tip-toes around with a big grin on his face; he's a good representation of what's fun about the game.  And the final boss, Emperor Raccoon... what's he want Puggsy's spaceship for?  He rules over an anachronistic island with a strange blend of cultures.  How does that work out?  I'll be happy with stories on any of the three.

Warriors of the Eternal Sun (Video Game) 
Marmillian (Warriors of the Eternal Sun), Cat Owner (Warriors of the Eternal Sun)

DNW: anything sexual, gore

This setting is fascinating to me: trapped in an enclosed valley of an alien world under a red sun that never moves, the people are slowly going crazy while they try to figure out what's going on.  I'd like to see more of what goes on in the castle while the player's party is out trying to find allies.  So I picked two people who would have a good view on it: the scholar who stays in his tower and a generic townsperson who spends the whole game trying to find their cat.  Including the cat would be a good bonus (Marmillian does mention finding it, but the cat is never returned to its owner in-game).

Or maybe, what if the adventuring party fails to come back?  Can these two go out and save the day?  Maybe they'll need help from the cat; I hear cats in Dungeons and Dragons can be pretty dangerous.  Since this game is based off the original D&amp;D, feel free to use that as a resource or inspiration.

琅琊榜 | Nirvana in Fire (TV) 
Xiao Jing Rui

I love almost all of the characters in NiF so feel free to include as many as you like in your story, but  after much deliberation, I decided that what I really wanted for this canon was a Jingrui-centric piece. His adventures in Da Yu, how he deals with the aftermath of his birthday party, his thoughts on and feelings for MCS, his feelings about his multiple families, his friendship with Yujin--go nuts! I ship both Jingrui/MCS and Jingrui/Yujin if you wish to go the shipping route, but please don't pair him with anyone else. I don't mind angst and sadness but I would prefer if the story ended on a happy or hopeful note.

DNWs: 

Please no deathfic, grimdark, scat, inter-generational (incest between people of different generations) or sibling incest,  animal death and torture, bestiality,  Jingrui shipped with someone else other than Yujin or MCS, threesome/poly, AUs (especially mundane/modern AUs), first-person POV, rape/noncon, sexual abuse of children or children in sexual situations, cannibalism, necrophilia

The Good Place (TV) 
Janet (The Good Place), Jianyu Li | Jason Mendoza

I love them so much and ship them so hard! I know the canon isn't free from vaguely sinister undertones, but I would prefer a sweet, happy, kooky fic featuring the two of them being their sweet, happy, kooky selves with each other. Maybe about how the adventures they have or they find each other again in one of the failed attempts? I would prefer this fic to be romantic, but porn is not necessary. In canon, there is supposed to be a limitless number of Janets, both good a bad, but while I would love to read about other Janets, please make our!Janet (TM) (plus Jason) the focus of the fic.

&nbsp;

DNWs: 

Please no onscreen visceral torture,  grimdark, scat, incest, animal death and torture, evil!Janet (i.e., our!Janet being evil, as opposed to Bad Place Janet), evil!Jason (Jason might be in the Bad Place but, for me, it’s more that he did unthinkingly did bad things rather than being actually evil. Maybe I should just say no evil humans), either ending up with someone else, threesome/poly, bestiality, first-person POV, rape/noncon, sexual abuse of children or children in sexual situations, cannibalism, necrophilia, AUs, reincarnation fic, fic ending with any of the protagonists ending up in the Real Bad Place

Drag-On Dragoon | Drakengard (2003) 
Caim (Drakengard), Red Angel (Drakengard)

I liked Square Enix. I like Dragons. I got Drakengard and didn’t regret it at all. The story is refreshingly out of there, the music fittingly mad and the main characters were, erm, likeable doesn’t exactly capture it. Given my favorite characters, the first game is my favorite, it simply had more screen time for them and had more endings in which they survived, at least till they left the screen, and I certainly consider any end they survived in reasonable shape as a happy ending. Who cares about the world getting saved when Caim and Red Dragon aren’t there to enjoy it. I liked how we basically saw Caim’s thoughts only through his actions and Red Dragon reacting to his “voice”. And Red Dragon, she was just so, erm, sweet doesn’t really fit here either. They are so great together, starting out as reluctant allies and then slowly getting to know each other and growing closer together. The pat on her snout is one of my favorite scenes.

    So some possibilities for inspiration:
Maybe there's a little episode on how they got closer, he hated dragons and she didn't like humans at the beginning after all and in the end – the first anyway – there's talk about love. Maybe some commiserating and healing after Inuart's attack. Maybe they managed to dodge in the fifth ending.
Experimentation gone awry or not gone awry (yes, I was thinking of the naughty kind. *nudge, nudge, wink, wink*)
Or maybe just a fluffy Happy End for these two – Happy End for the rest of the world not required.

    And just because I prefer them to be more more than less whole at the end, doesn't mean I didn't like Drakengard for it's dark and somewhat out of it atmosphere. So everything needn't necessarily be smiles and sunshine.

    Do want: Happy End

Man from Atlantis 
Mark Harris (Man from Atlantis), Elizabeth Merrill (Man from Atlantis)

The first time I was told about this series, I didn’t even know its name. A school mate of mine tried to sell it to me as a sequel to a movie I had just seen. Turned out it was a series in its own right, no connection to my movie and fortunately the prophesied death not happening either. It took many years till I got to see the series again after the first time, many things certainly weren’t like had remembered – turns out Elizabeth wasn’t actually in the last episode, I’d have sworn she was all being nervous for Mark. But I certainly remember pivotal things, like Schubert being obsessed with Mark and Elizabeth saving Mark in that desert. The first four episodes are my favorites, although I do have both of Warner’s DVD sets to complete the series.

    I requested Mark, because I like fish out of the water, and I liked him in the water, too. The second character I’m requesting is Elizabeth, she’s the reason I like the first four movie/episodes better. She got to be more of a scientist and be part of the action, instead of being mostly around as a disbelieving foil to Mark’s knowledge about the weird stuff going on underwater.

    The land is vast and the sea even vaster, I’m sure so are the possible the stories which could surface for this fandom. Mark and Elizabeth going on another quest for the Man from Atlantis’ origins? Something more about the time at the army before the foundation and how Mark learns to fit in on land? Elizabeth having to save Mark once again? Or something more sizzling, and I’m not talking about black smokers here. Although and adventure involving black smokers would be interesting, too.

Tokkei Winspector | Special Rescue Police Winspector 
Walter (Winspector), Kagawa Ryoma (Winspector), Fujino Junko (Winspector), Bikel (Winspector)

Winspector was another eye-opener, my first real life action suit up series. I think it’s also the only one that made it to my country directly from Japan and not via the USA like Power Rangers. Many good childhood memories. I like Fire working till he’s more than less fried by his suit, Junko not needing a suit to hunt down criminalsand the two robots enthusiastically partaking in humanity in between fighting evil scientists, evil aliens and other evil things. And the both robots were so adorably human while still being robots.

    It was rather refreshing and eye-opening to see the robots as, well, just normal “humans”. They were somehow accepted and cheered on by the humans, especially the children. And Winspector never giving up and continuing to fight for the good in the people and the responsible use of science for the good of humanity. And so sparkly while still-being so down to Earth and real-life, for a given value of real-life, one that surprisingly includes giant birds and alien creatures. Anyway, before seeing the series again I mostly remembered it for Fire fryage.

    So, maybe Fire will get to save the day again, needing some saving of himself afterwards. Or maybe Junko gets to try on the suit. Would that even work? There’s also that ending suspiciously looking like a happy day off for the team. What did Junko get up to while the others rode bicycles and broke Flipper machines? She’s there on the beach, with the flowers finally blooming. Or how did that apparent day off play out for Biker and Walter? Biker had his heart broken and Walter is beloved by all children, are they beloved by their other two team mates as well?

Tenkuu no Escaflowne | The Vision of Escaflowne 
Van Fanel, Kanzaki Hitomi

The Vision of Escaflowne is one of my favorite anime series and one of the first series I imported from the US and Japan. Such a beautiful animation and a nicely tight and evenly paced story. The soundtrack is great and there's a dragon mecha - two things I love for the price of one. It also helped that Nobuteru Yuuki who also had is hands in the design of my first OVA Record of Lodoss War – not requested – had his hands in this one as well. 

    I requested Hitomi and Van, because they are my favorite characters. I like the fish out of the water experience of Hitomi and Van has wings, I squeed so much when saw that episode. Both of them had still had to some growing up to during the course of the series and they certainly didn't always make the right choice. But in general they were good at what they did and tried to make things better.

    As for some prompt ideas. Wings are always a good start (Please don't give Hitomi a pair). So maybe a difficult flight through a storm for the the of them. Or having to hunker down under Van's pair for some warmth sharing - which could certainly lead to more, if you want to, preferably after both of them became adults. Or a reunion either on Earth or on Gaia. Maybe Hitomi showing Van the wonders of her world.

Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi | Spirited Away 
Haku | Nigihayami Kohakunushi, Ogino Chihiro

This was the first Ghibli movie I saw on the big screen, and it is such a great movie. The story is so interesting and the scenery so colorful and fantastic with so many things to see. It also has dragon which always a big big plus.

My two favorite characters are Haku and Chihiro. Who had connection from before the beginning, but still found each other with out. I liked how Chihiro, after she got over the first shock of being in this fantastical world, bravely faced whatever lay ahead of her and tried to do the best she could till she succeeded. I also liked how Haku still helped her even when Yubaba had got so much control over him by taking his name.

So, for some ideas to get the juices started. How about a reunion of these two later on for further adventures, or just a further adventure either in the human world or in the world of the bathhouse. Things probably changed a lot since Haku was last in our world. Has even been out among the mortals before his stream was cut off? Or a travel to see what else is along the train tracks.
If you'd like to go with something on the smuttier side, please set it when both of them are adults. Haku is very welcome to stay in his dragon-form. Is it possible to join the high mile club on a dragon? And if the dragon participates, does he have enough attention left not to crash them?

A Place Called Winter - Patrick Gale 
Harry Cane (A Place Called Winter), Ursula | Little Bear (A Place Called Winter)

For a list of general likes and an easy-to-read format, please see my letter.

I appreciate the direction the ending of the novel took with Harry and Paul, but what happened to Ursula broke my heart. I'd like a happy ending for Ursula if at all possible, even if you have to stretch realism a little in order to make it happen.

Ideas:

- Somehow, Ursula joins Harry on his farm near Winter. Things fall into place for both of them, and they're able to find comfort, healing, and happiness. It's up to you whether this happens through canon divergence (such as a situation where Ursula does not attempt suicide, and the two of them are later released) or future scenarios (postcanon, Ursula is later released, or escapes somehow).

- Slice-of-life development of Harry and Ursula's friendship during their time at the asylum. I loved the scenes that we had with them in the novel, and I'd like more along the same lines.

- Reincarnation AU; Harry and Ursula meet again in another life, in a more modern time, and have another chance to become friends. Paul can come too. :) If you do this one, please keep the canon genders/sexualities.

Please Do Not Include:

-Unrequested AUs/Crossovers

Valiant Hearts: The Great War (Video Game) 

For a list of general likes and an easy-to-read format, please see my letter.

Requested characters: Any from the tagset

I'd love literally anything for this canon. Feel free to include characters who aren't in the tagset, such as Walt or Marie or Margaret. I'm also familiar with the Dogs of War comic, and would be happy to receive something set during that time if you're interested. Fic set at any time, including postcanon, would be equally welcome. \"Emile lives!\" AU would be lovely if you feel like writing something canon-divergent. 

Ideas:

Prompts:

- The summer before the war. Karl coming to work on Emile's farm, meeting Marie, falling in love. Karl and Marie's romance would be great; exploring Karl's developing friendship and familial relationship with Emile would also be great. Slice-of-life family goodness.

- Snapshots of moments during any of the times that Anna nursed Karl; their developing friendship, growing closer over time. (Possibly with a side of \"We have to stop meeting like this\" ;p )

- Backstory for Freddie, exploring his relationship with Margaret. Happier times, though not without conflict. Alternately, postcanon fic with Freddie - fighting alongside his brother, surviving the war, what happens next? Do he and Anna stay friends?

- Letters home: epistolary option, similar to what we see in the game, set during or after canon; letters exchanged between the various characters, or sent abroad in Freddie's case. Diary entries would also be wonderful.

There are a lot of bits of story that we've received hints about, but haven't been explored, and I'd love to read something related to that, even if it will inevitably be jossed by canon eventually. Feel free to go forward in the timeline, if you want to explore/invent the story after our current canon point. Also, if you only want to focus on one of the requested characters, that's okay!

Ideas:

- Sakari and Veeti reunion. When Sakari and Mika return, I expect that Veeti will have quite the reaction to finally seeing the brother that he had thought was dead. Please show me some of that. ;) (Extra love if there's some \"I'm never going to let you out of my sight again\" feeling going on there.)

- Sakari's disappearance - the circumstances, the emotional fallout back in Lapland, Veeti being completely broken up over it and trying (and failing) to deal with it.

- Cozy precanon slice-of-life: Cute brotherly interaction between Sakari and Veeti while they were growing up. (If Sakari's \"death\" hit Veeti so hard, they must have gotten along very well, right?)

While I've always been very very interested in their history and pre-show dynamic, I think I would prefer something set either during the show or after the show if possible. Just something that kind of delves into the complicated dynamic they had, and their feelings about one another and the importance of their friendship within the larger group.

Mean Girls (2004) 
Regina George, Janis Ian

I've always be super interested in their shared history that was alluded to in the movie, and what could have possibly gone down between them (I've personally always assumed there was an explored attraction there). But even moreso, I've always been super interested in the possibility of them reconnecting after the movie, after Regina's fall from grace/redemption.

Nikita (TV 2010) 
Nikita Mears, Alexandra Udinov

I love these characters and their relationship so much, I'd probably love anything someone could write about them. There's so much history and angst and hurt and love and betrayal and loyalty there; any exploration of any of that would be amazing. 

Some more thoughts, likes and possible ideas are expanded on in my letter.

Greek (TV) 
Casey Cartwright, Rusty Cartwright

Casey and Rusty were always the heart of the show to me, and the development of their relationship throughout the series was definitely my favorite part, so I would probably love to read just about anything about it/them; pre-show, post-show, something during, anything.

Le Comte de Monte-Cristo | Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas 
Eugénie Danglars (Le Comte de Monte-Cristo - Dumas), Louise d'Armilly (Le Comte de Monte-Cristo - Dumas)

It makes me happy that there’s a canon (or as strongly implied as you can get in the 19th century) F/F couple and that they get a happy ending. I'd like anything with Eugénie and Louise being happy together. Maybe something set after the novel, where Eugénie has the brilliant musical career that she dreamed of? Or if you prefer to write something set during the novel, I get the impression that they were pretty much ignored by Eugénie's parents and could spend time together with no one asking too many questions. Perhaps a scene of them snatching kisses (or more) over their music? Or how did they first realize or confess their love to each other? It’s mentioned that Eugénie is a poet, among her other talents. Did she court Louise in poetry?

I love opera and classical music, so I would be interested to read anything to do with their music. I am also intrigued by the suggestion in the chapter \"The Road for Belgium\" that this wasn't the first time Eugénie has tried cross-dressing.

Dragaera - Steven Brust 
Aerich (Dragaera), Khaavren, Pel (Dragaera), Tazendra

The Phoenix Guards and Five Hundred Years After are my favorite of the Khaavren books (and possibly my favorite of the Dragaera books). They’re just so much fun! I really enjoy these characters’ friendship and banter and their loyalty to each other and the way they work together. (Oh, and if you want to write something in Paarfi's style, feel free! But please don't feel obligated if you're not comfortable with the style.)

“More of the sort of thing that there is in canon” is probably a frustratingly vague prompt, but . . . more adventures in the Phoenix Guards together, more court intrigue, more drinking and fighting and magic? Dueling, scheming, snark, swashbuckling, flirting, loyalty, conflicts of honor and duty . . . anything in the spirit of canon will make me happy! (Please see letter for more prompts.)

The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore (2011) 

I love the world of this little film, and I would be happy with anything that matches the tone of the original.  I love its whimsy and sense of wonder. It's about the beauty and joy of reading, and it honestly makes me tear up.

I really just want more about this world, so I'd be happy to see whatever you come up with. But if you want specific prompts: Scenes from Morris's life with the books? Or what's the story of the woman who preceded him in the position (or the girl who came after him)? Or write something from the point of view of one of the books, or the books collectively? Or . . . is the peace of this idyllic place threatened by some (literary) danger that Morris and the books have to fight off? (But please not any of the books themselves being evil. I don't think my feelings could handle that. I'd also prefer not to have something that veers into issuefic or politics, like an allegory about censorship or whatever.) Or maybe explore the moment when he hands someone a book and they turn from greyed-out to color? What was going on in their life that made them feel so grey, and what does the moment of transformation feel like?

Please no: PWP (porn without plot), body horror, mpreg, poly, infidelity, incest, non-canonical asexuality, mundane/modern AUs, references to contemporary real-world politics, or Christian holidays (preferably no references to Christianity).

This video is just so much fun! I love the musical combat and the Western/steampunk setting, and of course Lindsey Stirling's violin playing!

The Sword of Welleran - Lord Dunsany 

In this short story, the spirits of six dead warriors sense that their beloved city is threatened and return as dreams in order to save it:


  <em>Then said Welleran to his comrades: 'Our hands can hold swords no more, our voices cannot be heard, we are stalwart men no longer. We are but dreams, let us go among dreams. Go all of you, and thou too, young Iraine, and trouble the dreams of all the men that sleep, and urge them to take the old swords of their grandsires that hang upon the walls, and to gather at the mouth of the ravine; and I will find a leader and make him take my sword.'</em>


I would love to read more about the deeds of Merimna's heroes, either in time of battle or time of peace, or the history of Merimna. Please see letter for prompts.

Final Fantasy IX 
Freya Crescent (Final Fantasy IX)

Freya-centric character study that happens after events of the game. I’m into delving deep into her straddling her responsibilities as a knight of Burmecia, particularly when both Burmecia and Cleyra are rebuilding, and her personal feelings as someone who went on her own journey to find Fratley and trying to reconcile with the disappointment of that venture. Basically, I’m all about the lady knights and their feelings of love and country.

Fire Emblem Echoes: Mou Hitori no Eiyuu Ou | Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia 
Sonya (Shadows of Valentia)

I feel there’s not a whole lot of Sonya-centered fics, especially when her backstory is as rich as hers. I like to either a prequel story of how she grew up in the priory while with her sisters, how her family steadily came apart, and then her own journey up to working as a mercenary and meeting up with Celica’s gang. Or a story of what happened to her after the events of the game, and whether the rumor of her being the new witch of Nuibaba’s place was actualized. Any character relationship can be thrown in, as I’m opened to whether she is shipped with someone or not, but if there are to be other significant character interactions, it’d be with Genny or maybe Deen.

Final Fantasy VI 
Setzer Gabbiani (FFVI), Edgar Roni Figaro (FFVI), Macías \"Mash\" Rene Figaro | Sabin Rene Figaro (FFVI)

Setzer and Figaro twins character study. can happen before or after the World of Ruin. I like to think these three are similar in the sense that they do risky things to change their fate or to follow what they wanted for themselves or other people. I also think Setzer would be intrigued by the two, or just Edgar, on how a king like him can put on a facade of shallowness while choosing to shoulder the kingdom for his family.

Flatliners (1990) 
Nelson Wright, David Labraccio

The interactions between these two characters totally made this movie, in my humble opinion. Best friends, friendly competition, maybe more? I love how they both seem to be the only ones who can effect the others stubborn nature. Slash preferred, gen is ok, but please don't pair either up with Rachel. Exploring how they first met or relations pre-movie would be fun, or angsting about relationships post-movie, or even just some fun bromance fic or school friends/rivals fic. Smut and/or PWP welcome, please no het.

(Also, if you've seen the \"remake/reboot/sequel\" by the time you start writing and feel inspired to weave it in somehow feel free (I can't believe Nelson would go by such a terrible fake name but I'm sure fic could provide a perfect fix/explanation!)

Dark City (1998) 
Daniel Schreber, John Murdoch

Anything with these two being awesome will make me ridiculously happy. They're my OTP but I also really enjoy the few friend-fics I've read of them too. I'm engrossed in the idea that, with the way the movie ends, they'd need each other to keep going forward. The only two humans in the city truly aware of it's nature and history.
Genfic is fine but in that case I'd prefer no het/other romantic relationships involving these two.

Mirrors (2008) 
Ben Carson (Mirrors), Larry Byrne (Mirrors)

Ben/Larry is the tiny little pairing of my heart, so anything with them interacting in a positive fashion is really really great. Minimal to no involvement with Amy Carson if possible. Elaborating on Ben and Larry's background together hinted at in the deleted scenes could be fun, or meeting up if Ben manages to get back to the real world. Smut is love, but no het please. As long as the fic involves Something Good happening in Ben's life that isn't his wife, I will be ecstatic. If that Something Good is Larry, that's even better.
