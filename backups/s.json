It's the first book I turn back to whenever I get depressed, because it always lifts me up.\n\nI love, love, love Ella &amp; Arieda's friendship.  I love that they are both outsiders at finishing school that manage to find each other, and my heart always breaks when Ella has to leave Arieda.  I would love an AU where they fall in love, and that's how Ella eventually breaks her curse.  (I'm not 100% sure how that would work with Hattie's order, but if you can think of a way...)  I'd also love post-canon fic featuring these two, either friendship fic or femslash fic. (Fairest takes place in Ayortha, Arieda's home country, and is about Arieda's sister.  I've read it, though it doesn't hold my heart like Ella Enchanted does.  Feel free to crib from it, or not.)\n\nI also love Ella/Char-- they have a lovely relationship in canon, and I would love to see more.  Maybe something where Ella meets Char's parents and sister as herself, not as Lela?  Or something featuring the two of them going on adventures together.  Or just a moment with them walking through the royal menagerie together or sliding down stair rails or something else ridiculous.\n\nI've also been thinking about Ella/Char/Arieda lately.  We don't get a lot of Char &amp; Arieda interaction in the book-- only a journal entry from Char recounting their conversation about Ella, but I think they would get along if Arieda wasn't treating him so much like a prince.  So I'd love something post-canon where Arieda visits her friends in Frell and ~feelings~ happen between the three of them.\n\nI'd also like something from Mandy's point of view.  What is it like, being the godmother to all the women in Ella's family for so long?  What kind of hidden magics does she normally do?  Was there ever a time when she did \"big magic\", like Lucinda?  Or anything that focuses on the relationship between her and Ella, especially once Ella's father is remarried and Dame Olga is in the picture, would be lovely.\n\nLetter: http://saiditallbefore.dreamwidth.org/1078.html\n\n\n"

I love the crazy twists, how meta it got with the beginning of the second season, the Groundhog Day stuff happening, the jokes and philosophical pondering mixing.  I know how hard it can be to write for an ongoing canon and that anything here could be jossed at any point before reveals, but please don’t sweat it!

Seriously, what was that one where Eleanor and Tahani were soulmates like?  WHO SEDUCED MICHAEL THAT ONE TIME?  (Was it Jason?  Because he would have been down, and Eleanor would totally have made him do it.)  Going forward, I’m looking forward to our four humans (and Janet!) teaming up with Michael.  Or...anything.  Honestly, I don’t know what’s going to happen from week to week!  Please feel free to write in missing scenes or canon divergence AUs or whatever!  \n\nOne fair warning: while I do ship Chidi/Eleanor (and everyone else), I ship them as unlikely friends-turned-lovers.  I’m not into them as Perfect Forever Soulmates.

It did not disappoint!  It's charming and sweet and sad and hopeful all at once.  And it's yuri!!!\n\nSara is so delightful. &lt;3  She's so optimistic and such a dreamer, and it's so heartbreaking when things get bad for her.  The bit after her imaginary feast with Becky and Ermengarde is broken up is always one of the saddest parts, to me-- she looks around, and she can't imagine any more.  I would love some post-canon fic here!  The game presents some AU options that aren't present in the novel; I'd love to see some of the adventures that Sara takes with one of the other girls after Mr. Carraway finds her.  Or maybe she does become a governess and leave Miss Minchin's, like she thought about in the Mariette storyline?  Or post-canon fic where Sara visits Ermengarde at her aunt's house would be lovely. Or maybe a canon divergent fic, about what might have happened if Mr. Carraway had never found Sara?  \n\nBecky is my favorite in the book, and she's my favorite in the game.  I love how she and Sara support each other, even (especially) when they have no one else.  Post-canon fic where they're together and living happy lives would be great (maybe Becky gets to wear pretty pink dresses, too?).  \n\nI really loved how the game expanded on Jessie, and I'd also love post-canon fic about Jessie and Sara travelling and having adventures together!  Alternatively, the Mariette storyline has Sara thinking about becoming a governess and leaving Miss Minchin's, while in the Jessie storyline, Sara doesn't seem to see a way out for either of them.  Maybe that's their way out?  Maybe they find a placement at some nice school or house somewhere, and live happily-ever-after (or happily-for-now).  In this universe, does Mr. Carraway ever find Sara?  (It's okay if he doesn't, as long as Jessie and Sara find happiness in some form.)\n\nLavinia has issues.  Like, capital-I issues.  In fact, she's kind of a terrible person!  But I kind of got attached to her by the end of her route anyway.  Anything post-canon would be great, especially if Lavinia continues to grow as a person.  (Though, don't sand away all the rough edges!)  I'd also love a compromise between her ending and Jessie's, where she and Sara and Jessie are all happy together (or mostly happy, at least).\n\nLetter: http://saiditallbefore.dreamwidth.org/1078.html\n\n\n"

Montgomery's books, though I seem to be in the minority even among her fans. While it does have a few problems (one of the subplots gets hella racist), I love this book and all of the characters.  I had a truly terrible time narrowing my nominations down to just 4 characters (poor Gay Penhallow and Aunt Becky just couldn't make the cut), but please don't let that stop you!  I will take fic about basically anyone except the Sams.\n\nIn general, I'd like to read something about the characters post-canon.  I want to hear about Margaret, now that she's finally got her little house and has adopted Brian.  The rest of the clan probably gives her an awful time about being jilted by Penny- or do they?  If you are up for it, I would especially like a story where Margaret falls in love with a woman. I can definitely see Margaret as a lesbian.\n\nWe saw a little of how Jocelyn started to rebuild her life with Hugh after her awful mistake; how do they go on?  (Headcanon alert: Jocelyn always seems to me to be a very blunt person; I've always headcanoned her to be more like the Next Coming of Aunt Becky than anyone else.  But with a bit more empathy.)  Are things suddenly just better?  Does Jocelyn get bored with Hugh again and look somewhere else, or do they make it work?\n\nAnd Donna and Peter- tell me all about their adventures together as a couple! I'd also be interested in Donna's friendship with Virginia, before and after Donna's second marriage. Or maybe an AU where Donna and Peter don't fall in love, but instead Donna and Virginia's pledge of eternal widowhood is partly because the two of them are in love?\n\nNan gets kind of villainized in the book- which is understandable!  She steals Gay's fiance!  But she's also a very modern young woman coming back to a very old-fashioned clan, and her mores don't match up.  I would love anything with Nan having whirlwind adventures in the big city, or with her adjusting to living back home in a small town where everyone knows everyone.  And if some of Nan's adventures involve her making out with other women, I would totally be down with that!  An AU where she ends up ~seducing~ Gay and the two of them have a very scandalous relationship would also be welcome!\n\nLetter: http://saiditallbefore.dreamwidth.org/1078.html\n\n\n"

I realize that I ramble on a bit below in the details, but feel free to disregard whatever of it that hinders your creativity - they're really only suggestions and ideas, and should not be limitations to your writing. I am very aware of the optional details being optional, but in case your creativity is helped by me going into a bit more detail, here you go!\n\nMy general likes and dislikes are as follows:\n\nI like: \"lost moments\" (=pivotal moments to a character that the book skips over), happy endings, romance, plot, character exploration.\nI dislike: noncon, character death, incest, underage sex, unhappy endings, kink. I'd prefer not to get a PWP/sex story.\nMy preferred ratings are G, PG-13 or R, although NC-17 is also fine with me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, about this particular request - \"A Talent for War\" offers us these tantalizing glimpses into the past, of the resistance and the characters involved there, and we know from the epilogue that Walford Chandler's \"lost pilot\" did indeed find Christopher Sim on Belamoncourt and brought him home, but we never get any scene of or glimpse at Leisha Tanner and Christopher Sim actually interacting. We know they must have, as she ended up joining his staff, and clearly cared enough to go looking for him ... but ... .\n\nSo, write me a scene between the two, please? Can be from any point in time in their relationship - first meeting, during resistance times, Leisha finding him on Belamoncourt, sometime after she brought him home ... any scene, any time, is fine. (And I don't mind if you see their relationship as colleagues, friends, or romantically...)\n\n\n"

(But it's also fairly dark; it's the colorful, imaginitive kind of dark that I imagine might have happened if Scott Lynch had tried to write \"The Gentleman Bastards\" sequence for a YA audience.) The way that the series explores the importance of words and language and ideas also strongly resonates with me. But I also just adore Mosca. She's been dealt a bad hand is so angry about it. I love it when we get to see her learning new things and running full-speed with the knowledge. Her friendship with Clent is also great. They're both untrusting, down-on-their-luck tricksters who love language. I adore the fact that they spent a good portion of Fly By Night mistrusting each other, until the point where Mosca realizes <i>Clent didn't kill Partridge</i> and Clent realizes that <i>Mosca actually thought he killed Partridge</i> and they both went <i>oh shit that other person is just as scared as I am</i>. They're both too suspicious and pragmatic to admit to wanting or having friends, but that's what they are. I don't see Clent as a father-figure to Mosca (partially because I think she would reject one and partially because of his comment in Flytrap about forgetting that \"[her] small size is the result of youth, not pickling\"), but I can see him as sort of a mentor. \n\nLikes:\nheistfic (characters committing crime heck yeah)\nmutual pining\nfake dating\n(which dovetails nicely with both heistfic and pining)\nbanter\ncompetence (and characters being turned on by each others' competence)\ncanon divergence AUs\nand time loops\nthe intersection of time loops with canon divergences - it gives the chance for characters to see What Could Have Been (either good or bad) and suffer accordingly\ncharacters who are bad at admitting they have feelings\nthose characters then having feelings and not knowing how to deal with it\ncharacters who aren't used to affection getting affection and not knowing what to do with it\npolitical infrastructure and scheming\ndark!fic (especially with psychological manipulation)\n\nDNW:\nCross-overs (fusions are okay, though)\nA/B/O\nMundane AUs (High School/College, Coffeeshop, etc. Any AU that involves the characters Committing Less Crime, basically)\nMajor Character Death\nwatersports/scat play\nhomophobia, especially internalized homophobia\nkid!fic or pregnancy\nfirst/second person narration\n\nStory suggestions:\n-    Mosca and Clent spend some time on the road discussing scandalous uses of an illegal printing press that they would never ever try. (Bonus, if you want to add Plot: this is fine until the moment one of these never-ever discussions is their only option to get out of trouble. Maybe they need to distract the authorities or frame someone else as the owner of a printing press. Maybe they need to sway public opinion. Maybe they need to evacuate a town and think scaring everyone into leaving is the way to do it. Maybe they're delivering misinformation to armies working against Mandelion.)\n\n-    Mosca and Clent accidentally get hired to run a mayoral election campaign. Does Clent try to escape at the first chance or does he welcome the opportunity? How does Mosca feel about democracy as a variation on governance? Are the guilds interfering the election and if so, how? When Clent and Mosca start succeeding, does that put them at risk of being murdered?\n\nLetter: http://beekeeperofeden.dreamwidth.org/14195.html\n\n\n"

(I like fish-out-of-water stories and competence-porn stories and oh-god-I-got-an-affection-what-does-it-do? stories and The Goblin Emperor is ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.) I also really like Csethiro. She seems much less adept at people-ing than Maia is, judging from her remark about \"having the sense to not scare [him.]\" But once she realizes that she might like him, she tries.

I especially like fic set in the sellswords era (Silent Blade through Road of the Patriarch), the Legacy/Starless Night era, and after Gauntlgrym.\n\nEntreri and Jarlaxle are my favorites and I ship the heck out of them. Things I like about them: Ruthless pragmatism and communications issues up the wazoo. They keep trying to manipulate each other and (especially in Jarlaxle's case) it keeps making things worse. I like to think that they will eventually get to a point of trusting each other, but I recognize that there will probably be some stabbing along the way. (I have a weakness for characters that are too pragmatic to want emotional attachments getting emotional attachments anyway and not knowing what to do with them.)\n\nI also really like Dwahvel. She's smart, she's practical, and I get the sense that she probably compartmentalizes the heck out of her emotions. (Given how much she works with Entreri after he kills Dondon, either she had very complicated feelings about her cousin or she can compartmentalize like a mofo. Probably both.) She has to walk a very delicate line in order to keep her much smaller guild safe, and yet she chooses to align herself with Entreri, who seems prone to destablizing everything he touches. I'd love to see more day-to-day stuff about how she runs her guild or how she got started. (And if you wanted to ship her with Sharlotta I wouldn't complain...)\n\nI understand that getting all three of my requested characters in the same fic may make writing a bit frustrating, so you have my explicit permission to omit one.&nbsp;\n\nLikes:\nheistfic (characters committing crime heck yeah)\nmutual pining\nfake dating\n(which dovetails nicely with both heistfic and pining)\nbanter\ncompetence (and characters being turned on by each others' competence)\ncanon divergence AUs\nand time loops\nthe intersection of time loops with canon divergences - it gives the chance for characters to see What Could Have Been (either good or bad) and suffer accordingly\ncharacters who are bad at admitting they have feelings\nthose characters then having feelings and not knowing how to deal with it\ncharacters who aren't used to affection getting affection and not knowing what to do with it\npolitical infrastructure and scheming\ndark!fic (especially with psychological manipulation)\n\nDNW:\n\n    Cross-overs (fusions are okay, though)\nA/B/O\nMundane AUs (High School/College, Coffeeshop, etc. Any AU that involves the characters Committing Less Crime, basically)\nMajor Character Death\nwatersports/scat play\nhomophobia, especially internalized homophobia\nkid!fic or pregnancy\nfirst/second person narration\ncharacter bashing\nIdalia's Flute treated as a positive/healthy influence\n\nStory suggestions:\nDuring the Servant of the Shard roadtrip, Jarlaxle tries seduction as a tactic to get the shard back and it doesn't work. Later, when he flirts with Entreri after the Shard is destroyed, Entreri's first reaction is to assume this is a trick and flirt back in the most obstructive manner possible, partially because it's fun--let's be honest, this is barely a deviation from their existing banter--and partially to figure out Jarlaxle's angle. This leads to mutually annoyed sexual tension and what can only be described as a war of escalation on both sides. It's up to you if they actually manage to get past aggressive flirting and into bed.\n\n    Jarlaxle and Dwahvel finally get to meet (either during an AU sellswords era where they end up back in Calimport or after RotP when Jarlaxle inevitably tries something foolish to talk to Entreri). How would they get along? Would they compare their (rather similar) tactical choices? I can't imagine Dwahvel got a very flattering impression of him from Entreri's description of the Crystal Shard problems. If they meet after the events of Road of the Patriarch, does Dwahvel want to get as much information as she can or just get him to go the fuck away? Is Entreri there and, if so, is he helping steer the conversation or just enjoying the show?\n\n     Any sort of backstory fic where the characters are plotting their way to the top would be fun. (How did Dwahvel set up her guild in the Copper Ante? What happened with that partner--Tallan Belmer--that Entreri apparently had and then killed? Surely Bregan D'aerthe has gotten betrayed by their employers at least once--how would that go down?)\n\n    If you're familiar with the later canon, I'd love to see some canon divergence and/or time travel fic regarding the debacle with Charon's Claw and the Netherese.\n\nLetter: http://beekeeperofeden.dreamwidth.org/14195.html\n\n\n"

How does Artemisia navigate her own feelings, both about sex and propriety? Does Katherine figure everything out on her own or does she find someone (such as the Black Rose) to ask for advice?\n\n    How does Katherine's ability to stab people affect Hill politics? Do swordsmen come back into style as a sincere safeguard against assassination? Do other nobles accuse her of being willing to indiscriminately attack her political rivals?

I loved how the Expert would play with your sorrow-spider, imitating the spiders eight-legged movements with her meager two arms. Her honey dreams of becoming a spider, and her fascination with how to become as spider-council. How did the Expert get to be the way she was? Is she a normal woman obsessed with spiders? Or is she a spider, forced into a human body and trying to return? A character study and origin story for her would be great. \n\nI would love it if instead of leaving after her quest sequence was done, the Expert pursues a romance with a female PC, or enlists the PC as her friend to help her in her search for more knowledge of spider-councils. Perhaps the Expert and the PC go to Zee, or explore the frozen North or go to Venderbight in the quest for knowledge. Maybe the Expert tries to make her lover/friend into a spider (like herself - perhaps the Expert was a spider-council all along), or she tries to transform herself into a spider. Maybe, after learning enough, the Expert decides that humanity is enough. Obviously, I cannot get enough body horror for this pairing, and weird sex would be a bonus to anything. You can get reaaaaally spidery with it. Suddenly eight eyes? Spinnerets? Venomous fangs? Some blood-drinking? You could also just write regular human sex; I’m game. \n\nThe Expert and the PC could also get into all manner of other mysteries in the Neath - exploring whatever storylines you find interesting or pulling from the various scenarios I’ve put in my general likes. Fusions/crossovers with Sunless Sea are welcome. There's also the option of pairing the Expert with various female NPCs!\n\nGeneral do not wants: \n\nAUs (i.e. mundane, modern, gender, magical, etc.), except for canon divergence and ones specifically requested.\nKids.

	"fandom": "Gentleman Bastard Sequence - Scott Lynch ",
	"characters": "Jean Tannen, Locke Lamora",
	"prompt": "I don't normally read fantasy books thick enough that they could be used as a doorstop, because I never love the characters enough. That was absolutely not the case as I read all 3 of these books in short succession. I love the confidence games the Bastards run, where the purpose is to defraud the hell out of the rich. Jean and Locke have a wonderful dynamic that keeps getting more and more codependent as the books go on. I'm pretty sure that Scott Lynch has a hurt/comfort and service kink going on, based on how books 2 and 3 both start with Jean taking care of Locke while he's mostly helpless and being pathetic. I ship them intensely, but it’d be easy to make any of my ship prompts gen and I’d still be happy. \n\nLocke is both incredibly capable and incredibly good at fucking things up, which I love. I'm obsessed with the trope of 'villain gets amnesia and turns good,' which Republic of Thieves delivered to me in yet another moment where I felt like Scott Lynch was out to get me right in all my narrative kinks. Locke being haunted by the past he can't remember (potentially having flashbacks to how he was 'born,’ or his old life) would be a great setup for angst between him and Jean. Jean is such a great character, particularly since he combines a lot of kindness, caring, and literary nerdiness with a bad temper and having the build of the Stereotypical Bruiser. The books really explore his loyalty to Locke, though they never quite fully explain why Jean’s life has to revolve around him, so digging into why he’s so loyal would be fascinating. Perhaps it has something to do with Locke’s secret evil undead wizardry, and Locke is bewitching Jean without realizing it?\n\nI love Camorr, so I'd be happy to read fic set while the Bastards were there. I'm really fond of the Sanzas, sharks, and toxic honor culture.There's also so much about Tel Verrar and the time spent gaming the Sinspire that'd be worth exploring. If you're also into Jean/Locke, I'm super interested in canon divergence where they got together while the Sanzas and Bug were still alive, or if something made the ship happen during the second book. I'm not interested in fic set when Jean and Locke were teens.\n\nPretend relationship turning to real relationship would work well with a con, and is a trope I love. Locke and Jean getting trapped in a small space while hiding out from something and then boners happen. Locke and Jean go to Emberlain and it’s terribly snowy and Locke gets hypothermia and jean takes care of him and then they have sex. Maybe Locke gets creatively poisoned again, and he thinks he's dying and deals with his feelings by having sex with Jean, but then it turns out Locke wasn't dying after all. So many possibilities! You also don’t have to write getting-together fic - I’d be happy with established relationship where they go on some sort of adventure or just have some good sex. I’d prefer that if you write anal sex, Locke bottoms, but I’m not super attached to the idea. \n\nI would also deeply appreciate fic where Locke has to crossdress for a job, which results in Jean coming to terms with the fact that he wants to fuck his friend, and Locke realizes that he loves wearing dresses/skirts and also wants to fuck his friend. You could also go for a light-hearted roleplay element in it, like Locke is practicing his role for the con as ‘sexy forgetful maid’ and Jean is the ‘serious-minded tough’ and they end up taking it further than expected (to sex). Crossdressing or no, any sort of roleplaying (or practice roleplaying) for a scheme that ends up in sex would be great.\n\nNote: I would totally dig any sort of crossover or fusion of the Gentlemen Bastards with the Dishonored or Fallen London universes, provided that the focus is on Jean and Locke rather than the characters from the other verses.\n\nGeneral do not wants: \n\nAUs (i.e. mundane, modern, gender, magical, etc.), except for canon divergence and ones specifically requested.\nKids.

I also adore illustrative art that captures a scene or moment of fic or canon.

	"prompt": "Thank you so much for writing for me!\n\nFirst, something that goes for all my requests: I don't have any triggers or dealbreaking squicks (though I'd prefer you to avoid explicit underage), and I'd welcome fic of any tone, form or genre - rating or weirdness no object! If my suggestions spark something, that's great, but I'd much rather you write the fic you want to write, whether or not it has anything at all to do with my prompts. Please, feel free and have fun.\n\n    --\n\nI love how uncanny and kind and lavishly autumnal this show is, how it functions as a glorious, melancholy remix/reprise of just about the entire American cartooning tradition (not to mention Miyazaki and Tove Jansson and Sylvain Chomet and Dante and probably a zillion other references) while remaining very much its own beast (Beast?). I love how truly all ages it is, how it manages to be wryly acute about the tribulations of both childhood and adolescence - not to mention genuinely creepy- without shutting out younger viewers. I love how it deals with death and disguising: how it gets down to the bones of Halloween. I love the characters, from Wirt's teenage catastrophizing to Greg's secret guilt and matter-of-fact oddness. And I love how the series is grounded in the real world, in an ordinary American Halloween, without ever quite tipping The Unknown into 'it was all just a dream' territory.\n\nI really enjoyed just about everything the show gave us wrt Beatrice, from giving the Dantesque guide character a redemptive story-arc of her very own, through having her spend most of the show as an adorable bluebird, right down to making her a constant source of high-quality snark and exquisitely passive-aggressive put-downs. I'd be interested to see her taking a trip to the land of the living - does she gatecrash another age-appropriate drinking session in the cemetery, or get trapped in our world of oddly untalkative animals and have to find her way back into the Unknown (with the help of Wirt and Greg, and/or a finally-unmasked Sara)? If you want to locate The Unknown as definitively the world of the dead, does that mean Beatrice is aware of her post-life status? Doe she remember what it was like over on the other side?\n\nWe don't get a great deal of Sara, but I was really charmed by what we did see, from her kickass skeleton costume to her willingness to hang out in graveyards drinking age-appropriate drinks. I'd love to see her interacting with The Unknown in any capacity - an AU where she accompanies Greg and Wirt from the start? A solo journey, where she gets to know Beatrice on her own account, or discovers that there's a place for her ballet (or wrestling) skills in The Unknown? A post-canon fic where she gets curious about Wirt's odd remarks and his brother's unusually musical frog? Another bait-and-switch, where it turns out she was in on the secret all along? After all, there is that skeleton costume, and we never quite see her face: to some extent she really is, well, Unknown.\n\nAnd, well, I found Wirt painfully easy to identify with, as an erstwhile self-serious adolescent with a much younger sibling. I would absolutely love seeing how he dealt with the aftermath of their trip to The Unknown, whether you wanted to go with an immediate follow-up or something set at some point in the (distant?) future. I can see a great story in a fic which follows a grown-up Wirt (plus Greg, and perhaps Sara?) back into The Unknown - could they find their way back, this time around? What does The Unknown look like through adult eyes? \n\nOr, for that matter, through the Beast's eyes, however many of them there actually are? The Beast is such a wonderful, genuinely terrifying anagonist - I'd love a flat-out horror fic, or an origin story. Or what about a fic in which The Unknown - or the Beast - begins to infiltrate the everyday world? Less terrifyingly ... just what does happen to Greg's friend the frog? (No, seriously, if you want to write an entirely frog-centric fic following his adventures in our world, I would be delighted).\n\n Really, I just love the show as a whole and would love to see more of its world and its people, from the horrifying (the edelwood trees!) to the wonderful and weird. If you'd like to play around with interactive fiction, for instance, this seems like a good place for it (all those branching paths in that dark wood...). Or a ghost story, perhaps (starring Beatrice?). Something which slips in and out of pastiche would be entirely true to canon - I'm absolutely open to crossovers and/or intertextual references (not that I can promise to catch them all, of course!).\n\n\n"

	"username": "Selden",

	"characters": "Kieren Walker, Simon Monroe",
	"prompt": "I loved this sweet, sad, sharp little show: how generously metaphorical its central conceit was, how suggestive its mythology and worldbuilding, how fiercely hopeful it remained for all that it was full of horror and petty cruelty and the corrosiveness of fear. I've nominated Kieron and Simon, but I'd be delighted with fic that focused on expanding the post-Rising world, or on answering some of the questions the end of season 2 left open: what is to become of Amy? Of Jem? Of Maxine? One of my very favourite aspects of the show was its sense of place: how rooted it was in the landscape and community of Roarton; how much attention it paid to the dangerous (in this case, almost literally apocalyptic) dynamics of local gossip and old-new prejudices. Fic which worked along these lines (minutes from meetings of the Roarton Historical Society before, during, and after the Rising?), or which expanded on the nightmarish bureaucracy faced by 'PDS sufferers' (to chilling and/or comedic effect) would be amazing.\n\n(Incidentally, intrigued though I am by the implications of Amy's canon fate - and much as I refuse to buy that her second death was intended to be final - I'm not all that interested in seeing the undead returned wholesale to life, or at least not with this being presented as an uncomplicated happy ending.)\n\nI should admit, as well, that In The Flesh was crammed full with tropes I absolutely love. 'Monsters' trying desperately to pass for human; characters haunted and threatened by the loss of their very identity (and identity-porn in general); the everyday mechanics of uncanny bodies; body-horror and unethical human experimentation galore ... if your fic leans into the curve on any of these aspects, I would be delighted.\n\nI'd also be delighted with flat-out shipfic: how do Kieran and Simon negotiate their romance, after the end of season 2? How do they manage sex, if they do so at all? (I'd be more than fine with sweet/unsettling/hilarious zombie porn adventures!). How does Kieran cope with being the subject of some of the same messianic zeal that Simon once applied to the cause of the Undead Liberation Army - with having become, perhaps, Simon's new Cause? How does Simon deal with Kieran's tendency to second-guess himself, to sink into apathy or despair? How do they both manage to sustain a relationship across possible centuries of unlife? (And, ngl, I'd prefer it if they did.) What does the world look like, five centuries after The Rising? After Amy's (assumed) second resurrection? When Roarton itself is gone, and all its living inhabitants distant memories? There's a lot of room here for epic scope and aching bittersweetness (or flat-out darkfic: absolutely welcome), but I'm also very fond of the dopey, earnest awkwardness of Simon and Kieran's early courtship: I'd love just another supper with Kieran's family, or perhaps a meeting with an older Jem, post-canon. Or, well, just a day in the unlife. Village fêtes optional!\n\n\n"

	"characters": "Awful Sykes, Erskine (Archer's Goon), Venturus (Archer's Goon)",
	"prompt": "Archer's Goon is right up there among my very, very favourite Wynne Jones books, and to be honest I'd love just about anything which expanded or deepened the world of the novel, whether or not it focused on my nominated characters. After all, part of what makes the book so compelling is that so much is left to the imagination, even after Howard/Venturus has managed to unpick most of his identities: the narrative is full of characters emerging from nowhere and indeed zooming off into it, in a spaceship no less. And yet, of course, we can infer quite a lot about these various nowheres - and the hints we get are disquieting, to say the least. Anything that built on this - following along on that spaceship, for instance - would be amazing.\n\nThat being said, I <i>would</i> very much like to see, for instance, what happens when Awful and Howard/Venturus grow up. There's a suggestion in the book that Awful might have inherited more than a touch of the family's power (perhaps all that proximity to Venturus brought it out in her) - is this in fact the case? If so, does she really grow up into a second Shine? Just how much chaos does she wreak, or refrain from wreaking?  (And just how much does Howard/Venturus cause, trying to be A Responsible Brother for once?). Not to mention, what does happen once Erskine returns from travelling the world? Do he and a grown-up Awful really hit it off? Does he come back, as Howard fears he might, with a rekindled taste for a spot of light world-ruling? Come to that, does Howard manage to restrain his own worst impulses, this time around? I'd love answers to any of these questions, or something more low-key and slice of life: one of the things I love most about the novel is the way it refracts fucked-up family dynamics through the strictures of petty local beaurocracy, and in doing so illuminates the intricacies, horrors, and even the hidden strengths of both - not to mention painting a pretty compelling picture of small-town British life, rain and knotty history and grotty polytechnic all included. Basically, if you want to confront your cosmically-powered characters with something akin to the road-mending extravaganza of the first chapters, I would be <i>there for it</i>. Perhaps Archer and co manage to turn their spaceship around and exact their revenge by trapping the rest of the family within the town boundaries once more? (Speaking of that spaceship, I would honestly also love a fic which took it upon itself to rescue Fifi, who I always felt got a truly raw deal. Perhaps <i>she</i> comes back and exacts her revenge, somehow or other (through the power of petty beaurocracy?)).\n\nBasically, I enjoy just about everything about this book, especially how brilliantly it paints a portrait both of a place, and of two overlapping families. I even love how downright cruel the story sometimes is (that spaceship! Fifi!), and how uncertain it seems that Venturus' family will ever be able to build a place for themselves on earth, at least without transforming it entirely. There's lots of space for darkfic here, and I'd be fascinated to see it. But I also love the warmth which the novel fights its way towards - the realisation that the bonds between some of the siblings can be salvaged and celebrated; the vision of family life which Howard/Venturus literally turns back time to have some chance at securing. I'd love to see more of Quentin and Catriona, as welll as Torquil and Hathaway - I can see rich potential, for example, for some exquisitely awkward - if potentially heartwarming - family dinners. Anything which played off this element - the power of family, be it lost, found, saved from the (municipal) scrapheap, or quarantined in the depths of outer space - would be amazing. Feel free, by the way, to nudge the setting towards the present-day or to keep it a period piece (that polytechnic! Fifi's legwarmers!). Or, indeed, to play around with time itself - its not as if there isn't canon precedent! And, well, if you just wanted to provide a series of extracts from Quentin's various two-thousand-word tax 'payments', I definitely wouldn't say no (perhaps with annotations courtesy of Awful and/or Howard?). Really, go small, go big - go spaceship or city hall - it's not as if the novel doesn't give you room for either extreme, and I'd love just about anything which gave me more of its world.\n\n\n"

First off: her TAKENOSHIT attitude about his little smug butt at first, the fact that she's a warrior badass in her own right.  Second: it's when she's threatened that he's able to use the sword for the first time.  COINCIDENCE?  I THINK NOT.  One of my favourite things about this movie is how Arthur doesn't even question the Mage's role within their group and develops a lot of trust and respect for her quickly.\n\nIn fact, Arthur's general respect of women - and desire to protect them - was basically the reason why I fucking loved this movie right off the bat.  There's no judgement on how women in the brothel raised money, and his rage at these women being mistreated and seeking justice for them was fantastic.  PLEASE CONTINUE THAT THREAD IN THE FIC.  Arthur respecting women regardless of their position in society?  YES PLEASE.\n\nI'd love something that follows after the movie, exploring a possible future between the two.

Go nuts!\n\nIf cracky Hall stuff isn't your speed, I'd also love to see something set after their time at the Hall, in college where they're figuring themselves out at that level and having wider social circles etc. We know that Boots's parents aren't super high on Bruno, does that get better or worse when they start dating?\n\nLetter: http://shoemaster.dreamwidth.org/516249.html\n\n\n"

(YES to both of these, if you please). \n\n(1a) I’d love the adventure where they met and got together, especially if there are hints of the divergent paths they are going to take once the Empire takes over. Maybe Fentara was on the squad providing security for one of Lyn's ExploraCorps missions? Maybe they met at uni on Coruscant?\n\n(1b) Or, what about the last mission they were on together, when the horizon was darkening and their political differences started to be irreconcilable. An unhappy, wistful ending or/and bitter angsty breakup fic is fine in this case, the darker the better! I want to read about difficult choices, and the pressures of encroaching space!fascism, and the betrayal of realizing that your lover is willing to join an organization that doesn’t consider you a full person.\n\n(2) <b>Yaris Gurt, OD-44</b>: I requested these two characters, but what I really want is ensemble fic: wacky hijinks and workplace shenanigans on the dysfunctional Imperial Base in the Roach System. I’m in love with the disaster evil!NPCs of this arc, and I would love fic about day-to-day life on this base just before the Mynock crew arrives: the focus could be on any or all of them (and with or without any and all pairings):\n\n(2a)Yaaris Gurt’s fanfiction! Maybe she covertly processes her workplace shenanigans by writing ‘Regency-Era’ slash fic? Is there anyone she likes on the Base? [What  is Regency Era for Star Wars? Heck, if you wanted to pastiche what her fic might look like, and write the faux!space!heyer tale of true love, dastardly dueling, and last-minute rescue starring self-insert!Yaris and a bunch of people with names on the German Name + Tomato model, I’d love that!]\n\n(2b) OD-44/Yaris: I’m always here for the unrequited love of an AI for an officer of an Evil Space Empire. Full stop. \n\n(2c) OD-44: Do they hate Captain Drine because of some perceived (or real) slight to the engineer?  Is it normal droid protocal to label all the humans they interact with with emoji? Or is that one of OD-44's peculiar quirks? An ensemble fic from OD’s exasperated/hostile perspective would also be great!\n\n(2d) I didn't request other characters from the ensemble, like D'Phn, Zoth, Shinro, Drine, but feel free to include them to whatever degree you like (I have some prompts about possible directions in the linked letter)\n\nA GENERAL NOTE\n\n-I’m writing this letter as of episode 90; if we matched on this fandom, I imagine you are basically caught up, too, since I requested characters that were very recently introduced.

Why couldn't she get any of her fellow-officers interested in joining her? Was it because she played a 'scandalous' instrument and was shy about asking for partners (or was rebuffed when she did ask)? Was she from a 'very provincial' House and therefore snubbed? It seems like she must have been a 'favorite' -- but was she? Did she just view One Esk as a convenient tool for picking up the other parts, or did she come to treat her Ship differently once it became her musical partner? I would also love details of Radchaai culture and politics from this period nearly 2000 years before Ancillary Justice, although still 1000 years into Anaander Mianaai's rule, when the empire was smaller (whatever that means for an enormous galactic empire), even more socially stratified-- and perhaps closer tied-in to the original dyson sphere? What were the Entertainments like? What musical styles were trendy? What did this lieutenant's tea-set look like?\n\n(2)The epic that Breq sings in Ancillary Sword and mentions was (a) composed 1500 years ago was banned in the Radch but (b) still circulates outside of it. I'm equally intrigued by the possibilities of both of these points:\n\n(2a) Did Breq only come to learn about this poem after Justice of Toren was destroyed? If yes, I'd love to know the circumstances of her visit to one of those 'places outside the Radch' where dissident Radchaai poetry is circulating. Are there systems that have universities with 'Departments of Radch Studies'? Or were there always Radchaai diaspora communities out there, descended from people who fled Anaander Mianaai's rule for one reason or another? Breq interacting with either of these groups -- or in any other situation you think up where she comes across this revisionist, anti-Anaander epic -- would be fascinating. \n\n(2a- corollary) If you want to write academia-fic about Breq being That Person at a public lecture who gets into a fight with a prominent specialist in Radchaai Studies or something… I love that idea in principle, but please don't straw-man historical scholarship and academia. For Yuletide, I do not want gotcha-fic about my day job.\n\n(2b) On the other hand, Justice of Toren was around when the poem was written. I'd love a story where the poet was one of One Esk's lieutenants, or where one of Justice of Toren's Esk officers somehow got involved in whatever political or literary (or both) upset surrounded the poem. I'm 100% fine with dark-fic for this: One-Esk having to shoot a favorite officer-- even, heck, Justice of Toren being ordered to forget the song (and only coming back to find it later…?\n\n(3) If you've read Provenance, and are interested in writing a crossover, I have a prompt for that in the linked letter (spoiler-hidden for those who have not yet read Provenance)\n\n(4) If none of this inspires, feel free to do anything set during or post-canon as well! I'd love more about Breq learning to work with the crew and Mercy of Kalr in those days between the end of Justice and the beginning of Sword-- maybe even from the perspective of one of the MoK crew (here I'd be really interested in themes of loyalty and authority). \n\nA COUPLE GENERAL NOTES:\n-I am only interested in gen-fic about Breq- the relationships I am interested in seeing her in are ones of loyalty, duty, mutual obligations, alliance, protection  (any and all pairings of other characters in the background is fine).\n-Please use canon pronouns.\n-I have read Provenance and all of the short stories set in this universe, and so am fine with incorporating or alluding to any world-building or other details from any of those works, if you should wish to do so.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDNWS:\n-No graphic descriptions of body horror or gore or extreme violence\n-No on-screen non-con or torture. (References and background are fine, but I'd really prefer that they not be at the center of the story, even off-screen).\n-No nuclear war, genocide, apocalyptic destruction, or death on a massive scale. (References to canon and canon-typical events are fine)\n-Please do not blow up planets (references to canon events are ok)\n-Strongly prefer no PWP/erotica/smut\n\nLetter: http://ricardienne.dreamwidth.org/276851.html\n\n\n"

As for ideas, I’d like to see something that either takes place with any of the Sam Bells that don’t appear in the movie. \n\nThe original Sam Bell is interesting-- how was his time on the base? How much did he know about the clone project? How does the recent news of Lunar Industry’s unethical practices affected him? Does he meet the Sam Bell from the moon?

Non-linear perspective is such an interesting idea, and I enjoyed how this was portrayed in the movie as scenes weaving into each other. I like the themes of knowing how something will end, but making the decision anyway, and would love to see more on that.\n\nI also loved how grounded the fim’s treatment of aliens felt. Both Ian and Louise reacted very genuinely to what was going on, and I loved how their relationship built out of that. I also really enjoyed their relationship to their respective fields, especially Louise trying to explain the need to understand language from building blocks and the importance of communication. \n\nA couple of potential things I’d like to see:\n\nWe got the skeleton of how Ian and Louise’s relationship fell apart, but I’d love to see the details of it, especially from Ian’s point of view. Trying to make a linear understanding on a non-linear perspective is something that’s very complicated, and weird, and interesting! I’d love something that either gets into the weeds of how he couldn’t handle the relationship, or just something on small moments where interacting with Louise was off, and unsettling, maybe.\n\nLouise’s perspective is also fantastic-- I loved when the film did illustrate her perspective outside of time, and how her perception flips from scene to scene. The end of the movie, with her living through many different time perspectives all at once, was lovely to watch! I’d love to see that concept expanded. \n\nSimilarly, how does the world deal with this brand new language, this brand new perspective? How does the world adapt to it? How do individual people adapt to it?

Sonya is unyielding and distant, but self-assured in her distance and in her bitterness. Celica doesn’t carry the burden of secrets nearly as well. She keeps a polite distance from people, but never comes across as she really wants to. It’s an interesting dynamic to me. As for their interactions, I also really enjoyed Sonya’s blunt teasing of Celica in her first base conversation, along with the prodding to speak her mind more. \n\nFor what I want to see between them-- gen or romance is good! I really liked their base conversations, and think there’s a lot of common ground between them, even if it goes unstated. Anything that emphasizes this common ground is something I want to see. Mostly, I want to see some kind of post-canon interaction between them, whether it be something as simple as Sonya visiting Celica at her new post, or something as complicated as Celica visiting the new witch of Nuibaba’s castle. \n\nPotential prompts:\n\nPost game dungeoning: how they interact together, faced with endless peril and endless witches. The post game dungeons are so dire, and relentless in their tragedy, I’d like to see how they hold up, and potentially support each other in that.\n\nDiscussions on how they relate to family, in general-- maybe this is set post game, right before Sonya leaves on her quest. Maybe this is set right before the final battle. Either way, an almost-honest talk between them would be great. \n\nPost-game, Sonya’s ending. It’s such a ripe ending for fix-its or playing it straight, and I’d love to see Celica involved in it. Does she help out Sonya, after nearly becoming a witch herself? Does she only get involved after rumors surface of a new and powerful witch in Nuibaba’s castle? Either way, I’d love to see the story. \n\nIntrospection! I feel like Sonya is a strong POV character, in that she has a lot of lived experience that ties into her perception of the people around her.

When and how did he learn so much about how magic worked? (Did he date a witch? Befriend one? Battle against one?) What was it like for him when he was more tightly integrated into the vampire community? What led him to decide to stop killing humans?\n\nFor Nora, I'd enjoy a peek into her life post-series. How things turn out for her, or the decision to have kids with Josh and concerns that might have arisen from that, or dealing with all of the werewolf wives after their husbands died, maybe?

Do the roads appear on her map--perhaps AFTER she finds them? How are they depicted when they fold space? Why does she forget--or perhaps willfully ignore--the stranger aspects of her journey, like grabby trees and bizarre creatures? Is it because of a specific event? Would acknowledging something is weird make the roads no longer work, and she knows this from previous experience? What does her husband think of her shortcut obsession? Homer told David her husband \"didn't care piss-all\", but was that the truth? If not, why would Homer lie about it? How did he even know the husband's opinion? And then the really big one: just what happens with her and Homer after canon ends??? Perhaps you could tell me about their first adventure.

I'd love a story where he and Natsume work together, or Natsume has to call his name for a daring rescue! Perhaps from Matoba's clutches? Or even a quiet moment with some touching dialogue between him and Natsume. Or you could go AU and have Misuzu ask for his name back, at last! What would cause him to want it returned? Could it be to protect Natsume? Can he change form, like Nyanko-sensei? (Perhaps turn into a pony-sized version of himself? Or take full human form??)\n\nFor Natsume Takashi himself, I admire how he's come to trust his friends over the many months of canon time. When he admitted he can see ayakashi to Tomura and Taki, I choked up. He's even opening up a little to his \"muggle\" friends Nishimura and Kitamoto, much to my delight. ^^ Natsume is so gentle and kind, trying to help ayakashi and having to learn the hard way that not all of them are good. (The opposite lesson he had to learn about humans: not all of them are cruel. Interesting.) I would love a fun ayakashi-centered adventure that could be canon. Or you could explore his friendships! I rather like his odd relationship with the guy from one of his foster families, Shibata Katsumi--the playboy in love with the dying flower youkai. I didn't have enough character slots to nominate him, but I would enjoy more interaction between him and Natsume! (And feel free to slash it up. *eyebrow waggle*) If you're feeling ambitious, you could do a future AU with grown!Natsume still returning names and trying to help ayakashi. Or perhaps Natsume could travel to Tokyo and deal with a city ayakashi and exorcists? Just how would <i>that</i> go? \n\nNishimura Satoru. I admit, when it comes to this guy, I'm pretty shallow! XD He's so obsessed with girls, and he expresses so much dismay whenever he thinks Natsume might have a girlfriend. The slasher in me can't help but see that he has a <i>massive</i> crush on our beautiful and ethereal Takashi. Nishimura is chasing skirts as overcompensation, and his dismay over the girlfriends is jealousy--of the women! X3 Nishimura is so outgoing and bouncy, what could make him keep quiet about his attraction? How would Natsume react if Nishimura did express that interest? Natsume seems rather indifferent to romance so far, would that continue? Or how about a quiet pre-slash moment between the two, with Nishimura just so happy to have some quality time alone with his true love? ^^ I realize this is very much a rare pair, so Nishimura is an \"OR\" character request. If you can't fit him into your story, I don't mind. C:\n\nShigure and Jun's chapter in the 2nd volume of the manga really touched me--particularly since Jun really does move away at the end!! *sniffles* Please write about their next meeting! Does Shigure seek Jun out in her new town? Does Jun return as an adult to find Shigure and help him? Can they only see each other in dreams? Can Jun see other ayakashi--and how does that affect her life and their relationship?

The film overlooks it somewhat but their interactions in the novel were my main source of delight, the curious balance of bickering and respect. Neither character knows much kindness in their life; I like to think they’d find that in each other, sort of kindred spirits.\n\nI’ve requested Sayuri and Nobu because I’d love more of that relationship in any form. That might be Sayuri appreciating Nobu platonically, or even a full romantic relationship (danna AU?), or choosing or accepting Nobu over the Chairman (post-canon AU?) – or not (how does Nobu feel? Angst!) Anything with a focus on the relationship between these two will fill me with glee – as I said before it doesn’t need to have a happy ending, I just want more.\n\nFor bonus points, this relationship raises all kinds of issues worth exploring: the value of Sayuri’s ability to make her own choices; the restrictions placed on her by her culture, both within the hanamachi and broader Japanese culture; the way Sayuri pins her life’s ambitions to the idea of the Chairman; the physicality of Nobu, in his eyes and Sayuri’s; the circumstances of Nobu and the Chairman, with the former unattached and interested and the latter married and, to Sayuri, distant and unreachable; not to mention the incongruity of mixing notions of Western romance with another culture. An attachment to Nobu casts all these issues in a different light compared to Sayuri’s attachment to the Chairman. There are many reasons why he might be a better choice – and an active choice too, while she’s been on a trajectory towards the Chairman for many, many years without truly questioning it. Perhaps you might show Sayuri changing, growing like she did in the novel, or maybe you could show the wit, kindness and grudging mutual respect when they interact. Don’t be afraid though, I just want these two to be vaguely affectionate towards one another, even gruffly or distractedly – they both need and deserve it.

In particular, I found myself wondering about Apollonia. We see her entirely through Michael’s eyes and I was left wondering who this woman was and how she had changed during those months. Had she changed at all, or simply lost her shyness? How she would have changed more if she’d lived?\n\nI wonder about her relationship with Michael. Did she love him? Why? What did she think of him, and their situation, and what she was getting herself into? Was she aware of it? Why did she marry him, and what did she think her future might look like?\n\nI wonder about the relationship she might have had with her new family. What would Mama Corleone have thought of her new daughter-in-law? What if Apollonia had lived, and they’d returned to New York, and she’d lived in the compound? What place would she find in that family, in that life, in that country?\n\nWhat were her hopes, her ambitions? Every girl has them – what were hers? Did they change as her situation changed, did she see a way up or a way out or was she on the path she wanted all along?\n\nIn short, I have a lot of questions about Apollonia. For all that I’ve phrased this as a series of questions about her, it would be just as interesting to read a fic from the perspective of another character contemplating or observing her – I would just love to fill in the Apollonia-shaped blank space in my imagination.\n\nLetter: http://sobriquett.tumblr.com/post/166191277013/dear-yuletide-author-2017\n\n\n"

She's more than a pretty girl with a conscience. More than that one moment in the locker-room where she did something she could never take back no matter how hard she tried. I really wish they'd shared more moments. A conversation, a look, a thought, anything. I love how the book is set-up in the aftermath of the incident and that the town's destruction is covered widely by the media and argued about at academic levels. I also like that the use of Carrie's powers has a real effect on her body and mind. Going deeper into either of those things or showing their effects on a Carrie and Sue that lives in the end would be amazing.

The degree to which she's proven wrong in this evaluation is up to you.\n- Several years in the future after the game's conclusion, when the Lone Wanderer has faded into obscurity/settled down in Megaton/etc, Amata has to reach out to the LW once again because (reasons). Now that they're both real adults, instead of teens forced into positions of leadership too soon, maybe her perspective has changed and there are opportunities for reconciliation? It'd be especially interesting to read something that doesn't gloss over how difficult that would be for both of them. All of the resentment and envy and residual deep affectionate feelings, please.\n- Amata cares about protecting people and maintaining order for the greater good. I could see her getting along well with either Sarah or Paladin Cross, and I'd love to see your take on interactions between them.\n- Mentor/mentee dynamics within the Brotherhood (Paladin Cross-Sarah, or between either of them and the Lone Wanderer)?\n- A star-struck Lone Wanderer nursing a giant crush on either one of these powerful military women, especially before winning Sarah's respect.\n- I'd love to read something that looks at Paladin Cross' experiences with her cyborg body. She doesn't eat or sleep anymore--what's that like?\n- What are Sarah and Cross' daily interactions at Brotherhood high command like? Have they served together in the line of duty? I'd love to read some pre-FO3 mission fic involving daring feats of bravery and intense ~battle feelings~.\n- Something bouncing off of Sarah's comment in Broken Steel about wanting to get to know the LW better. I'm not sure what the dating life of a Brotherhood Elder would look like, but something where she's trying to fit some romance in with all of her duties running a military organization in the post-apocalypse would be so fun to read.\n- Maybe Paladin Cross comforts the LW after the death of James? Especially if it's a sort of stoic, knightly, unspoken comfort. Alternately, maybe the LW is into Paladin Cross but Cross doesn't think it's appropriate because of the age difference/her being a cyborg/etc and so there is a lot of repression and guilty feelings and sublimation into Duty and Service.\n- Fix-it fic where Sarah doesn't die, Maxson doesn't get to take over the East Coast BoS, and the ripple effects of that in terms of what the plot of Fallout 4 might look like? Paladin Cross was the advisor to Sarah's father, so something about her time as Sarah's second in command would also be really interesting.\n- I could go on, but basically: warrior women/women in command positions doing cool things and/or having Feelings. Post-apocalyptic day-to-day life. Canon divergence AUs. These are all things that I love.\n\nGeneral likes, etc in letter!\n\nLetter: http://lieu.dreamwidth.org/14337.html\n\n\n"

I would love to see some of the interiority of a cyborg space marine in their day-to-day life, or something that plays with what it means to be an AI consciousness instead of an organic being--I never get bored of this kind of thing.\n- I love the idea that the Security Officer is just mildly bemused by all of the wackiness that goes on around them, but maybe they're totally freaking out the whole time? Either direction is intriguing. I would love to see someone do something where the Security Officer can actually respond to all of Durandal's nonsense. Terminal banter!! (Terminal flirting??) On the other hand, I also love the idea of the Security Officer as an actual silent protagonist, if you want to run with that. Basically, what is going on in the Security Officer's head?\n- Relatedly, why exactly is the Security Officer so amenable to being Durandal's willing minion? I just really love loyalty kink, and this canon has it in spades. So yeah. Have at it.\n- There have been so many amazing explorations of Durandal's interiority, but I'm always in search of even more, because I absolutely love him as a character in ways that are hard to articulate properly. Does he write the terminal entries for his own sake? What is the interior monologue of a rampant AI? I'm also intrigued by the theories that hold that Durandal was actually able to achieve metastability at some point in M2 or M:I, but was lying about it Because Reasons, so if you wanted to take that possibility and run with it I'm very curious to see where you could end up.\n- What would happen if the Security Officer got woken out of cryosis early because of the ship crash landing somewhere/some kind of malfunction (possibly resulting in Deep Space Hijinks)? Or what if they weren't put in cryosis for those seventeen years of transit in the first place? To be a fly on the wall of that ship...\n- Or, give me all the really silly tropey sci-fi/space opera crack played straight. Getting into some situation where you gotta marry your AI because of wacky alien customs?? Flimsy sci-fi excuse for bodysharing, with Durandal having to be uploaded into some cyborgian chip in the Security Officer's cortex Because Reasons??? Or maybe some kind of scenario where the Security Officer has to pilot some kind of giant robot in the fight against the Pfhor, with Durandal as the thing's AI (leading to some Evangelion/Pacific Rim-esq mech-suit mindmelding with optional body horror??). I love sci-fi tropes and there's so much fun you can have thinking about the ways a technologically advanced super-soldier and a rampant AI could end up interacting.\n\nGeneral likes, etc in letter!\n\nLetter: http://lieu.dreamwidth.org/14337.html\n\n\n"

I'm also into just getting more of what we got in canon: bickering brother-coworkers who are each other's only source of familiarity, stability, and emotional intimacy even as their actual relationship is fraught with resentment, manipulation, and long-held grudges. Like always, my favourite thing to read is moments of familiarity and even tenderness between violent and terrible characters. Don't shy away from how fucked up their relationship is, but I think it's also important to take into account some of the lightness and ease to it, as well, since the tension between those two tones is part of what makes the book work, IMO.\n- I want pre-canon murder hijinks like burning. Casefic about past jobs? Snapshots of their early life, when they were just getting started as killers? Their first brush with the Commodore, and how they got themselves hired?\n- I love the Pacific Northwest gothic/magical realist elements of the story, like the cabin witch's \"curse\" and the creepy intermission with the girl and the dog. I'd love to see a writer do something with that: not so much try to \"explain\" it, because I think part of the charm is how inexplicable and bizarre those episodes are, but run with it within your piece. Or write, like, some kind of magic AU where these are cowboy hitmen with witchy powers or something. Really just go for it, I will read anything.\n- What happens after that ending? Does Charlie ever become more like his old self again, and does his personality change for better or for worse? Does Eli get to open up his store? How does Eli fare as the brother-in-charge, at last? Does anyone ever find them out for bumping off the Commodore? How do things go with their mother?\n- Feel free to do some funky things with formatting/formal characteristics, if the mood strikes you, since the book has all those weird intermissions, font changes, and lapses into journal-writing and monologues from other characters. If you feel like writing some epistolary or even weird neo-Western IF, go for it.\n\nGeneral likes, etc in letter!\n\nLetter: http://lieu.dreamwidth.org/14337.html\n\n\n"

Utopia Season 2, Episode 1 is my alley.\n- The contrast between Carvel and the Assistant in terms of the roles they play in Milner’s life fascinates me—Carvel is this godlike figure she’s in love with but also keeping captive, in certain senses, and for all their deep emotional connection they also fear and distrust each other, whereas the Assistant is this mundane, almost invisible presence who nonetheless occupies a space of closeness and intimacy in Milner’s life that almost exceeds Carvel’s. He has keys to her house! He’s the only one we hear call her “Letan”! I need the Milner-Assistant origin story like burning. How did they meet? What were they to each other before Carvel and Janus and “your loyalty breaks my heart”?\n- Milner is one of my favourite characters of all time and I sorely need more of her, in whatever way! Was she telling the truth about having been in a genocide, and if so, in what capacity? For his part, how did the Assistant lose his name? Who was he? What do people like Tom think his deal is?

Cold war spy hijinks! Undercover as lovers while attending some ballroom dance function in order to steal state secrets! Threatening bureaucrats in the back rooms of supper clubs! You know, all the minutia of leading a shadowy biowarfare conspiracy while also being normal spies on the side.\n- More of their weirdly domestic and familiar brand of co-villaining, in general. I love coworkers, and I extra love coworkers in secretive cultlike organizations.\n- Explicitly shippy or not is fine, I just want something like the ambiguous mastermind-and-devoted-right-hand dynamic we get in canon.

The exceptions would be coffeeshop and high school AUs, which I'm really not a huge fan of. You'll frequently find me browsing the \"Everyone Lives/Nobody Dies\" tags in applicable fandoms where denial is the safest treading ground. Casefics always draw my interest immediately, and if there's a compelling plot with a strong background ship/romance in it, I'm generally happier and more excitable than a hummingbird in a greenhouse. I love reading about women being awesome, even though some of the fandoms I've requested don't necessarily lead to that naturally. I love the 'hero in distress' trope, with a loved one flying into the rescue and big mushy reunion. I dig hurt/comfort like no one's business because I am secretly a marshmallow. I also love \"for want of a nail\" situations, in which one small change leads to huge consequences throughout the canon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThings I'm not a fan of would include noncon/dubcon (including sex pollen), ABO dynamics and associated tropes, aforementioned high school/coffeeshop AUs, mpreg (excluding AFAB pregnancies), death fics, unwarranted or irrational jealousy, partner betrayal/cheating, fake/pretend relationships, or prolonged misunderstandings. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do want to let you know that, if you're inclined to write gen, or dislike any of the prompts/pairings, I certainly do not have a problem with it. I want you to enjoy Yuletide as much as possible - it's that season! So if any of these prompts inspire you, then by all means - run wild. If not, then I'll be just as happy to see what inspires you about the fandoms! I'm super easy to please, and I want you to have the best possible Yuletide and holiday season!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor Lethal Weapon specifically: \n\nI would be happy with gen, but if you wanted to go somewhere with Trish/Riggs/Murtagh that'd be awesome too. \n\nRiggs is a sad marshmallow I want to wrap in cotton and love. I would love to see him slowly building a family with the Murtaghs. Or casefic in which he and Murtagh grow increasingly closer. Maybe Murtagh getting a new appreciation for him or seeing him in a different light. Maybe Murtagh saying something completely awful and then regretting it, and slowly finding a way to make up for it. I'd love to see Trish calling Murtagh out and being her badass self.\n\n\n"

If you wanted to include the other characters in the movie, that would be absolutely fine by me - I would just really love to have Faraday/Vasquez as the main focus.\n\nIf you were inclined to write a modern AU, I'd love something involving them in law enforcement of any stripes. Or, as a twist, Joshua as the conman and Vasquez as the pursuer.\n\nShould you enjoy writing canon-era, I'd love to see your interpretation of what might happen should a bounty hunter come after Vasquez, and how they're dealt with.\n\n\n"

Hell, if you just wanna retell the clones discovery triggered by different events keeping everything else the same, I think that would be great too. Another opportunity for weirdness would be getting a woke Bell party going: for whatever reason, Bell wakes up a handful of clones. And boy are they a handful. How do they keep each other apart?

	"prompt": "This is one of my favorite short stories, because it packs a massive punch in very few words, and is quite literally about one of my favorite subjects: humans wanting to fuck aliens. It’s a pretty brutal skewering of scifi machismo and critical of period-typical racism (there is one use of a racial slur by an unsympathetic character). What I want here is worldbuilding/exploration, which is why I didn’t nominate any characters. \n\nHere’s my favorite excerpt: “We’ve hit the supernormal stimulus. Man is exogamous—all our history is one long drive to find and impregnate the stranger. Or get impregnated by him; it works for women, too. Anything different-colored, different nose, ass, anything, man has to fuck it or die trying. That’s a drive, y’know, it’s built in. Because it works fine as long as the stranger is human. For millions of years that kept the genes circulating. But now we’ve met aliens we can’t screw, and we’re about to die trying. . . .” \n\nIt’s such a deeply colonialist statement, and like all Tiptree’s best work, it’s possible to take it uncritically. Yeah, humanity wants to go out and fuck things and we’ve found the unfuckable and now we’re all gonna die, fuckless. But actually, it’s such a good swipe at hypermasculine scifi. There’s also a criticism of the fear of miscegenation and immigration, presenting it as fruitless and perverted. Another theme that comes up is homophobia, as the engineer fearfully recalls that it didn’t matter that the Yyeir was male. \n\nI’d love to read a deconstruction of this, exploring what Tiptree started - perhaps the perspective of one of the aliens on humans? You could follow the newsman as he gets to meet aliens for himself. Or what if the story was set in 2017? (Please no references to the current political horror story, though) You could also write a story exploring the direct setting: alien sex addiction. What really would happen if humanity became obsessed with fucking aliens and no longer wanted to reproduce itself? How would the world end? You could also reset the story in a number of historical settings, which would be fascinating. Aliens and Genghis Khan? Aliens and Anglo-Saxons? Aliens arrive at Cusco before the conquistadors? \n\nI’m also totally down with Original Female Alien/Original Female Human or Original Male Alien/Original Male Human. What sort of cultural and sexual difficulties do they have? Do they end up having to tragically part ways, or are they able to stay together? \n\nDo not wants: \n\nAUs (i.e. mundane, modern, gender, magical, etc.), except for canon divergence and ones specifically requested.\nKids. Babies. Pregnancy of any sort in anyone. Infantilization.\nUnrequested crossovers and fusions.\nCancer.\nNoncon and underage. Domestic abuse.\nBDSM and D/s.\nPolyamory/OT3s.

You're living in total darkness under crushing pressure, without even the sweet release of early death.  \n\nI want any and all fic about these critters.

Does it wonder when the eating will stop? Does it miss its eyesight, or does it even notice that it's lost a sense? And how does the copepod feel? Does it wish it had a more exciting host (does it know there are more exciting hosts?) or does it have a sincere love for the shark? Do Greenland sharks, when they reach sexual maturity at age 150, experience love? \n\nDoes a hagfish have dreams above its station - like, does it ever think it would like to try fresh whale over decaying whale, but is sad that it’s not strong enough to swim to the upper layers of the ocean, and also it’s blind and full of snot? Perhaps you could write the POV of the decaying whale, and how it loves the community it feeds. \n\nMaybe there really were three giant isopods eating Doritos on someone’s floor. How did the isopods get there? Maybe Giant Isopods have their own advanced society under the ocean and we just haven’t found it yet. Perhaps a Giant Isopod decides to explore the surface, and becomes a celebrity. \n\nOr for another angle, who was the first person who ate Greenland shark and got wasted on sharkmeat? Were they then obsessed with the mystery of how to make the shark more edible? Consider: Greenland sharkmaids. Greenland shark selkies. I’m actually completely serious that I would love an F/F romance involving a Greenland sharkmaid and a scientist. Or maybe a romance between an male Icelandic bartender and a male Greenland shark selkie, after the bartender accidentally makes hakarl out of the shark selkie’s discarded skin and now he’s got a houseguest with an extremely low metabolism, bad eyesight, and memories of the 18th century. You could also reverse the gender setups of either these scenarios, as long as there is no M/F. \n\nGeneral do not wants: \n\nAUs (i.e. mundane, modern, gender, magical, etc.), except for canon divergence and ones specifically requested.\nKids.

Etc. etc. You could tell me stories about spider libraries, or spider sports, or spider university – pretty much anything. Or how spider civilization changes after contact with the humans and they try to adapt so that they can live side by side.\nI also loved how the worldbuilding was always combined with stories about characters we already kind-of knew and how they were always similar but at the same time different, especially the relationships between them. I liked all the Portias and Fabians and Biancas, and I loved how Portia and Fabian's relationships varied from betrayal to self-sacrifice. Feel free to use any of them that we already know and expand on their stories, or to come up with your own versions.\nIf you want to write about the humans, the time right after first contact and the first generation of the two species living together interests me the most. It would also be interesting to look at the different reactions of e.g. those who never woke up after they left Earth, Key Crew, and the Tribe.

I loved the characters, with their distinctive thought processes, their relationship dynamics, and the banter.  I loved how everyone wound up after the necromancer-villain without even being entirely sure how it happened.  \n\nI have also read the Element of Fire and the Fall of Ile-Rien, so if you want to incorporate those stories too, feel free.  \n\nNicholas was a fascinating viewpoint character - his brand of cold logic layered over deep emotion (which seemed to mostly be vengefulness, but occasionally softer emotions too) made for very interesting motivations.  He was just so ruthless - his utter occasional utter incomprehension of more compassionate/forgiving social norms and emotions was pretty hilarious to me.\n\nGentleman Reynard Morane's core of honorability fit so oddly into the criminal underworld, but at the same time he really did manage to belong there.  He's got a deep, fascinating history as a brave man and also a very dangerous one, and his blend of cynicism and idealism make for a great character.  I'd love to see more of his past, maybe while he was still in the army, or perhaps how he settled in with the Queen's guard after the book ends.\n\nMadeline's determination to be a stellar actress in spite of her successful criminal sideline was one of my favorite things about one of my favorite characters.  I loved Madeline's practicality, and how whenever Nicholas got too wrapped up in things she could bring him down.  I loved her contentious relationship with her grandmother, and how clearly they respected each other's determination even if they didn't understand each other's goals.\n\nI am also incredibly fond of Arisilde.  He's a gentle person with a lot of anger, and I really respected how he made a conscious choice to not indulge in overt, destructive revenge in favor of spectacular, self-destructive revenge.  I would love to hear about his early education, his friendship with Edouard, or even about Isham finding him.\n\nAs for Ronsarde, I'd love to hear about some of his old cases with Doctor Halle, especially the ones where he was chasing Donatien.  Or why Ronsarde knew the queen personally, or perhaps how he's handling aging and still trying to hunt criminals.  Does he take Nicholas as a sort of successor?  That would be a clash of personalities and ideals worth seeing, although it would likely have to be a sort of stealth mentorship since Nic would probably never agree to it.\n\nIdea Prompts:\nI really want to know about that What If story where Nicholas's family hadn't quite managed to disinherit themselves from the throne of Ile-Rien and he was forced to marry the queen.  Was Nic's prediction that he and the queen could have conquered the world correct?  Would the queen have gotten rid of Madeline?  Would Madeline have dueled (or assassinated) the queen, or would Madeline have killed Nicholas instead?  More terrifyingly, what if Madeline and the queen got along?  Is Tremaine now the Crown Princess, and if so, how has that effected her?  She probably didn't spend most of her life pretending to be stupider than she is - or maybe she still did, if she's not the oldest or if she's not somehow related to the queen...  And how does the court handle the new royal power couple?  Nic was extremely wary of her majesty after only meeting her once, which was probably gratifying for the queen after so long being disregarded by her court.  Actually, I have to assume that the court would be underestimating them both right up to the point where they'd step over the twitching bodies of their enemies and people <i>still</i> wouldn't know how it happened.  What would Reynard and Ronsarde think about the whole thing?\n\nI would also love to read about Nicholas and company building up Donatien's reputation, in the early days.  Or why exactly did Nicholas come up with the Donatien persona in the first place?  Or, when Madeline joined Nic's criminal empire, it was already well underway.  Did she have any difficulties fitting in with the rest of the group, and if so, how did she handle them?\n\nOr I'd love to know about Dr. Halle's thought process in deciding to throw his lot in with Madeline when Ronsarde was dragged into the prison.  Why did he think it was a good idea?  Had he and Ronsarde worked with criminals before?  When did he recognize Madeline?  \n\nHere's some commentary from the author with link to a legal and free online copy: http://marthawells.livejournal.com/552315.html\n\nLetter: http://slowmercury.livejournal.com/10200.html\n\n\n"

The humor never rings false, from the slapstick - often provided by Saracen - to the wordplay, to the surreal events of the books.\n\nMosca Mye is practical, savvy and resourceful; she's a very smart protagonist who still manages to seem like a believable kid.  She's often unkind but her determination to go her own way and her streak of hidden idealism keep her sympathetic.  She's very cynical for a twelve year old - she never manages to accept kindness at face value without looking for the strings.  What, in her life before the series started, makes her that way?  Did she learn this attitude, or is it simply part of Mosca's personality?  Really, the only being she seems to trust unconditionally is Saracen.  \n\nEponymous Clent is another great character.  He's an obvious swindler who nevertheless has enough morals to try and look out for Mosca's best interests, in a sideways sort of way.  He does try and dump her on random people, but I always had the impression that in addition to not wanting to be bothered with a kid and dangerous goose, he also believes that it's truly to her benefit to <i>not</i> be involved in his life of crime.  Speaking of which, Clent has got an impressive rap sheet.  What were some of the circumstances of those crimes?  Or are there any really impressive crimes he's committed that he got away with, because no one pinned it on him?\n\nIdea Prompts\nWhat are some of the places Mosca and Clent visit?  What sort of mischief do they get into?  Do they continue to con their way across the continent, leaving angry folk behind them wherever they go?  Maybe they ran a particularly elegant scheme somewhere - Clent's swindling experience paired with Mosca's practicality makes a fabulous grifting team.  Do they topple any other regimes?\n\nWhat does Saracen think of his new life on perpetual road trip?  What things/people/animals has he conquered, since leaving home?\n\nMosca is offered a place with the Locksmiths, and she manages to turn it down without insulting the Locksmiths enough to make unnecessary enemies, but the implication is that they're going to ask her again one day and they're going to expect a different answer that time.  How will that turn out?  Maybe Mosca refuses to join, and she and Clent start a subversive, creative revolution.  Maybe Mosca does join, and when she inevitably ends up in charge she changes the Locksmiths Guild to suit her own ends.  Maybe Mosca and Clent are quick enough that the Locksmiths never catch them again.  I'd love to hear what you think could happen!\n\nOr tell me what happened in Mandelion or Toll-By-Night after Mosca, Saracen and Clent departed.  Life is very obviously very altered; how are people coping?\n\nOr give me some world building about the Beloved!  They're such a large presence in the books, but we only hear bits and pieces about the individual ones.  I want to know about their histories - when and how and why they were adopted by the now fractured realm.  I want to hear about the Beloveds' jobs, about what names are associated with which Beloved - I want to know what stories get told about them, and how many Beloved there are.\n\nLetter: http://slowmercury.livejournal.com/10200.html\n\n\n"

It feels dangerous, half brightly lit and half shadow - it's desperation and wealth side by side.  Why is the city still such a mess?  What's gone wrong in the days since the first Batman, and how did the city react to his initial disappearance?\n\nPart of the reason I enjoyed this series so much was the relationship between Terry and Bruce.  Bruce has more experience and he's the boss, and Terry respects that, but at the same time Terry is Batman and he ultimately goes his own way whenever he thinks it's necessary.  \n\nI like Bruce.  He's a bitter old man who thinks he knows better than everyone else, and Terry coming into his life must have been like waking up again.  Terry is the only person we see on the show who ever stands up to him successfully, and it's good for a person to have an equal, even if that equal is actually in high school.  (Max and Barbara tried, during the course of the series, but neither of them quite pulled it off.  I'd love to see a story where they did, though.)\n\nI really like Terry, too.  He's tough, and occasionally selfish, and deeply kind and generous.  He looks after his friends and his family and his city.  In some ways, I think Terry is better at being Batman than Bruce was, because he listens to other people and he lets them help him.  Terry also truly values his family and friends -  he cares more about work/life balance than Bruce did, which result in Terry trying to take better care of himself than Bruce used to.\n\nMax is wonderful, too.  I love her friendship with Terry, and how even after she finds out about the whole Batman thing, she refuses to let herself be intimidated by either of them.  I'd like to see more of her relationship with her family, particularly her sister.  \n\nFinally, I would have liked to see more of Dana in the cartoon.  I thought she was underutilized, which was a shame.  She seems to manage being compassionate but not a doormat well, and I think Terry is lucky to have her.  For a damsel in distress character type, she's actually pretty well rounded.  I'd love to see a story where Terry tells her the Batman secret of his own volition (although her finding out somehow, or figuring it out would be very cool, too).  \n\nPrompt Ideas\nI'd like to read: Bat investigations, maybe in the high school; Bruce and Terry fighting or working together like a well-honed machine or Bruce and Terry fighting <i>and</i> working together like a well-honed machine; Max and Terry being friends and covering for each other - maybe Terry can cover for Max, for once; Terry willingly telling his family or girlfriend that he's Batman; Max looking after Bruce even when he won't admit he needs it, even though it's harder than looking after Terry because at least Terry cooperates\n\nLetter: http://slowmercury.livejournal.com/10200.html\n\n\n"

I would love to see some of versions where the people who didn't do it in the film did do it.  Or even where Mr. Boddy did it.

Or maybe everyone in the film still did it, but they did different murders for different motives.\n\nOr what happened after any of the possibly canon endings?  The FBI came and presumably everyone present had their cover blown in one way or another.  Some of the blackmail victims would be facing worse consequences than others, but all of them should be facing something.  Maybe it's as simple as two of the guests running into each other some day in the future, and they have to pretend they don't know each other.\n\nOr are there any more murders after the end of the film?

What about their relationship when Wadsworth was FBI?  What was Wadsworth's relationship with his wife like?  Did he even have a wife?\nSpeaking of wives people may or may not have, what about Mr. Green's home life?  Does he have a family, or a boyfriend?  If he's not an FBI agent, what does he do in Washington?  If he is an FBI agent, how did he get inserted into the guest list for the evening?\nWhat exactly does Mrs. Peacock sell, and to whom?  And how did Mrs. Peacock come to set up that particular payment plan?\nThere were negatives of at least one of Miss Scarlet's clients and employees in a compromising position.  Did she take those photos of all her clients?  Did she have a sideline in blackmail herself, when she isn't selling secrets, or does she instead take her clients' privacy very seriously because that's better for business?\nDid Professor Plum's entry into the field of psychiatry rather than, say, surgery have anything to do with his inability to (most of the time) living people from dead ones?  Maybe he's had that kind of mix-up before.\nWhere is Yvette actually from?  How did she go from working for Miss Scarlet to Mr. Boddy?  Did it happen a different way in every different version?\nWhat about the rest of the staff, and the rest of the victims?  What were their lives like before the dinner party?
