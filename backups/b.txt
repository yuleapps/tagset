Scarecrow and Mrs. King 
Lee Stetson

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I have many fond memories of this show, and completely adore Lee and everyone else! I’m really open to any kind of story for this fandom. Some examples of what I'd like to read are: a gen spy story, where something goes badly, maybe with Lee (and Amanda) and his (OC?) nemesis? Or a romance-focused story, maybe exploring Lee and Amanda’s relationship? Or else a slash story, for example Lee's former nameless male partner, that could happen to have been also his lover? I'd love a fix-it where he turns up to be alive, and Lee rescues him. Was he gotten captured and kept prisoner for some years? Was he brainwashed to have him betraying his country? Maybe the demise of his partner makes Lee aware of having been harbouring romantic feelings for him, and then the death man turns up alive and well and this forces Lee to deal with his feelings? I'd love an happy ending. Or a get-together, about Lee with a male spy, or counterspy. Or a dark fic where Lee gets kidnapped and tortured, maybe Lee’s old enemy is so obsessed with him that he kidnaps Lee to force him to ‘love’ him, with old-fashioned love potions, or having non-con sex with Lee while keeping him tied to the bed? 

About other dark routes, I’d love either Lee recovering after a (long?) kidnapping &amp; rape/torture/forced addition ordeal, or any other angsty situation. I love hurt/comfort with hurt Lee. I’d really like if there’s a sub plot with Lee getting together with a Russian agent or Amanda, but it is optional.

If my plot suggestions, or the prompt list here below, don’t work for you, I’d be thrilled also with a different story.

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Survival story. They are stranded on a desert island? Post WWIII survival story? OC finds and rescues Lee who was left to die on the desert?
• Lee &amp; his Russian nemesis team-up against their Governments to prevent WWIII?
• Mission together: maybe they get paired together just for the mission at hand and end up to like each other?
• Undercover as gay/couple, maybe it makes them realize/admit to like each other?
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Awkward situations
• Competent characters with agency
• Loyalty, Trust
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Lee gets kidnapped and brainwashed or tortured
• OC, or Russian spy, or Amanda takes him to his home to rescue/hide him?
• Any rating! Teen rated and focus on feelings is great, focus on feelings and some porny action to back it up is also great!
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•Consensual, dub-con, non-con, are all good with me. Yes to: vanilla smut, all the kinks, dub/non-con tropes like undernegotiated kinks, sex pollen, AMTD, they’re imprisoned and and one of them gets gangraped while the other is forced to watch, and so on
•Semipublic sex, awkward sex in uncomfortable places, lazy anal sex in more proper places
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Hurt/comfort: while sick fic is my least favorite kind of H/C fic I love H/C, I’d always be reading H/C stories, please more of it! ;)
• Watching over Lee while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Training ends up with sexy times.
• Sex bets stories
• BDSM, maybe with sub!Lee?
• R&amp;R or vacation together
• Marooned: for my m/m requests, the ship that find him/them is a cruise ship with only LGBT passengers
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on
• They meet each other while… on vacation at the same location! Or one character saves other character’s life, while pretending to be in vacation?
• Lee got hurt and is recovering when he is ordered to teach at the academy(?) for the duration of his recovery, other character is his student
• Genderswapped Amanda? I’d love to read an alternative take about her as a divorced dad with two children, when Lee meets her (him). :)

How the West Was Won (TV) 
Frank Grayson (How the West Was Won), Luke Macahan

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I love this show so much! I really enjoyed the portrayal of the old US setting, it had to me a flavor of realism and honest research behind the scenes that I haven’t often found in other shows or movies with similar setting. I love how they also handled situations and characters, as a means to explore the cultures and culture clashes of the people native to the places and the ones recently settled there. 

I absolutely love some of both the main cast and recurring characters, though my favorites are the ones I’ve requested, their dynamic, both smart and world-wise guys at a young age, the bad patch the two of them started off with. I love that Luke had to brave through one rough situation after the other! I love that the initial circumstance – Curt’s death – that brought Frank and him to meet each other made them enemies, and yet they ended up to be on the same side and trust each other eventually. I’d be happy with either a fic going on from there, making them becoming tight friends, then if you write slash, I'd also love if you eventually become lovers (I love tropes like enemies to friends to lovers, and enemies to lovers). Or else I’d be happy with a divergent canon story, maybe one that explore a different first meeting and get together instead of Curt’s death, that maybe bring them on different life paths too? Like for example, Frank not becoming a gun for hire, or Luke a wanted criminal; or maybe they are both those things but together they turn to a different path?

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p
• Mission together
• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty
• Spy story, case fic, with foreground or background relationship?
• Undercover as partners in crime, maybe it makes them realize/admit a mutual attraction?
• Partners on the run, or simply travelling together
• Awkward or embarrassing situations, awkward or frenzied sex, semi-public sex, especially anal sex/intercourse
•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con. It can go with the smutty request here above or standing alone. I always crave more emotional hurt/comfort stories with sexual context too, they are my jam.
• Competent characters with agency
• Possessive feelings or behavior
• Protectiveness
• A character gets kidnapped and tortured, the other character rescues him
• Any rating is cool! So it is consensual, dub or noncon smut.
• First kiss, First time sex, All the first times!
•All the dark scenarios (graphic - like for example medical experimentation, torture, ecc - or conceptual - like dystopia, slavery, ecc)
• Recovery from torture or rape fic, or generally any hurt/comfort fic
• Angst with a happy resolution or hopeful note
• Getting rescued from the noose sentence or the prison by his bondmate/lover/partner
• Sex bets stories
• Undernegoziated spontaneous BDSM, maybe with sub!Luke?
• Watching over Luke while in critical condition, sitting at his bedside
• Fight or gun training ends up with sexy times.
• Building their home together, life in the Old West
• Stuck in a mountain cabin during a blizzard, sharing a bed, and so on.
• They meet each other on a cruise

The Real Ghostbusters 
Ray Stantz (Real Ghostbusters), Winston Zeddemore (Real Ghostbusters)

I do not want:
• Cheating
• Bad endings, character deaths, etc. If it’s dark fic I don’t mind open endings, if it’s other than dark fic please, keep the ending light or hopeful.
• PWP with no setup whatsoever first and/or after the sex, if it’s alright to ask. Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.

I'm also so fond of this show, Ray was my favorite but Winston was a close second, so I'm requesting them together. I'd enjoy many kind of stories, from ghost catching and then celebrating, to more serious stories like the guys having to resolve mundane problems, maybe they need a second job to cover all the expenses and Ray and Winston find a second job that gets them in trouble (take a stab at PI and that brings them to go undercover on a gay club -- and kiss each other to keep the cover?). Or Ray gets hurt in mission and maybe Winston has to patch him up on the spot because they are trapped there for the diration, and so on. But, if you write slash, I'd be really thrilled with slash fic, maybe first time, where Winston and Ray get together, or accidentally have sex and realize feelings, or other shippy scenarios with the two of them. :D

Scenarios that I like:
• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings
• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers
• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p

Conan the Adventurer (Cartoon) 
Wrath-Amon (Conan the Adventurer)

https://bahamut-255.deviantart.com/art/Wrath-Amon-Commissioned-from-ChatonBleu-553381774

https://68.media.tumblr.com/4a94ad23225d9e94e62c5734a93eef75/tumblr_inline_os7r78Vl1S1s5upnl_1280.jpg

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Bereft of the Black Ring of Set, Wrath-Amon has only his cunning, his instincts, his skills, the scales on his back, and whatever he can get a hold of to see him through this 'challenge'.  

2 - Over 200 years of servitude to his detested 'Master;, and every moment spent seeking a means of usurping him.  Now, with orders to Raid a Cimmerian Village for Star-Metal, an opportunity presents itself.  

3 - "And what use would there be to such a thing?  To trade Power, for Vanity?"  

4 - "Barbarian Filth.  You're time has come."  

&nbsp;

The why:  

Wrath-Amon, the one-time Gila Monster Sniffer, remade into a Humanoid Lizardman before becoming Chief Servant of Set when he overthrew his former Master, Ram-Amon.  Which in turn saw him gain a new more human form through the Black Ring's Power so long as he wore it and it remained charged.  

This is a character who is actually relatively deep and complex in a series that had a series-spanning arc, given the design of the series (Saturday Morning Cartoon), with even his own origin episode.  

Wielding immense power through said Ring, yet paranoid about any and all threats - real and imagined - that could cost him what he has.  Commands a vast army and followers, yet they listen to him only out of fear of his own Master, Set.  Takes great pleasure in bringing suffering to others (most notably with the draconic Windfang), while despising his own past, his own origin, what he really is.  In fact, the one time he allowed himself to revert to a lizardman (then lizard) was the one time that his own life was dependant on it.  

AUs are a favoured theme of mine, taking what's in the series, picking out a POD and making a new world out of it.  From the small, to fate-twisting, to full-on mirrorversing (especially when the characters are still recognisably themselves).  

As for themes?  Well, Action/Adventure is preferred, though given the setting, Fantasy is good as well.

&nbsp;

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - With the hand of Princess Yasimina in his own, Zamora was now, his.  

2 - Casting his gaze across the marble gardens, his cold slitted eyes locked on their target, already moving towards it.  

3 - A shame that the Boy had to die, but he had other matters to attend to.  

&nbsp;

The Why:  

Thulsa Doom, as a character, while not completely faithful to the works of REH, is still an impressive one in his own right.  One who seems obsessed with collecting as much power to himself as he can.  Hence why (in my opinion) he put an end to his days as a marauding warlord and reinvented himself as a religious demigod, commanding thousands of followers who would leap to their own deaths at his quietest command.  

The links shown at the beginning show him in the form I like the most, snake-headed, serpent-man - which the novelisation of the movie stated clearly he was, the movie being far more ambiguous with regards to just what he was - and I would prefer that that be his primary form.  

While there was a good deal of information given to the viewer, some of which was actually quite subtle and so miss-able on a first viewing, there's still plenty to speculate about.  After all, just how he established the Cult of Set isn't explained, nor how it spread so far, so fast.  

But it does tell me the sheer power and influence Thulsa Doom wields, having achieved so much in so little time, perhaps enough that he can safely show his snake head to at least his devout followers which I feel can be a good idea to explore.  

Intellect is something I see in him too.  His idea to marry Princess Yasimina being to legally secure the Zamarian Throne of her Father, Osric: the Usurper, being an example of this.  

One other detail I picked up on was the sheer lack of value he placed on his followers:  The aforementioned compelling them to commit suicide just to prove his Power; Scaling Up thus abandoning Yasimina to save himself when Conan and Co. broke in; Trying to Kill Yasimina when she was lost to him; And clearly placing far more value on his pet snakes as he bluntly stated himself.  A real Villain through and through.  

&nbsp;

Dark Romance, Fantasy.  These are the genres I believe would work here.

Cinderella (2015) 
Lizard Footman 1 (Cinderella 2015), Major (Cinderella 2015)

Preferred Prompts:  

1 - Midnight had passed, the Witching Hour was here.  Already beneath my hat and wig I could see my snout in front of me, my night of freedom fading into memory.  A pair of shoes flying loose ahead of me, the sound of tearing fabric over the rattle of the racing carriage.  

2 - "Why do this to us?  Why did they not even ask?"  

3 - How he kept his hooves and wide rump steady on the shaking, sticky carriage he didn't know, only that Home was in sight, just a few minutes more...

&nbsp;

The Why:  

While there's a good number of Stories in this fandom that give a lot of attention to Cinderella, her step-family, the Royal Family, and others.  There's really very little that give attention to these ones, the ones the Fairy Godmother would change into the coachmen and footmen for Cinderella for the duration of One Night.  For mere hours.  

In fact, other than a Cracked.com Animation and a few exploratory ideas, I can't recall seeing anything that really looks into this.  Hence my desire to see this done.  

And given how little is given, I can see there being a lot of room available for expanding on this idea.  

How do they deal with being made Human, frequently without even being asked?  Knowing that it's only for a few brief hours before the Magic fades, and they're back to their original selves?  

What would they be doing during the time alone?  While Cinderella is with the Prince, and they're waiting by the carriage?  

What would they be thinking at this time?  And during the Race back to Cinderella's Chateau as they slowly, bit-by-bit, return to their real forms?  

Their own dreams, fears, wants, and hopes?  

&nbsp;

I would like it if the Magic takes 60 minutes starting from Midnight (the Witching Hour of sorts) to completely fade, bit-by-bit, as so to allow plenty of time for them to really think about it as they lose their human forms.  

So Drama is a genre I feel would work here - and perhaps a bit of action - but not essential.  

&nbsp;

Everything you need to know about my feels for this is in my letter and no one needs that twice, so I've just copied the prompts for you. They're pretty shippy, but I am 100% enthusiatic about G rated, no sex fic, and if you have some gen shenanigans in mind, I would be up for that also.

1)Everyone turns out to be more gay than they thought: Dominique and Pierre end up together. Rose and Maude end up together. Everyone's happy and nothing hurts.

2)They're a couple (handwavey handwavey) and Pierre wants to be romantic and affectionate like everyone else gets to be, only he can't because he totally poisoned the well on that one during the 'pretend boyfriends' period and now whenever he tries Dominique assumes he's being patronising and sarcastic.

3)When I first watched this film, I genuinely thought that Pierre was bisexual and had been in love with his friend for years, quietly not mentioning it because Dominique clearly had massive issues around that whole area and that over the course of the film Dominique would get over his damn crisis, Pierre would confess, etc etc happy endings. You will fill a tiny hole in my heart if you write this for me.

Green Arrow (Comics) 
Oliver Queen (Green Arrow Comics), Dinah Lance (Green Arrow Comics), Roy Harper (Green Arrow Comics), Connor Hawke (Green Arrow Comics)

Oliver Queen does complicated and emotionally messy. Nowhere does this show up more clearly than in his relationship with Dinah Lance.

Two wounded people who often can’t tell each other what they need, who’ve lived so long with the mask, they’ve forgotten they can take it off.

Tell me a story of them and of the people around them. Tell me a story of them being brave, taking the mask off with each other, not just their clothes. This will be an exception to the no-smut rule, since in canon, bed was often the one place they’d be real with each other.

How does such a revelation (or the lack of one, if that’s the way your Muse bounces) impact Oliver’s sons? How does that change their relationship with him – or does it?

Give me the people-side of this – behind the masks, with the masks. How do the choices they all make affect them and the people around them – both on the hero-ing side and in the general population?

If you're not feeling a story with all four, I'd prefer one that concentrates on Oliver and Dinah.

I have to admit, I’m not as interested in the nighttime here, except as it purr-tains to the day. I’m way more interested in the people themselves than fight scenes. (see DNW list)

Past that, have at it! There are still a million-million stories in this Universe, and so many yet to be written!

Oh, one other quick thing if you would – please remember that Arrows Run Out. ;-D

EDS "Cat Herders" (Commercial) 

It brought me great joy to see this in Yuletide. I’ve loved this commercial ever since I first saw it in its SuperBowl line-up back in the day.

So tell me a story of this world – why are cats herded? Is there a purr-actical reason? Is it religious or have other symbolic significance? Is it a rite of passage, giving prestige to the successful? Why (and how) does someone choose to become a Cat Herder? Or do they get to choose? Are they chosen instead? If so, how?

What is it like from the cats’ points of view? How do they feel about being herded? Are they happy? Content? Resigned? Outraged? Rebellious? 

Anything from this world would be awesome. (Paw-some? :D )

There are depths to our boy – depths that weren’t all explored in canon.

Give me a story of those depths – how he feels, why he does what he does. Either a story from his past, before the show, or one from after the show ends.

How has his life changed over the years? With getting older? With developing a relationship with Amanda King? How has his life changed as the world has changed?

And, something that came to me as I was pondering my Yuletide choices – was that initial exchange really an accident, a desperation move that ended up working out? Or was it planned? Did the Agency have their eyes on Amanda all along?

This was one of my favorite shows back in the day, so any chance to revisit this Universe would be wonderful.

Seeing people succeed against the odds

Overcoming obstacles

stories that look beyond the ‘norms’ and show other ways of life portrayed with respect

respect for all – or as much as you can and still have a story – I know villains gotta villain, and that often involves a powerful amount of disrespect  ;-D 

stories where there is no clear right/wrong – even the heroes have flaws, even the villains have a point

stories that expand my worldview in some way – point out places/people/situations that I didn’t know existed

Quantum Leap 
Al Calavicci

Speaking of hidden depths, the Admiral has them too. 

Tell me a tale – from his past, from the time Sam was in the Bar, something else that attracts you and your Muse – that shows us the passionate, loyal man he is.

Another thought – after the show ends, does he ever tell his wife about how he came back to her? Does she continue to remember the old time-line or does it fade? Does she encourage Al to try and help Sam? Does Al try? Is he successful?

This was another of my fave shows back in the day, so again, any Al-centric story you’d care to write would be most awesome + appreciated.

Progressive Insurance "Flo" Commercials 
Flo the Progressive Insurance girl, Jamie (Progressive)

I’ve been fascinated by the world that is being slowly revealed by these commercials and would love to know more. Any kind of day-in-the-life or other story about how things go and why would be great. 

Or maybe a story from their past – purr-haps the first time Jamie saw Flo and realized that he wanted to be a Progressive Guy as she was a Progressive Gal.

While not nominated and therefore extra-optional, it would be kyool to see about how extra-commercial things like the Progressive-takes-over-the-room phenomenon and how extra-commercial beings like Box fit into the whole scheme of things.

As far as I’m concerned, they don’t make enough of these commercials, so anything you’d care to add to the canon would be wonderful.

I just gotta know – does the Cat ask Kryton for help with his wardrobe-maintenance? Does Kryton say ‘yes’? Getting a mental image of the Cat wheeling in one of his wardrobe-racks on a day that Kryton is ironing and asking him to do.

If not that, any other day-in-the-life story of and about these two would be grand. Does the Cat try to liven up Kryten's life in some way? Does Kryten find some catnip somewhere on board and play a purr-actical joke on the Cat?

Pretty much anything with Maggie being smart and determined and Will being caring and growing.  What was it that caught Maggie's eye about Will?  What was it Will saw in Maggie that he came to care for her?  Because in the first half he's just kind of shell-shocked and along for the ride, but by the second half there's a lot of mutual love and respect there, and I'd love to see it grow.

My Fair Lady (1964) 
Eliza Doolittle (My Fair Lady (1964)), Hugh Pickering (My Fair Lady (1964)), Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady (1964))

I really don't like the pairing canon tries to push on us. I think Eliza and Higgins make great friends, but any kind of romantic or marital relationship between them would be horrible for all concerned. But I love all of the characters as individuals and I love the banter when they're together. So! Ideas, take as much or as little of them as you like, mix and match, whatever. Eliza starts up a business, either a flower shop or a phonetics tutor (if teaching phonetics, bonus points if she uses the "Hungarian Princess" mystique and totally pwns Zoltan Karpathy), while Higgins and Pickering are "confirmed bachelors" together (wink, wink) and Eliza and Mrs. Higgins commiserate. Eliza marries Freddy, because he's a good person despite being brainless, and she likes being adored, and he's good with the kids and she uses his social cachet to keep her business and the whole family afloat, and when his brainlessness gets too much they go and have dinner with the Professor/Mrs. Higgins/Colonel Pickering. Or what about Eliza, Higgins, and Pickering settling down together in a poly relationship, either as a romance or just committed good friends, while Mrs. Higgins sighs because they're happy but it's terribly scandalous, and if any of her friends (or the Bishop!) found out, egads. Or Eliza marries the Colonel because they're good friends and she respects him, and when they're no longer dealing with the training every day and Higgins is a visitor instead of their host and Eliza has a woman friend in Mrs. Higgins, they actually are quite happy and content together. Or Eliza stays with Mrs. Higgins for a while as she's getting on her feet (possibly starting a business?) and Colonel Pickering keeps coming by to smooth things over and ask Eliza back, and he and Mrs. Higgins get together and pair up while the Professor is loudly aghast and Eliza thinks it's awesome. Whatever you choose, banter and humor is the key to this (though I do have an embarrassment squick, so laughing with=good, laughing at=bad).

Random Harvest (1942) 
Charles Ranier | John "Smithy" Smith, Paula Ridgeway | Margaret Hanson

For me, this story cries out either for AUs or for post-canon stories.  What if he hadn't recovered his original memories?  What if he'd remembered, but hadn't forgotten Paula?  What if the baby lived?  What if she'd told him the truth, either right away in the interview for secretary or when he started seeing Kitty or when he asked her to marry him?  What if they'd gotten caught leaving town and he'd had to go back to the hospital?  And if canon stays the same, what happens now that he knows the truth?  Is he upset that she knew and didn't tell him?  Is Charles the same personality as Smitty?  They've both changed and grown a lot over the course of the movie--how does that affect their relationship?  Was she expecting that magically everything would go back to the way it was when they were young and in love?  Was he expecting that knowing the truth would magically make him feel more whole?

Metropolis: The Chase Suite - Janelle Monae 

I love these three albums and the associated art and videos. I don't have any specific prompts or plot bunnies, but here are some things to think about (mix and match as your fancy takes you):

The worldbuilding is exquisite, and makes me hunger for more. We only get a taste of this future. I want to know what makes it tick. I want to know about race relations, and the way human-droid relations map (or don't) onto modern white-black relations. I want to know how the economy works--these droids have some measure of autonomy and money, obviously, DJ Crash-Crash's primary audience seems to be his fellow droids. How does that work, and how did it develop? I want to know about computers and the differences (and similarities) between how droids think and how humans think. I want to know about Cindi's relationship with Anthony Greendown, how it developed and what happened to it once she goes on the run. I want to know about Cindi's relationship to her fellow droids (particularly the other Alpha Platinum 9,000s) and what it means to her (and to them) to be the Archandroid. I want to know about DJ Crash-Crash and his radio show. I want to know about the nightclub Cindi works in in Prime Time. I want to know about all the backstage stuff at the Metropolis Droid Auctions. I want to know more about the insane asylum and how magic, dancing, and technology interact. I want to know about that button at the side of the droids' heads, and what it means that when they push it they turn Black. I want to know more about Cindi's experiences while time traveling. Feel free to explore any or none of these ideas.

Shield of Tomorrow (Web Series) 
Rafael Martinez (Shield of Tomorrow)

My favorite episode so far of this show has been the I Remember episodes where we saw their backstories.  I'd love to see more of young Rafael, before his commission. Other ship assignments, time at the Academy, etc. Bonus points for past boyfriends. Bonus points for recognizable Star Trek characters though this is totally not necessary. I really just want to see more of the young Rafael we saw in his flashbacks. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to write a Sally Ride adventure with the rest of the crew, I love them all. I'd just like it centered on the Captain.

Sagas of Sundry: Dread (Web Series) 
Kayden (Sagas of Sundry: Dread), Tanner Sills (Sagas of Sundry: Dread)

Ideally, I'd love to see interactions with Tanner and Kayden - slash or not, but their dynamic is so explosive and complicated.If that's not your thing I'd like any type of fic centered on either one or the other. What they did in the year between outings, internal monologue, even what they were like before their lives were filled with Dread.  Include any of the other characters that you want (Sat is my least favorite, but I still like her). Fix-it fic that doesn't leave Tanner in the cave is also wonderful.

Galavant (TV) 
Galavant (Galavant), Sidney (Galavant)

The epic adventures of Sir Galavant and his squire before all the pesky business that we got to see. Long travels, drunken nights, maybe something more slashy between them (power dynamic play definitely a possibility here). All with the humor and song (if you feel like writing them singing) of what we know.

Persuasion - Jane Austen 
Anne Elliot (Persuasion - Austen), Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion - Austen)

My favorite Austen, by far. I’m interested in what happened next in whatever form you want that to take. Bonus points for pirates, for Anne kicking ass, for sexy times that involve them being very in love and both of them getting to let go of how controlled they are for a little while. If you're into writing it, there could definitely be some D/s in this pairing.

Oz (TV) 
Ryan O'Reily

Okay, Oz was my very first fandom ever. Before I even knew what slash was, before I knew what fandom was, I snuck this show on the downstairs TV so my parents wouldn’t see me watching it. I loved this show. Ryan was my favorite character of all time, so legitimately anything you write about him would be amazing. Slash him with one of the other boys (preferably Miguel Alvarez) or just show him being a conflicted BAMF. I’ll be happy any way you write him!

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Damen (Captive Prince), Laurent (Captive Prince)

Literally my only gripe with these books is how abrupt the ending is. I want 3 more books about Damen and Laurent's road to ruling and everything they have to go through before they can relax-- because I can't imagine everything is smooth sailing after Kastor and the Regent's deaths, or even once they're crowned and trying to negotiate peace between two countries whose citizens violently hate each other. There are so many questions about what the future holds, and I'd love a story that answers some of them. But I'd be just as happy with fluff as plot-- they deserve it, dammit-- or any combination of the two.

The Wicked + The Divine 
Lucifer (The Wicked + The Divine), Cassandra Igarashi | Urdr

Dark, twisty, intense-- this ship is pure subtext, but boy is it loaded. How long does their association go back; maybe to before Luci became a god? What else happens during The Faust Act that we don't see? I'd love a sneak peek into their relationship, all the intensity and possibility, and what it does to Cassandra when Luci dies. Also, how does that relationship bleed into their godhood? What do a past or future Lucifer and Urdr have to say to each other? As long as they're both always women, I'd be into seeing them in multiple incarnations. Basically I want something that explores all the darkness and beauty and pain that each of them holds in herself, and what is created when those aspects come together.

The Checquy Files - Daniel O'Malley 
Felicity Clements, Odette Leliefeld

The sequel to The Rook didn't disappoint, except that it left Felicity and Odette's relationship sadly hetero-platonic. Dear Yule Fairy, these ladies are MFEO, and I want to read all about it. Make it any genre you want-- action/adventure, where they realize their attraction and feelings while beating up monsters? Office politics, where they become each other's first line of defense against centuries of ingrained prejudice while the two organizations merge? Awkward romcom, where they go on a series of dates that are hilariously bad while they continue to work like a seamless machine in other areas of their lives? All of the above??? The sky's the limit-- just give me my girls being badasses near and for each other, and finally realizing their hopeless attraction.

Basically, anything that focuses on their relationship (spin it platonic, romantic, familial, I do not care) and navigating the complexities of human/android relationships. 

Option 2: I need more about Jacobi and Maxwell’s friendship.

King of Mask Singer (TV) 
Kim Kyung-ho (King of Mask Singer), Shin Bong-sun (King of Mask Singer)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-In episode 87, Shin Bong-sun competed as Father Let Me Be The King but got knocked out in round one. What if she had managed to make it as King though? Would any of the regular panellists have realised who she was, or would they have continued to believe that she was a legendary singer?
-Kim Kyung-ho competed as The Lamp Genie in episodes 59 and 60, but he lost in the final match. What if he had taken the throne instead? Would he have tried behaving more like an idol? How much stick would he end up getting from the panellists and contestants, since it was fairly obvious who he was? Or, what if he goes on the show again and manages to bag the throne on his second attempt?
-Since everyone's got double identities, some kind of superhero/superpower/magical girl AU would be awesome. What if there are some strange goings-on in the studio, and the show is just a front for these magical individuals to gather without raising suspicions? How much do the regular panellists who haven't been contestants on the show before know? Would Kim Sung-joo be aware of these issues as well?

Taskmaster (TV) 
Nish Kumar (Taskmaster), Joe Wilkinson (Taskmaster)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-Nish is definitely one of my favourite ever contestants, so I'd love to read something involving him. I know that Mark Watson wasn't nominated, but I really love the dynamic that he has with Nish, so something with team Wumar would be fun.
-What would a Losers special be like? I'd love to read something involving Roisin, Joe W, Paul, Lolly, and presumably Nish all battling it out to be the least worst of the worst.
-Joe Wilkinson was my favourite out of the series 2 contestants, so if you want to write something with him in instead, that would be brilliant. The show has a history of setting very peculiar tasks, so maybe Joe has to complete one that's so weird his first reaction's along the lines of "really? you want me to do that???" Maybe it's a task that Joe is unexpectedly good at, and he wins the 5 points far more easily than the others? Or would he fail on such an epic level that he gets constantly teased about it?
-I like click and point escape games, and I wouldn't mind reading about a task where the contestants have to get out of a locked room in the Taskmaster house. Would it be a solo effort, or a team task? What if the contestants have to solve extremely bizzare puzzles to get the key? Or what if the puzzles are so straightforward someone gets the feeling they've missed something, like how in the bridge building task in the final episode nobody noticed the three clues pointing to the wood under the table?

Josh Widdicombe (Last Leg RPF)

Hello!

My DNWs: Gender swap, race swap, anything involving pregnancy, character bashing, extreme violence and gore, character death, nothing too angsty please.

Some prompts (see DYA for more info):
-If you want to write a Jalex fic, I'd love something involving a moment from S1E7, about 18 minutes in, when Josh wore a mechanical tail that moved according to his heart rate, and Adam teased him by showing him a picture of Alex to see how the tail would move. What would have happened if Alex had worn the tail? Would he have used the chance to tell the audience he's in love with Josh, or outright exposed the fact they're already in a relationship? How would Josh and Adam react?
-If you want to do Jonnie/Josh fic, that would float my boat too. I've got nothing specific for them, so feel free to write whatever you want.
-If you want to write something else, go ahead. Josh is my favourite, so as long as he's in the fic somewhere, then I really don't mind what I get.

-I'd really love an OT3 fic. If you want to stick to monogamous pairings, any combination works for me. P.S. you are totally free to write a PWP if it gets your fancy ;)
-The opening sketches to Flatslam do form a sort of ship-heavy canon, so I'd love something that's set in their shared flat. I'd also love it if you can work in hypnotist!Matthew somehow.
-They have, in several episodes of PBaM, discussed AUs like post-apocalypse, being stranded on an island, etc. I wouldn't mind if you want to write an AU that's based on those conversations.
-If you want to write something else, feel free!

In a Mass Knife Fight to the Death Between Every American President Who Would Win & Why? - G. Micks 

In the blog post, the author has set up a few rules: they’re in a space based on the Roman Colosseum, FDR has a badass motor wheelchair, etc. The author also details how they believe it went down. I consider these to be suggestions or assumptions, or prompts in their own right. If you want to bring other assumptions to bear, that’s cool.

You can take those rules and write any part of this scenario: the initial scene with a bunch of people, or the final standoff when only a few Presidents are left. You can write up an alliance scene mid-battle, or you can write up a single death. Five things fic is great!

Rush Hour (1998) 
James Carter (Rush Hour), Yan Naing Lee (Rush Hour)

This was the first Jackie Chan movie I ever saw, and it holds a special place in my heart. I love this odd couple who are both so devoted to their job, and eventually, each other (sort of. You know what I mean). I definitely ship these two, but if you don't, that's okay!

Prompts:
* What if Carter and Lee get together? For the first time! Maybe after a particularly tiring case? What's it like? What happens?
* Hurt/comfort? Especially if they just had one of those "oops I accidentally punched you and now your nose is almost broken" scenes?
* Oh no, for this case Carter and Lee need to pretend to be *married!* Surely nothing will come of it and no feelings will be revealed!
* Casefic! What is the next case they need to team up on? (I realize a sequel to this movie already exists, but I give you ultimate freedom to ignore or not as you see fit.)
* It's a heist! Do they need to get something back from the bad guys? Does it involve Carter playing some sort of a role?
* What if one of them invites the other to a family dinner?

They were together on the island for so long, obviously with a rivalry that eventually ended in a very close friendship. Again, I ship these two, but it's more than okay if you don't! 

Prompts:
* We don't actually see them declare a truce. How did that happen? How did they learn to communicate with each other?
* Kong is also in the tagset, and you can feel free to write about an encounter between Kong and Gunpei and Marlow.
* What if Gunpei and Marlow get together? For the first time! (I am a fan of simple tastes.)
* How did they figure out the horrors of the island?
* What were their first interactions with the Tagatu tribe like? Did the tribe take them to be brothers? Lovers? Friends? Dangerous outsiders?
* Take me through what it was like building that boat.
* One of my favorite parts of the movie was the music. Did they teach each other their favorite music? Did one of them teach the other how to dance?

Miss Sloane (2016) 
Elizabeth Sloane, Esme Manucharian

Pretty much anything with these two, ideally in a romantic/sexual context-- essentially my ideal prompt would be "THE MOVIE, BUT GAY." I loved their chemistry and the complexity involved with Liz being a terrible person; how would that play out if there was also an attraction between them? Are they together when Liz outs Esme (and if so, how did that happen?? What was their relationship like?)? Do they have hatesex afterward? Does Esme come visit Liz in prison? What happens between them after she's released? I'd also be fine for gen versions of post-canon prompts that explore their dynamic, whether Esme forgives Liz or gets any kind of closure.

Failing that, I'd also be down for backstory; we know some things about Esme, but what about Liz's life shaped her into the barely-person she is? What if things were different? What is her life like after prison? Really, any kind of character study on either of them would also be great.

Basically any sort of look at what their lives are like after the end of the movie, or any look at what kind of queen Mia ends up being, or even a canon-divergent AU which preserves the initial animosity and belligerent UST between Nicholas and Mia (maybe he's the one she's arranged to marry? or he woos her while concealing the plot to steal her crown?).

Alternately, give me some meta-humor with Rachel the Ladyboss-- how did she achieve her high status? What's a day in her life like? Does she serve as a (hilarious and often on-edge) mentor to young aspiring Ladybosses? Does she ever find the answer to "how much boob is too much boob"?

Wonder Woman (2017) 
Diana Prince (Wonder Woman 2017), Steve Trevor (Wonder Woman 2017)

I would really love straight-up shipfic for this couple.  I found the movie so fun, and the Diana/Steve relationship was delightful and unique, albeit too short.  I’m less interested in the DC universe as a whole (although cameos of other DC characters would be welcome, I’m greatly prefer Diana and Steve to be the focus of any story).  In that vein, what about a modern-day hockey AU, where Diana is the first woman in the NHL, and Steve is the team captain reluctantly fascinated by her?  Or any of the fandom classics - high school AU, reluctant college roommates AU, detectives-working-undercover AU, band AU, you name it.  Alternately, if you wanted to stay a little bit more based in canon, what about a different setup for how the two of them meet: maybe Diana ends up in an arranged or pre-destined marriage with a human?  Anything that gives the two of them more time together or explores their relationship in a different scenario than the movie did is going to be marvelous.

How much do I love Jason and Janet falling in love and getting married FOR ACTUAL FACTUAL REAL in the Good Place?  A lot a lot, that’s how much.  I am utterly charmed by their surprisingly sweet relationship, and fascinated by the oddities of it: show!Janet is a real Good Place Janet, and has such an poignant mixture of knowledge and innocence, and somehow that ends up being a perfect match for Jason, in all his d-bag inherently sweet glory.  Prompts: I’d love anything playing with the format of the show (groundhog day loops! Janet needing Jason’s help after being rebooted each time! Jason keeps accidentally accessing pieces of information Janet has that can help them to escape!) or the strangeness of Janet’s AI falling in love with a human in the afterlife.  And I do love the rest of the cast, so feel free to include anybody else you want, if you’re keen to.  An ensemble-based fic about how everybody else keeps re-discovering and re-dealing with Jason and Janet hooking up/repeatedly marrying, would, for example, be amazing.

Hidden Legacy Series - Ilona Andrews 
Nevada Baylor

I inhaled the second and third books of this series earlier this year, and just love the world-building, relationship-building, and the everything-building of these books.  I really like Nevada, and I’d be interested in a fic dealing either either Nevada’s relationship to her family (because OMG, I loved all the reveals of everybody’s various talents) or her relationship with Rogan.  Feel free to focus on either of those requests and exclude the other - I’d love a fic about Nevada and her family (maybe vignettes focusing on the different times each person discovered their magical talents? Or future fic dealing with the fallout of the formation of House Baylor?) or just focusing in on Nevada and Rogan’s relationship (especially from earlier on, when they were reluctantly attracted to each other but skirting major issues: Magical sex pollen/fuck or die scenario?  A telepathic or soulbond spell?  A proximity spell so they can’t be more than a couple feet away from each other?)  Where ever you decide to go with this, I’m along for the ride.

Vagrant Story 
Sydney Losstarot, Ashley Riot

I’d love a story exploring the limits of Sydney’s precognition—how much did he know beforehand about the events of the game, and how much was he just guessing? Why did he pick Ashley? What does he know about the future after the events of the game? When it comes to Ashley, for the most part I’m more interested in the future than the past—what his plans are after leaving Lea Monde and the Riskbreakers, what it means that he’s now the Roodbearer, how those on the outside are going to respond to his apparent murder of the Duke. Speculation on the nature of magic in that world is welcome, as is any expansion on the glimpse of politics and religion we get in the game. If you want to include one, my preferred pairing is Ashley/Sydney, but I’m also totally open to gen.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince)

More than anything else, it’s really important to me that Laurent retains his edge—that even once he’s with Damen and happy, he still has his essential ruthlessness, his prickliness, and even that streak of cruelty that comes out when he’s hurt.

With that out of the way, a few more specific prompts:
- An outsider POV—someone in the Venetian or Akielon court, or a visitor from somewhere else, during the events of the trilogy or afterward
- The evergreen AU where Laurent and Damen met under different circumstances would be a delight
- A story about the two of them trying to integrate their kingdoms/governments—no doubt there are potential political problems galore
- If you’re feeling ambitious, I’d love to see an alternate ending to Kings Rising where, instead of getting derailed by Jokaste’s baby, they wage the full-scale war against Kastor that the first half of the book seemed to be promising.

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Elliot Schafer (In Other Lands), Luke Sunborn (In Other Lands), Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle (In Other Lands)

Some prompts, in no particular order:
- Large scale worldbuilding: the history of the Borderlands; an exploration of what else is in the Borderlands and what lies beyond them—what are they the border of? What happens when the invasion Elliot predicts actually happens?
- Elliot+Luke+Serene+Golden as a nontraditional family unit—how do they juggle the demands of their various careers, and what changes about their dynamic with Elliot and Luke’s new relationship and the addition of Golden? What assumptions do other people make about them? (Does Luke raise their collective kids?)
- An AU in which Elliot doesn’t meet Luke and Serene until they’re older—maybe Elliot never did go to school in the Borderlands, or went briefly and then left. Is he part of the invasion, or does he come to warn them? Or maybe he’s fleeing trouble in his grown-up life in our world, or Luke and Serene somehow end up here.

Decameron - Giovanni Boccaccio 

I love the Decameron stories and the way they're a window into Renaissance Italy and people's concerns and lives. Things I like about the nominated characters include: Madam Zinevra crossdresses, has adventures, and vindicates herself against injustice; Alatiel meets one irresistibly sexy pirate/warlord after another and eventually becomes Queen; and Abraham and Jehannot are merchants who are best friends despite religious differences. If another Decameron story suits your taste, I'd love a fic that draws from any of the stories - I like them all. Nominated characters, non-nominated characters, and original characters with a general inspiration from the source are all great. I love historical details, folk tales, alternative universes, and re-imaginings in different settings.

Defender's Quest (Video Game) 

I love the adventure and the characters' different stories, and the way they reveal different parts of themselves and their backgrounds as you play. I'd love to read any kind of story that you're inspired to write for this fandom. I love Azra's sarcasm and humour, her librarianism, and her epic case of chronic protagonist-itis - I'd love to read what she thinks, writes, or reads. I also love Bakal's character and his backstory, the way he's changed over the years, how he's acted as a mentor for others while bearing the weight of his own flaws, and his seriously complicated relationship with Zelemir. I love older characters and the way the weight of their experience is so interesting. I also love Ketta and her toughness and propensity for adventure, as well as the self-contradictory aspects of her character - I'd love to read more about Ketta in action. Wrenna's time imprisoned sounds like it was very traumatic. I'd love to read more about her backstory (childhood or prisoner of war), or about what Wrenna does after the game is over with her new quest to rebuild her kingdom, and her relationships with her new dragon acquaintances (I love Niru too). I love Wrenna's resilience and determination even in horrible circumstances.

Die Lustige Witwe | The Merry Widow 
Hanna Glawari (Die Lustige Witwe), Count Danilo Danilovitsch (Die Lustige Witwe), Mirko Zeta (Die Lustige Witwe), Kromow (Die Lustige Witwe)

The Merry Widow is delightful. I love the comedy combined with such an interesting, passionate relationship at the heart of it. There have been many adaptations, interpretations, and settings - I'd love to read any version of the story, with one or more of these characters. I love the way Hanna and Danilo are so well matched, with Hanna's intelligence, pride, and kindness fighting against Danilo's own share of those qualities, and the way that Hanna's resilience and wit win through in the end. I'd love to read about Hanna having an adventure, solving a mystery or resolving a problem, whether on her own or teamed with Danilo. Or Kromow/Zeta slash would be fun. I like the joke in some adaptations: "I love you!"/"Now, General, call me old fashioned, but I still prefer 'don't ask, don't tell'!" What if Zeta and Kromow found love with each other? I also like Valencienne's character very much.

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price

I love Fanny Price. A shy bookworm, told all her life that she's the "lowest and last" and must be grateful above all things to the wealthy family that took her in, and who turns out to have a spine of pure titanium when it's important. I love how Fanny's kind, contemplative, thoughtful, and stays true to herself and her integrity even when all the circumstances and the people she loves are against her. Some optional prompts: I'd love to read how Fanny continues to grow and develop past the novel, taking up new responsibilities at Mansfield Parsonage, learning to love it, and her new adventures. Fanny in a fantasy or science-fiction tale, or ghost story, would also be lovely. Fanny and her sibling relationships with William and Susan are warm and kind - watching them interact is great. Or alternative universe roleswap: Fanny Crawford is a shy bookworm spoiled and indulged by her father the Admiral, while Mary Price is a poor, vivacious foundling taken in by the wealthy Bertrams and her dreadful Aunt Norris - what happens?

Baldur's Gate 
Jon Irenicus, Bodhi (Baldur's Gate), Xzar, Aphril

I'd love to read darkfic involving one or more of these characters. Irenicus and Bodhi are such interesting, threatening villains. I like Irenicus' cold ambition and intelligence, and Bodhi's enthusiasm for bloodthirst, mayhem, and taking over the Athkatla underworld with little idea of what she's going to *do* with it. I'd like to read your take on Xzar and his madness. Or I'd like to read your take on Aphril - I know she's a very minor character but she has very interesting abilties! A story set in Spellhold or Athkatla would be great, or an exploration of characters' backstory or futurefic. These four characters have a lot of options for dysfunctional, chilling, or ghostly stories. As an alternative, I love this fandom in general and I love being surprised - I'd enjoy reading an adventure with your favourite combination of characters, nominated or not.

Robin of Sherwood 
Guy of Gisburne (Robin of Sherwood), Marion of Leaford (Robin of Sherwood)

WANT: I would love a HET story in the Robert of Huntingdon era of the series, so with “blond Robin” :-), preferrably M or E rated. Guy of Gisburne and Marion of Leaford are my two favourite characters, but in the series they hardly interact, and if they do it is with mutual contempt and loathing. Hence, I love to ship them :-) If you could write me a story that centers around the two of them, I’d be very happy. You can use any of the other characters you like, but please keep the focus on them.

I prefer sexually laden stories. You can make it smutty romance, keep it more subtle with sexual tension (resolved or otherwise), or go the other way and choose something more explicit and rough. M but also E rated is fine by me. Don’t feel compelled to write a romance between them if you just can’t wrap your head around that! Dubcon, noncon or anything like that is fine as well. I honestly have no sexual squicks or triggers (when it comes to fanfic, anyway :-) ). I love romance, but angsty and dark stories just as much. It all depends on what you feel comfortable writing.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, or crossovers, please. I didn’t like the Knights of the Apocalypse audioplay, so I would prefer it if you ignore its existence in the fic storyline. The only exception: If you could write me a fic that redeems Guy after the things he does to Marion in the audioplay (something I can’t do anymore, which is the main reason I dislike the play), AND still keep him in character, I would be grateful to you until my dying day!!!

Atonement (2007) 
Briony Tallis, Cecilia Tallis, Robbie Turner (Atonement)

WANT: I’d love a HET story about Robbie and Cecilia, preferrably something romantic and sweet. Maybe some hurt/comfort or emotional hurt/comfort? In this case, you don't have to include Briony.

Alternatively, you could write about Briony Tallis too, in combination with either Cecilia or Robbie or the both of them. Then I would not like it to be sweet, but more angsty and jarring, seeing as to what she did to them.

I like sex in my stories, be it implicit or explicit, depending on how it fits with the storyline. Anything from T to E rated is fine by me. I have no sexual squicks or triggers.

DO NOT WANT: No slash or crossovers, please. No stories that easily redeem Briony either (except if you precede it with some heavy duty angst and suffering first ;-) )

You Rang M'Lord? 
James Twelvetrees, Poppy Meldrum

WANT: I’d love a HET story that centers around these two, during the time when the Meldrums were rich and thriving. I like the dynamic between them in the series. James’ bashfulness and rigid propriety, Poppy’s perky, teasing, spoilt bitchiness. Please keep them in character but develop things between them a bit more. All this tension needs to be resolved! ;-) An unforgivable slip up from James, maybe? You can use any of the other characters too, as long as you keep the focus on James and Poppy. A look into the triangle with Ivy is also a possibility, for example. For this series I would like things not to be too explicit, though. An M rating, maximum.

DO NOT WANT: No slash, fluff, crossovers or AU’s please.

Las Chicas del Cable | Cable Girls 
Alba Romero | Lidia Aguilar Dávila, Carlos Cifuentes, Francisco Gomez

So many loyalty, identity, and daddy issues in this canon! In terms of shipping, I’d love Alba/Carlos, Alba/Francisco, Franciso/Carlos, or Alba/Carlos/Francisco, but would also be happy to see anything that takes place when none of them are involved with the any others. It's also completely fine if you're inspired to focus more on two of the characters rather than all three.

 Prompts that can be shippy or more gen:

·       Alba, Carlos, and Francisco attempt to figure out what to do during the upcoming coup attempt. Does one of them get injured? Are Carlos and Francisco adept at helping Alba plan in different ways? Do they have to take on other assumed identities at any point in the plan?

·       Anything surrounding the death of Carlos’s father/Francisco’s father-in-law. Does Alba help one or both of them process it? Does Carlos ever discover what Alba was trying to do about the will/why she was trying to do it? Does Carlos turn to Francisco or Alba for guidance/comfort in any way?

·       Is either Carlos or Alba able to find a way to get Francisco off on the suspicion of murder charge? Do they have to work with Victoria? Does she share any stories of Alba’s past that make Carlos understand a bit better?

·       Francisco or Carlos (or both) must work with Angeles, Marga, etc. to prevent a catastrophe (saving Alba?)

Ship prompts:

·       Two or three of them have an epic fight-and-fuck situation occur

·      Drowsy intimacy between two or three of them after a problem has been solved, or they’re done working for the day

·      They find themselves in a fuck-or-die situation, either in terms of blackmail or something happening during the coup

·      Alba’s saved everyone she can save (or has to promise to leave in order to save them) and Carlos and/or Francisco seek to find her, potentially getting together themselves on the way to her

Un Village Français | A French Village 
Anselme (Un village français), Antoine (Un village français)

I absolutely adore mentor/protege-ish relationships, and this is one of my favorites, especially given that Antoine and Anselme are both leaders of their respective movements, but, as everyone keeps saying, Antoine is 21 and so young while Anselme has more experience, but doesn't quite have the idealism or the restraint that the Resistance sometimes needs (though Antoine isn't always the most restrained...)

There are so many moments that I love between these two, from Anselme taking Antoine's face in his hands and stroking his hair (even giving it a little tug) when they're hiding from the Nazis and Antoine wants to go back and rescue his friends while Anselme gently tells him that he can't, and that the resistance needs his leadership, to Anselme shoving him away from someone's body and telling him he needs to "learn when to shut up" when Antoine questions him about why he blames him for the death. And then....oh man, Anselme telling Antoine to obey or get out and also telling him there will be "no discussion" of Antoine scouting a town to make sure the Nazis have left because of the risk of losing him vs. Anselme standing up for Antoine when Edmond says he's too young to be a judge. And I haven't even gotten to the part where Antoine puts himself between pitchfork-wielding Anselme and Alban with his knife....

Okay, so I love all these moments between them, how Anselme calls Antoine "kid" all the time and protects him and gives him orders, but also respects him, and how Antoine sometimes looks for that guidance and sometimes shrugs it off, especially when he differs very strongly from Anselme in terms of how he thinks a mission or post-liberation justice should look.

I definitely ship these two, but would also welcome Gen--anything about their relationship would be lovely.

Prompts that could be gen or shippy:

&nbsp;

·      Missing scene after Anselme and Suzanne storm the police station looking for Marchetti. Antoine quit off screen after that and Anselme seemed to know. I'd love to see that conversation, and also see what Anselme thinks about Antoine joining the military.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine disobeying Anselme and getting himself injured

&nbsp;

·      Post-war, Antoine putting on Claude's play and Antoine watching it

&nbsp;

·      Canon divergence where Antoine somehow ends up being taken prisoner in the school

&nbsp;

·      One taking a bullet for the other

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

&nbsp;

·      I love how Antoine's virginity kept being mentioned. Would love to see Anselme taking it.

&nbsp;

·      Antoine and Anselme doing the kissing scene in Claude's play, and what happens after.

&nbsp;

·      The effect of their policy/mission clashes on their love life. Is one better able to compartmentalize than the other?

&nbsp;

·      Post-war reunion fic, where they try to figure out if what they had was a wartime fling or something that could be more permanent

&nbsp;

Please see letter for more general likes and sexual things I like in fic.

Please do not include: AUs (though canon divergences are fine!), crossovers, under-18 sex, character death (except as prompted in The Lion in Winter)

The Secret Country Series - Pamela Dean 
Fence (Secret Country), Randolph (Secret Country)

This series and its questions about identity and its emphasis on honor and loyalty and sacrifice just does things to me. I’m curious about whether Fence and Randolph ever felt their own ideas of themselves shifting in any way depending on what Melanie did or the children said. I’d also love to know more about Randolph’s training under Fence (does it resume post-canon?) as well as more about either’s point of view about the events in canon, or what happens after. Does Ted have to continue fencing lessons with Randolph? Are there any additional threats they have to contend with? Can they find a way to communicate with Patrick and Ellen (in the event they feel they need help?) even though they can’t go back and forth?

I ship Randolph/Fence, but am also happy with gen or either (or both!) characters with Ted or Ruth once they’re over 18. It's also fine if you're inspired to focus more on one character than the other.

Some more specific prompts that could be shippy or gen:

·      Fence and Randolph revisit the realm of the dead (and the ghost of King William may or may not play matchmaker, either intentionally or unintentionally).

·      Songs and stories that were once uncomfortable are comfortable again

·      One or both of them still feel haunted by the dead king and the dead children

·      Fence and Randolph reconnect while helping Ted reorganize the council

·      They somehow have a need to communicate with Ellen and Patrick and try to devise a way to do so

·      Ruth, Ted, or Laura tell them tell them tales from their world that resonate with Fence and Randolph

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help being intimate even during the period where Fence knows Randolph has killed the king

·      Fence and Randolph find a way to send intimate feelings/thoughts to one another even when they’re separated

·      All the h/c here. Maybe Randolph is a bit wounded after the duel with Ted? Maybe Fence’s magical strength is exhausted and he needs to be taken care of?

·      Fence and Randolph can’t help flirting in front of Ted while they’re trying to teach him. Maybe he wants to join in once he realizes what they’re doing and they let him once he’s of age? All the power/identity issues there would be amazing as well.

·      Does the Hidden Land have sex magic? Do Fence and Randolph use it to bind one another (and/or Ted or Ruth?)

Devil's Cub - Georgette Heyer 
Dominic Alastair (Devil's Cub), Justin Alastair (Devil's Cub), Léonie Alastair (Devil's Cub)

I am all about the Alastair family dynamics here. I love how cool and above it all Justin is (or attempts to be) with Leonie at first, and then with Dominic (the moment in Devil’s Cub when he learns from Mary that Dominic doesn’t consider him terrible comes to mind). I love that these family dynamics are caring (though that caring is sometimes disguised) as well as competitive (Leonie v. Justin fencing, Justin v. Dominic carriage speed) and would love to see how that started/changed over the years.

A few more specific prompts:

·      Justin, Dominic, and Leonie (or one/a combination) are set upon by highywaymen. Or either Leonie or Dominic pretend to be highywaymen (and if so, were they competitive with one another about it)?

·      In These Old Shades, Justin admits that he wouldn’t have taken Leonie to some of the places he did earlier in the novel—where might he feel he’s made similar mistakes with Dominic?

·      What did Leonie and Justin agree and disagree about with respect to raising Dominic? Which parent was more likely to intercede with the other in Dominic’s favor? What were some occasions where that situation was flipped?

·      H/C! I need injured Dominic in my life. A canon divergence where he is hit in the duel at the beginning would be fantastic—or it could have been an earlier duel, or something that happened when he was a child (either Leonie or Justin being rougher in fencing or what have you than they meant to be?)

·      Did Dominic ever have to cover for either Leonie or Justin in any of their adventures at any point?

The White Queen (TV) 
Elizabeth of York Queen of England (The White Queen), Richard III of England (The White Queen)

I ship these two and am so happy that their relationship is canon in The White Queen, but would also be very excited to read gen about them. The weight of family history between them and the different way they feel about it, is endlessly fascinating to me.

Some gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth spends a period of time living with Richard and Anne as a child. Maybe she’s traumatized by George’s death?

·      Richard and Elizabeth reminisce about Edward after his death, remembering both the king and the father (and father figure).

·      Canon divergence where Elizabeth sneaks away and accompanies Richard and Edward on their flight out of England when they’re betrayed

Ship prompts:

·      Anything that explores their different feelings about the incestuous nature of their relationship. Does Elizabeth ever address him as "Uncle" after they've slept together?

·      Anything about their power dynamics (Richard's "I'm not Richard. I'm your king" still gives me chills).

·      Post-battle sex, or post-battle diplomacy

·      Elizabeth wants to learn more about how to fight. Richard teaches her.

·      Very welcome kinks/tropes: Thank God We're Alive Sex, Spanking (Richard spanking Elizabeth either as play or as play punishment), Handholding, First Time Sex, Loyalty, Kneeling, Throne Sex, anything ceremonial, H/C 

Please see letter for more general likes and sexual things I like in fic.

The Lion in Winter (1968) 
Geoffrey Plantagenet (The Lion in Winter), Richard "The Lionheart" of England (Lion in Winter)

I can never get enough stories about this canon! The shifting allegiances, power plays and masked, feigned, or exposed vulnerability get me every time.

I do happen to ship Richard/Geoffrey (and Geoffrey/Philip, and Richard/Geoffrey/Philip), but I completely understand if you don’t!

Gen prompts:

·      Canon divergence where Richard is king and Geoffrey is still alive. Is he Richard’s chancellor? Or is he in France with Philip?

·      Richard and Geoffrey on opposite sides of the battlefield (or the same side). What does “coming to terms” look like to them? What orders do they give their men about harm coming to their brothers?

·      Canon divergence where Geoffrey becomes king. I imagine this would only happen after Richard’s death. Ghost!Richard observing Geoffrey’s reign would be something. Or, what is Richard up to while Geoffrey’s king?

·      Anything about their early lives, either political training or military training, or other memorable family holidays

·      H/C! Injured or sick Richard or Geoffrey. Do they still bait one another? Does Geoffrey allow Richard to see him as genuinely vulnerable? Does Richard expose his own vulnerability to Geoffrey, intentionally or unintentionally?

·      Richard protecting Geoffrey (from their mother or father or John or Philip? From Richard himself?)

&nbsp;

Ship prompts:

·      H/C with huddling for warmth that leads to more

·      Someone observes the two of them (from behind a tapestry or not), and with one or both of their knowledge (or not).

·      Richard is surprised to discover that Geoffrey’s a virgin. Does Geoffrey taunt him into doing something about it? Or does Richard make a suggestion Geoffrey won’t refuse?

-Richard domming the hell out of Geoffrey. Is this a case where Geoffrey resists this dynamic vehemently outside the bedroom but enjoys it and accepts it inside the bedroom, or does Geoffrey resist but secretly enjoy it in the bedroom as well?

Please do not include: AUs (though canon divergences are fine!), crossovers, under-18 sex, character death (except as prompted in The Lion in Winter)

I really love how easy it is for Ryouma to fluster Chizuru because he's a little more forward thanks to his familiarity with Western culture. I like seeing Chizuru deal with learning she's a demon and I think that would be especially interesting in this case because judging from Kyoto Winds we won't be seeing loads more of the shinsengumi? Shiranui seems to be tagging along with them so maybe she ends up asking him questions? 

Also would be up for an SSL-esque Highschool AU, as Ryouma's not in SSL what role would he have? A fellow student, teacher? A student at a rival boys school who tries to get Chizuru to go to their school?

I would honestly just be really happy to read more about Ryouma and Chizuru together and there's not much for them! Though please no major spoilers for the second half of his route and I'd ask that you don't make Kazama the bad guy as he's one of my faves.

Could just be them being domestic, attempting to cook together, cleaning together and getting distracted~ If she does have the poison, I'd love to see what creative things they come up with so they can kiss and touch a little more.

Or I'd like to see more of her personal life does she have another job besides hacking and collecting information? Is hacking something she always wanted to do or she just turned out to be good at it so why not make some money off it. Is that how she met Akira and why he choose to work with her later.

Political Animals 
Thomas "T. J." Hammond

TJ, to me, reads more as someone who has depression than an addict (mainly because I have depression and he's like me in that sense) – to me, the alcohol and drugs seem more like a coping mechanism than an addiction, though I don't think he or his family see it that way.

I love TJ, and I think he just desperately needs a friend he can be honest with and get support from! I'd love to see that happening after the end of the show - does he stay up at the farm? Take off to see the world? Get involved in some kind of volunteering, like building a house? Start a free food truck? TJ goes back to college? Getting to know Anne when she and Douglas first meet? Future fic after the election? Or even after Douglas (presumably) becomes president? TJ being the fun queer uncle after Douglas and Anne have kids? Or TJ adopting a child and being an anxious father?

Really, anything where TJ gets to be happy and healthy, and I'll love you! I'd prefer you not crossover with any other Sebastian Stan fandoms, please. I'd also prefer you not go non-show AU (space pirates, fairy tales etc). For other characters, I like Anne best, and Agent Clarke. I'm really not a fan of Bud Hammond.

General likes: hurt/comfort, mild angst, positive endings, friendship stories, verbal humour, mild teasing, future fic, stuff set before the show/book/movie started, slash/femslash, developing relationships, gen/friendship, caring and affection, queer communities, kid fic, kittens and puppies, bookshops.

With the baby if you wanted to go that way - maybe Beth and Chris have an open relationship? What if they were together when Mars happened - angsty long-distance space romance? Or cute coded letters? Reunion sex at NASA?

Alternatively, I'd love to read a friendship piece between the two of them - bonding when Mindy's new to NASA? Doing a press tour after Mars? Geeking out together over the space trip? Worried friend emails between NASA and the ship?

Really, I'd love anything that involved the two of them, in canon universe or not - I feel like they'd make awesome space pirates, for example. 

I really love everyone in The Martian, so feel free to bring in anyone else you want to.

I love canon, so if you don't stay in the world, then I'd like something that has the same slightly out there vibe, rather than a "mundane" AU. I'd prefer you not crossover with other Jeremy Renner fandoms please, and I prefer Will written to be gay if you're going to write something where that comes up - if you want to ship him with any of the men in canon, please do, or create an OC boyfriend.

Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

general likes: Fic of any length, tense, POV, style that feels motivated. Character, insight, mood, setting. Dreams, nightmares, the subconscious, things said and unsaid. Some angst, characters struggling, H&amp;C. Weather: cold, rain, snow, wind.   

prompts: Slash, friends to lovers, secret and developing relationships. Pre-slash, something almost, not quite, maybe. Gen, comrades-in-arms, friendship. Post-canon: Did Collins see much more of the war as a pilot? How did or does Farrier get home? How, when, where do they meet again? (Preferably in the 1940s, though!) Collins and the Dawsons – acquaintances, connection, conversations, friends, help, support… not romance. Anything about flying: clouds, heights, the sky, weather conditions; adrenaline, danger, freedom, time running out, trapped, water… Almost drowning.

I’m fine with reading about phobias, PTSD and traumas, just not to the extent that they’d prevent these characters from ever leading independent lives. For post-canon: feel free to assume both characters survived the war and were reunited. I’m also fine with original characters appearing when appropriate, but please not in romantic relationships with the requested characters. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. Unrequested romantic/sexual relationships. AU (setting, sex/gender, age…), reincarnation, crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury (detailed descriptions of burns or loss of limb…) or fatal illness, character death. OTT fluff or excessive use of pet names (used once or twice can be really effective, though!). Unlikely general attitudes for the 1940s. Tragic or unhappy endings.

Missing scenes: I don’t ship Alex and Martin, but I’m fond of Martin, and Alex was clearly unsettled by the revelation. Post-canon: could be interesting if some of Alex, Tischbier &amp; Martin met again, months or years after the series (but preferably in the 1980s!). How Martin did and didn’t pick up on how the first two knew each other. Alex finding about Tischbier’s role.

I’m fine with the threat of HIV/AIDS affecting the characters, but don’t want to read about Alex dying slowly. Ambiguous or open endings are fine. I’m also fine reading about attempted suicide, depressive or suicidal thoughts. For post-canon, feel free to assume the shot at the end was General Edel, whether or not it was fatal – or even intended to be. Any rating is fine, or certainly up to M. 

DNW: PWP or kink. AU (setting, sex/gender, age, orientation…), crossovers, RPF. Serious permanent injury or fatal illness, non-canonical character death.

I love the humor - and the danger of the Rivers of London universe. Some of my prompts are about Peter/Nightingale's (real or biological) age and generational differences. Other prompts are the sexy shippy tropes of my heart:

• Aging at a different rate and in opposite directions: what if they meet in the middle? What if the age difference is the reverse of what it is now?
• Some insight into what Nightingale thinks of Peter's brand of magic and of his modern ways.
• Peter discovers a book of sex magic and practices it - on Nightingale.
• How would a bodyswap affect their magic? Exploring their swapped bodies, together or on their own ;)
• They pretend to be married while visiting a picturesque Stepford village on a case. Cue fakeout makeouts!
• They didn't know they were dating, to a ridiculous degree.
• A bottle-episode story involving Peter's new Ferrari GTO. That Nightingale more or less gave him.
• The Folly snowed in during a winter holiday, its crew being festive or macabre; extra love for the Folly worldbuilding
• Casefic: a scary modern urban legend or Lovecraftian/cosmic horror

Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 
Dickie Greenleaf, Peter Smith-Kingsley, Tom Ripley

In the Ripley universe, I enjoy the morally fluid characters + identity porn with its mental acrobatics + the dangerous closeted passions in the beautiful European settings. 

• All of three of them end up at Cortina, snowed in for days. Hoping for murder and relationship drama.

Fa yeung nin wa | In the Mood for Love (2000) 
Chow Mo-wan, Su Li Zhen

As this is a movie about the missed connections and a twisted kind of fantasy, I would love to get a story about either of these things:

• Maybe Su and Chow don't miss their connection and get together?
• A more in-depth story about how Su and Chow roleplay their cheating spouses. Extra love for a touch of the movie-like atmosphere.
• Su and Chow act out fictional scenarios as other random or movie couples as a turn-on.

Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song) 
Singer (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song)), My Lord (Did You Like The Battle Sir? - Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar (Song))

I saw Greg and CIaran at Shrewsbury Folk Festival this year and was blown away, and by the album (The Silent Majority). This is outright one of the slashiest songs I’ve ever heard. I’ve not been able to work out if that was deliberate - Bev Pegg, who wrote the lyrics, doesn’t seem like the sort of person who’d write that… but there it is. It’s full of hurt/comfort, but also a political undertone. 
I’d enjoy anything that adds a landscape around the events of the song - a backstory to the singer character, to the lord, to anything that’s going on. Or you could AU this to a different time and place entirely - perhaps they’re gangsters in the 1920s? 
Or you could go very detailed into what happens immediately after the song, while the lord rests, slowly dying, on the singer’s bed.

Archer's Goon - Diana Wynne Jones 

Diana Wynne Jones was and is one of my favourite authors, and has been since I was about 7 and read “The Ogre Downstairs”. There’s something about Archer’s Goon that I particularly love, though - not least the young boy with the fascination with spaceships which I *cough* might have identified with. And Shine, and Torquil… and Dillian. Feel free to write about any of the characters in the book, as well as (or even instead of) the ones nominated.
I got a really good story set after the book a couple of years ago, but I’m always up for another take on it. 
Exactly how is Howard going to “ensure Awful grows up right”? What does that even mean? Is he going to muck it up like he did with the first spaceship and the time thing? What can he actually do as his powers develop? Will he stay on the straight and narrow, or start cheating? 
How does Erskine fare after escaping the sewers? Of the good guys, he’s the one with the sharpest edge, I think. And does Torquil end up in his natural home, Las Vegas? 
Is there a chance that Awful grows up like Shine, as hinted in the scene where Awful visits Venturus’ temple? That might be a very interesting thing.
If you felt like answering any of these questions, that would be great, or you can go in completely different directions and that would be fabulous too.

'Allo 'Allo! 

I was, I confess, a little chary about including this fandom, given recent events. I love ‘Allo ‘Allo - I love the parody of (the excellent) Secret Army, the silliness, the way that pretty much everyone in it is an idiot. I could live without some of the treatment of Edith. 
Otto Flick and Helga… The canonically kinky relationship. I like that Flick thinks he’s amazingly competent (nobody in this show is amazingly competent). I like Helga’s constant shouting. I would love anything with these two in - perhaps with them questioning Michelle Dubois (also nominated)... and if you wanted to do something kinky, that would be brilliant, but it would be great if it was also foolish in some way (perhaps they are questioning her about completely the wrong thing?).
Michelle Dubois - I love the way she can speak English (done with accents), I love the mixture of competence (as mentioned above, it’s only… limited) and yet an inability not to get involved in stupid plans, and I love the catchphrase.
Von Smallhausen is a bit of a one joke character… which makes him ideal for fanfic in my opinion. It would be lovely to see something from his perspective - what does he actually think of Flick? What is going on in his (low to the ground) head?

I’ve been a Richard Thompson fan since I first got played a cassette of Rumour and Sigh, and this is one of his great story songs. There’s a lot of characterisation of James in particular, and a little bit for Molly. There’s also a bit of sexiness here, not least in the motorbike itself. I’d love any kind of story that explored what happens after the song - how does Molly get on with the bike? Or maybe something that expands on the bare bones in the song - how does James Adie get a shotgun blast to the chest while committing armed robbery? 
There’s some space for kink here, too - “red hair and black leather”.

I love that their flirting always seems to be based on a mutual understanding of where boundaries are. I’d enjoy anything that felt like one of the series’ plots, or anything that got a little beneath that swaggering facade for either Steed or Peel.
There is so much possibility for kink here. Putting aside “A Touch Of Brimstone” (which is hot, but a little obvious, perhaps), the series seemed to love tying Emma Peel up - and only sometimes was she rescued by Steed. It almost felt like it was part of the plan. I’d enjoy anything that played with that, in any way you chose.

Blood Drive (TV) 
Arthur Bailey, Grace d'Argento

Arthur/Grace, with some real time to spare, like, at least a night without interruptions. As porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. If you wanted to incorporate some dom!Grace or Grace allowing Arthur to be tender with her and maybe even admitting to a feeling or two, I wouldn't object to it.

And/or if you had some typically Blood Drive-esque plot insanity or perversion (medical kink, anyone?) or serial killer AU or dark!Arthur you're dying to do . . . If there's another fandom's universe you'd love to subject them to (or v.v.) . . . go wild.

Whatever you decide, just please make sure they have each other's backs and there's a sense of twisted fun however dark it gets.


Request 2 by Bottomfeeder
Wolf Creek (TV) 
Eve Thorogood, Sullivan Hill

Eve/Sullivan, as porny -- or not -- as you're comfortable with. Basically, I think their time together was cut way too short and I would love a fix-it or at least an extension of their time together. An AU that branches off from canon or a totally re-imagined contemporary AU where they meet under different circumstances could be interesting, maybe where they have to work together on a case and kick a lot of ass together? There were some mythical elements to Eve's journey that I found interesting.

If you gave them something closer to a Happily Ever After than they got, I would give you huge bonus points. Especially if you didn't shy away from the dubious level of appropriateness of their relationship, but instead embraced it. Honestly, aside from their obvious love for each other, that's a big part of their appeal for me.

Mostly though, however simple or complicated you decide to make your fic, I want all the feels. Full-on emotion-porn is my absolute favorite thing.

The Faculty (1998) 
Casey Connor, Zeke Tyler

Casey/Zeke, as romantic/porny - or not - as you're comfortable with taking that relationship.

Directly post-movie is cool and so is any AU you wanna do, such as no-aliens or Hellraiser or Blade Runner or whatever you want. It doesn't have to be a super-complicated plot (but that's cool, too!), I just want Casey and Zeke vs. the World -- whether literally or figuratively -- with them being really intense about each other and being each others' ride-or-die bitches. I'm fascinated about how they're kinda Opposites Attract but not really 'cause they're kinda two sides of the same coin. 

If you can work in some more in-depth exploration of Casey's affinity for photography, I would give you some bonus points, for sure.

I don't mind angst as long as there's light at the end of the tunnel.

Washington Capitals RPF 
T. J. Oshie (Washington Capitals RPF), Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals RPF)

T.J./Nicky would be amazing, 'cause there's barely any fic out there for that pairing, but if that's not your thing I understand. If you wanna throw Ovi in to complicate things, that's cool, too. I just wanna read something where Oshie and Backie together are the focus 'cause it's so rare to get a Backstrom fic where the focus isn't just him and Ovi.

Bonus points for porn, but not required obviously. I'd love some emotion-porn, too, whether that's platonic or otherwise. If you're going the non-platonic route, I don't mind infidelity or a not married/divorced AU. However you decide to handle the wives not being the focus is fine. Nothing against them, they're just not my obsession the way Nicklas and T.J. are.

If you wanna do some crazy Mafia or Harry Potter AU or keep it totally canon, I'm down with whatever inspires you. I don't mind angst as long as things de-angst themselves in the end. Actually, I love angst that turns into happiness. 

As long as they feel like T.J. and Nicky, I'm pretty open. Just please god no depressing endings. It's soul-crushing enough being a Caps fan most of the time.

SUPER EXTRA BONUS POINTS FOR SIDNEY "FINGER-CHOPPER" CROSBY GETTING HIS COMEUPPANCE IN SOME WAY. OR T.J. AND BACKIE EXPRESSING THEIR (MY) UTTER CONTEMPT. If you do not share my loathing, then probably best to just mention him as little as possible.

Daredevil (Comics) 
Matt Murdock (Daredevil Comics), Elektra Natchios (Daredevil comics)

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I like explorations of Matt’s senses and limitations in pretty much any context. The comics don't do a good job of giving him limitations (and the show is even worse tbh).

I like Matt being a control freak but still not having control.

I like Matt needing help, even if he’s shitty at asking for it. I like missing scenes. I like tough situations. I don’t have any really good prompts, I apologise.

For something from Elektra's focal point, I am interested in WHY Matt. Why are they drawn to him, why do they fight with/for him, why do they care about him. Elektra moves in and out of Matt's life. Why doesn't she just steer clear of him; it's not like she doesn't know he's a disaster? 

There’s some nonsense about Matt in my letter post, feel free to hop over there. AS A NOTE, I really am not a huge fan of how Mark Waid writes Matt. I like angsty Daredevil way more than weird, shave-my-head-wear-a-terrible-suit and have a manic episode Daredevil. I'm not saying DON'T WRITE WAID-ERA so much as I'm saying, keep some of his darkness if you can! I like his darkness. I'm not up to date on the new run of DD so avoiding that is probably best just so I understand the context. My fave era of DD is around the time he ends up in Ryker's when he's being all I'M THE KINGPIN. Though honestly, putting a story in any vague era is totally fine, canon compliance is definitely not required.

I would prefer not to have fic with Kirsten or Karen as a focal point. I also REALLY LOVE Matt's friendship with Foggy and if you want to talk about how much that matters to him, I am here for this! I think platonic relationships don't get anywhere near enough attention or importance in fandom. I don't ship Matt with Foggy at all but I love their friendship. Obviously I didn't pick Foggy here so if he's nowhere to be found that's totally fine as well - I just want you as an author to have more details rather than less? I don't know.&nbsp;

For these characters as a ship: I think this relationship is endlessly complicated because they have very very different moral compasses. Although I don’t think Matt’s is really perfect (especially if we actually count Shadowland as canon), it’s not anywhere near as off base as Elektra’s. And they’ve been enemies, but they’re not always. Elektra saved his life, after all! Like with Danny or Frank, I’d love to see WHY she’s so drawn to him, in spite of herself. What she thinks of the man that he grew up to be, and how they relate now. Also femdom here is totally appreciated if you’re into the sexy fic!

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

I am obsessed with this world building. My big gripe about this book is there just was not enough of it, not enough backstory. The book is ALL ACTION PACKED and I absolutely adored every second but I want more. I'd actually love to have more set in Neverland, before Hook freaks out and decides he needs to go home, or something that juxtaposes their time in Neverland with their time in the real world. I'm also really into the idea of Hook teaching Peter about love and relationships and whatever.

They could have an adventure together (in either world).

Neither of them seems to be wired for quiet domestic life, not really, so how do they adjust to the idea of that? How do they spice it up?

Discovering the world and each other together, or going back to Neverland, or finding another fantasy, or more backstory, or taking what is already there and building a slower burn between them, I'm down for all of it.

I'm also obviously down for dirty dirty porn so if that's your thing, write that. 

I'm definitely fine with Ernest being included in any capacity; I didn't specifically request him bc I don't want a fic about just him but if you throw him in, that's fine!

I'm also interested in Star and David backstory.

Apologies that this isn't a great prompt but I'll add more to my letter if I can think of anything.

Terminator Genisys 
Sarah Connor (Terminator Genisys), Pops (Terminator Genisys)

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

PROMPTS: The future being undone, the future NOT being undone, growing up a soldier, the differences/similarities in Sarah's upbringing and Kyle's, saving humanity, learning to trust a robot

I would LOVE to see something in the veins of the older films where the T-800 isn't just comic relief. Or combining ideas from the Sarah Connor Chronicles, with the machine ACTUALLY learning to be human instead of just being like super awkward for 40 years or something??? I would really like to see that.

I'm especially interested in Pops learning *from Sarah* how to be human. And I want Sarah to be MORE than just some incubator for the human savior. She's more than that and the older movies especially throw that away. The new movie throws it away less (which is part of what I liked about it), but I think it could go further.

ALSO I didn't like the gimmick of robot aging, so if you scrap that, I'm fine with it. (Actually, it could make a REALLY interesting time: how do they handle Pops not actually aging throughout all these years? I'm fine with his machinery wearing out some bc they don't have proper upkeep techniques but I don't see why the T-800 would be made so it AGED.)

Only thing I really do not want is NO PREGNANCY TALK AT ALL, no character death.

If you're including Kyle, that's fine and welcome, but I am not terribly interested in a romance with Sarah and Kyle. I don't think they're there yet. Exploring them learning to get along and maybe finding things that they enjoy about each other, a more organic thing than just "we have sex and you die 48 hours later and I spend one movie and a TV series crying about what a great guy you were" is great!

Mr. Robot (TV) 
Elliot Alderson, Tyrell Wellick, Edward Alderson | Mr. Robot

General DNWs: Pregnancy, kidfic, fluff without depth, character death unless specifically mentioned otherwise, AUs unless specifically mentioned otherwise, crack, second-person POVs

Please see my letter for naughty/fandom-specific DNWs.

There is so much to explore in Mr. Robot that I'm not even sure where to start with it.

Even though Elliot and Mr. Robot share the same body, we see in s1 especially that they interact as if they don't. Mr. Robot looks like and is based on Elliot's dad, but from what we've seen of his actual dad, they're not actually the same. Before Elliot realises any of this, their relationship could be pretty much anything. Mr. Robot is bonkers and is willing to put Elliot in severe danger, but he's also willing to try to save him from it. Anything you want to do with that is fine.

For Tyrell, does he realise the difference between Mr. Robot and Elliot? He's pretty perceptive, and obviously he was working with Mr. Robot without Elliot's knowledge, for some time. What if he DOES know the difference between them, or figures out that two people live in Elliot's body? How does he purposefully interact with them differently? Does he play them off each other? Also, at the end of s2, he tells Angela he loves Elliot. Where did that come from? Fill in missing scenes, make something up, I don't know.

I love Angela so if you want to include her, please do. I don't really care for Darlene so I'd prefer she not have a central role to play if she shows up. 

AS A NOTE, I realise that the third season will have started by the time yuletide opens but I would like to request that you NOT write anything relating to the third season because I don't know how easily accessible it will be to me so while I'd like to keep up on it, I may not be able to and I really hate spoilers! Sorry about that.

National Football League RPF 
Aaron Rodgers (National Football League RPF)

I would really like a fic in which Aaron falls in love with a guy (or is in an established relationship with one). Anybody on his team would be great! I like coming-out fics if you'd like to write about how Aaron and his boyfriend become the first out active NFL players, but that's not a must. Hurt/comfort after an injury or defeat would be great, or celebration fic after a victory/record-breaking game. I love basically all the romance tropes, and I also really like the game of football, so if you do too you can definitely use all the detail you like.

If you can't see Aaron with any of his current teammates, future fic in which he's an analyst and falls in love with a fellow analyst would be cool too! Alex Smith, maybe? Colin Kaepernick? Odell Beckham Jr.? 

My DNWs are Aaron in a het relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and bodily fluids kinks.

Washington Capitals RPF 
Alexander Ovechkin (Washington Capitals RPF)

For this fandom my ship is Ovi/hockey. No other ships, please (though Ovi teasingly flirting with everyone is okay, and pretty much canon anyways). 

So Ovi just started the season by scoring 3 goals in the first game and 4 goals in the second. Obviously this is not sustainable - or is it? Crack fic in which Ovi just keeps scoring hat tricks, game after game, and the team half thinks he made a deal with the devil, would be great. Does he start racking up superstitions and/or gameday rituals? 

OR I would very, very much like fic in which the Caps win the Cup, with Ovi scoring the winning goal in uber-dramatic fashion. :D

Or just Ovi kicking butt and taking names and playing epic pranks on the rest of the locker room between the kicking butt and taking names.

My DNWs are Ovi in a relationship, paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death, and the Chicago Blackhawks.

Tennis RPF 
Roger Federer (Tennis RPF), Severin Luthi (Tennis RPF), Stanislas Wawrinka (Tennis RPF)

Roger's the most successful tennis player of all time, and it's due in large part to Seve. What people don't know is that Seve isn't just Roger's coach, he's his dom too. Behind closed doors, Roger lets off stress by happily surrendering control to Seve and giving him everything he asks for. When Stan starts trying to improve his game, he comes to Roger and asks for advice. Roger points him towards Seve...

Any and all kinks are more than welcome here. Roger as an eager sub is my happy place, but Stan can be more reluctant/troublesome. And threesomes with Seve domming them both is good too. Public use in a locker room? Exhibitionism where someone might come by? Seve having Stan help him double-penetrate Fed? Seve making them play practice sets with his come in them? Get as FILTHY as you like! :D

(If you are totally on board with Seve/Fed but can't make Stan work, you can leave him out.)

If this isn't something you want to write, then gen teamfic or vanilla Fed/Stan shippiness based around Davis Cup is fine too.

My DNWs are Fed topping and/or being dominant, any mention of WAGs, anyone involved angsting about whether this is Decent, and paralyzing injuries/concussions/amnesia/death.

Benjamin January Mysteries - Barbara Hambly 
Benjamin January, Hannibal Sefton, Rose Vitrac January

Some of my favorite things about this series are the amazing historical detail and world-building, the treatment of complex real-world issues, and the kindness and respect and love of the characters for one another, as well as their humor and total dorkiness. I love how huge the world is; you could write a story about any background character and I would be fascinated by it. With Rose, I love her determination and stubbornness to have the life she wants, and how she's capable of being utterly ruthless when the situation calls for it. I also love her awkward, logical kindness. She tends to prefer books to people, and I am SO THERE with her. I love how cool and unemotional she is in a crisis, and her wry sense of humor at others' more dramatic emotions.
With Hannibal, I love that he is SUCH a fucking failbucket, and yet utterly aware of it, and how he's so grateful to those who are friends with him anyway. I really like the times when he manages to subtly undercut the privileges of his position compared to the others. I love how he makes friends with absolutely everyone he meets, and I love the slow growth over the series of his natural empathy, from a passive, fatalistic sympathy to actively going out of his way to do what he can for others. 
With Ben, I love how he is justly angry about the world he lives in, and yet how he manages to take that anger and turn it into working to make change happen. He has intense abandonment issues, and I love how important friends and family are to him, and how he is constantly striving to build a community around himself. I love his sense of pride, the way his desire to be seen as proper and respectable conflicts with his frequent attraction to people who are outcasts in one way or another. I love how good he is at code-switching and making people see what they want to see; he is a good man, but godDAMN he is sneaky when he needs to be. 

Optional Prompts:
– I would love a first-time, getting together fic for my OT3 set immediately after Crimson Angel. It’s such a dramatic book, with a ton of lovely tender moments between all three of them and so many fun tropes (Rose pretending to be Hannibal’s concubine! Ben thinking Hannibal was dead! Dramatic rescues! Bullet wounds!) and I really would love to indulge in even more of it. 
– I love canon-divergence AUs. One idea I was considering: what if Rose hadn’t been pregnant at the time of The Shirt on His Back? Would she have traveled with the others to Oregon? Or would Hannibal have stayed in New Orleans with her, leaving Ben and Shaw on their own? I would LOVE to see crossdressed Rose exploring the Wild West, but Rose and Hannibal forced to deal with his withdrawal on their own and despite societal disapproval would be excellent too. 
– EPISTOLARY FIC PLZ. I always love it when Hambly includes notes written by the characters in the books; I’m so fascinated even by little details like how they address one another (‘amicus meus’ is so cute it kills me) or how they manage to include secret messages that outside observers wouldn’t understand (whether that’s slipping into Latin or Greek, or codewords, or Shakespeare quotations). They do send a lot of letters and short notes in the books, and I’d love to see more of them: Hannibal’s letters from Mexico, Ben’s letters from Oregon or Washington DC, short notes during a normal day around the city, whatever.
– Loyalty kink: there’s a lot of moments in the books where one character has to simply trust that another won’t betray them, because they’re unable to talk directly due to outsiders listening in or them being separated. There are so many societal factors holding these characters apart, and I love how they work around them (usually subtly and sneakily, but sometimes very blatantly!) to maintain their trust and friendship. This is my JAM. Especially if one character goes through a period of angst, believing they might have been betrayed or abandoned, before the other(s) proves their loyalty by coming through with a happy ending. Examples from canon: when Ben is afraid Hannibal has abandoned him in Sold Down the River, before finding out that Hannibal was really kidnapped; in Dead Water, when Ben and Hannibal are unable to speak directly to one another to maintain their cover story, and are confronted by Molloy and Davis unexpectedly. The way they manage to back up each other despite having no plan is delicious. I just want to wallow in a ton of angst and loyalty and trust.
– I realize she’s not nominated, but I would also LOVE to get fic from Livia’s POV. Either backstory (a story about her as a child, as a young woman, from when her children were young, etc) or her view on a scene from canon. Or what does she think about Rose, about Hannibal, about the OT3? 

PS: I have already read 'Murder in July', so if you want to include details from that one, feel free!

Underground (TV) 
Cato (Underground), Georgia (Underground), Rosalee (Underground)

I am so, so sad about this show getting canceled (though I am holding out hope some other channel picks it up!) and so I would love fanfic as a chance to spend a little more time with these characters. I love the heist take on the material, I love the big action sequences, the huge twists in practically every episode, the gray morality and that there are no clear lines between "good" characters and "bad" characters. I love the exploration of an underserved area of American history, but I also love that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is willing to have fun with these characters and their melodrama. 
Cato is probably my favorite character (though I love the others as well!). He’s completely self-serving, ruthless, manipulative, cunning, and I love that about him. I love his dry sarcasm and the way he’s constantly pushing at others, testing them, testing himself. I love how he refuses to trust anyone else, and the way we learn he’s been hiding a deep loss all along. I want to know why he does what he does, what's driving him –&nbsp;though I suspect even he doesn't really know. 

&nbsp;

Optional Prompts:
– Backstory about Cato, since we know so little of his past. What was his relationship like with Noah before Episode One? Had he ever interacted with Rosalee before (it seems likely, since they both have relatively elevated positions)? What about his family or childhood? 
– The episode in Season One where Cato and Rosalee dressed up and pretended to be rich was THE BEST THING EVER. I would love a missing scene set during that time, or an AU where they had to stretch the deception out longer. What if they’d had to spend the night together? Just tell me more about their awkward intimacy! :D
– I'm pretty fascinated by Cato and Devi's relationship. I want to know all about it –&nbsp;what does she see in him? what does he see in her? Fic about their time together while Cato spends fortunes and self-destructs across Europe would be GREAT. I'd also be completely head-over-heels for any backstory about Devi: her childhood, her previous relationships, why she decides to follow Cato to America, any of that.
– I totally ship Georgia/Elizabeth and fic about them would make my day. Fluffy, angsty, first-time, established relationship – any way you want to go with it would be awesome to me. Georgia backstory would also be great: how did she come to make the choice to pass for white? What was her husband like? What is her relationship with John Brown and family like? 
– On another note, I absolutely love Clara and would be so very very into fic focusing on her. She's another deliciously ruthless character, and I am really enjoying seeing her learn how to get power and use it.

Books of the Raksura - Martha Wells 
Chime (Books of the Raksura), Consolation (Books of the Raksura)

This is very much an OR request (though if you can think of some reason to have them in the same room, I'm all for it!). In fact, I really love all of the characters in the tag set and would be happy with fic focusing on any of them; these two are just my favorites, which is why I chose them. 
I love this fandom for its incredible worldbuilding; every single one of the books has some setpiece that just fascinates me with its originality and weirdness, from a city inside a tree to underground pyramids to giant sea-turtles with cities on their backs to, of course, the Raksura gender/caste politics. I also love Moon and his struggle to understand Raksuran culture and the emotional difficulties of being part of a family and a colony; I love Chime's sweet awkwardness; I love Consolation's determination and misguided attempts to do good. 

Optional Prompts:
– I'd love more about Chime's transition from Mentor to Warrior, and all the many ways he must have had to adjust: mentally, physically, socially, etc. It might be interesting to see someone else's POV on that change too, or more about other people who have made the same change throughout history.
– Chime and Moon are obviously together, and Moon and Jade, but do Chime and Jade have any particular closeness? I'd love more on what they think of each other, or just see them spending time together, alone or with Moon as well. I could see this being either platonic or sexual, so feel free to go either way.
–&nbsp;I know this is probably what everyone will be asking for this Yuletide, but I am SO FASCINATED by Consolation. How does her setting up in a tree in the Reaches actually work? What about trading missions with other Raksura courts? Does she convince a consort to join her, and if so how? Do any Abora volunteer to join them and help them learn how to function? What does the next generation look like?
– I'd love a fic about Consolation as a young child. Maybe even from the POV of her father? What was that like, for him or for her, growing up in a place where they only had each other to understand them? A scene about her getting her name would <i>break my heart</i> in the best of ways. Or maybe a story about the father trying to teach her about the Raksura? Or one about Consolation making allies among the Kethel for the first time?
– I also really love Delin, and anything about him interacting with the Raksura would be excellent. Him asking questions to write his book? Him explaining to them about the Golden Isles or some other culture? Him helping out when they get into a tangle with another Raksura court? Just give me this fearless old nerd man and his curious lizard-bee friends and I will be ecstatic! His exasperated family is also A++.

PS: I have read all the short stories and also Martha Wells's Patreon, so feel free to include details from there as well!

A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara 
Jean-Baptiste "JB" Marion (A Little Life), Jude St. Francis (A Little Life), Malcolm Irvine (A Little Life), Willem Ragnarsson (A Little Life)

I would like a fix-it fic. Is that bossy? I can't believe that anyone finished this book and didn't want to fix at least some part of it, so. For any part or portion of any of this novel and of Jude St Francis' life: please feel free to pick the characters you most like, I listed the four friends to snag a match. I would be be happy with any way in which you chose to fix-it: are they women and therefore comprehensive psychological care is (almost) normalized? do they live in the future where induced amnesia is a palliative for trauma, yikes? maybe JB comes over one morning with pastries and talks about art with Jude? did Jude decide to stick around with Ana and go to UCSF and never meet Caleb, or anyone at all? (love the friendship vibes, but can you imagine Jude, trying out recovery, meeting Willem in their forties instead of their twenties? It'd be like a Slim Aarons photograph.) Did Malcolm say 'ah, let's build somewhere else' and thus the car accident never happened, and sometimes Willem awakens at night, cold, and wonders who he is? some of these are pretty horrifying as fix-its go, can you believe that Hanya Yanagihara edits the luxury supplement for the New York Times? all those years of writing about artful arrangements and elegant homes, and she just had to break characters who live so graciously.

Dublin Murder Squad Series - Tana French 
Mick "Scorcher" Kennedy, Richie Curran

justice for this ship, they should've banged even though they ended their careers with the one case they worked together. They should've banged, it would be messy and ugly and hurt. Scorcher is my fave character in the books, and I think his choices are interesting. I am intrigued by the problems of masculinity: which, oh wow, there are so many, let's talk about marriage, responsibility toward ill family members, and guilt. Guilt, oh geez, let's talk about civic religion and who feels guilty about what, back and forth so many times like crosshatching for a scar. Let's talk about how they treat women, and if Scorcher is capable of trusting anyone (in a sexy way? or in an unsexy way. whichever!) I really like reading about miserable weather and Richie's lapses of judgment. I love love reading about garden variety selfishness and thoughtlessness. I don't think anything special needed to happen to ruin them, but that it did makes it all the worse.

The Goldfinch - Donna Tartt 
Kitsey Barbour, Theodore Decker

I like the Barbours, I like the bleakness of Theo's life even after the desert, I would love a story with a strong sense of place. I like the kind of drug and alcohol consumption in canon and don't think there's a problem with Theo making poor choices (two scotches and a pill before bedtime? sure.) I like au's and girl!characters:Theo's slump-hearted misery would be the same in any body. (Theo and Kitsey as women are basically a J.Crew ad for lesbianism.) I would love a story with references to art history and paintings other than the titular bird: surely Kitsey at least went to the Vermeer show at the Met? (I really like Kitsey! water-obsessed and pastelized as she is.) I would prefer a story that dealt with Kitsey and Theo within the canon timeline, when they are both making the best of what they're not quite enough happy with, although Theo doubts his ability to be happy with anything, and Kitsey's successes are hard glossy armor over an aggressive drive to never be caught out, it's not that she enjoys her affair, it's that she feels like running a four minute mile when Theo doesn't ask who's calling her. The inevitable ending doesn't have to be inevitable, either, if you like au's? I love reading about ridiculous New York real estate, Theo and Kitsey having an Instagram-worthy breakfast in bed while he's still hungover and she's lying, yes yes yes.

I'd love to see some awkward Robot flirting and some reciprocating from Three (whether he genuinely wants to admit it, awkwardly backhandedly flirts or feels oodles of guilt over it since she is an Android--and not even a sexbot! is up to you....i will welcome all of it) how far you take this ship is up to you but if you can give me some hilarious flirting i will be MOST HAPPY AND GRATEFUL omg *heart eyes* i also would really dig it if Android almost tricked Three into having sex with her and he kind went with it even if he suspected it to be a lie because he is SO WEIRDLY ATTRACTED TO HER AND HE IS NOT WILLING TO OPENLY ADMIT IT OKAY? wow, honestly all of it would be hilarious and adorable . i'm open to fluff and awkwardness and both of them being bad ass.

The Huntsman (Movies) 
Freya (The Huntsman), Sara (The Huntsman)

Hello lovely writer!

I'd love to read a fic where we learn to what extent Freya has emotionally manipulated Sara. I'd love to read how Freya projects her trauma and suffering onto Sara and to what extent Sara was manipulated and how she began the long road to break free of the toxic relationship with Freya.

I'd love to read a conflicted Sara who is part kind/loving towards Freya and part prisoner/deadly assassin loyal to freya to a fault. Freya who she recognizes as mad with need for revenge and self preservation but who also needs constant support. Is Sara the only one who is allowed to hug Freya? To speak closely without worry of retribution? does Freya dine with Sara and the other chosen warriors? does Sara finding herself devoted and defensive of Freya even though somewhere inside she still knows that she much escape with the others? Is there a toxic physical relationship that fills a need for intimacy between both women? How does her last night before her escape go? I'm just really curious here. I'd love it if it was romantically inclined (consensual, dubcon or noncon) or just platonic/friendship/loyalty  i'd just love to read more about this strange bond they have and how life in Freya's ice palace was for her and Sara

Gladiator (2000) 
Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (Gladiator (2000)), Maximus Decimus Meridius (Gladiator (2000))

Was there anything sadder than all of those longing glances from Lucilla towards Maximus?

Every word spoken between them was a tragedy, a happiness that could never be.

I'd love to read a fic where Maximus is still in Marcus Aurelius' favor as General and he really gets to know Lucilla. I'd love to read about Lucilla being young and confident and throwing herself at him in some very subtle ways that only Maximus would recognize.

Let me read about the love affair and happiness that neither ended up with!

(dearest writer, i'm okay with you foregoing an explanation for maximus' wife, or absence of wife but I'd rather not read about adultery... so if it's from their youthful days let them be flirtatious without hooking up, or if it's canon divergent then anything goes! all i ask is that there is no hate towards his wife/family and that it's all very respectful and he honors his vows --only coming close to being tempted to break them--)  I'm also very very okay with canon divergent where maximus and lucilla somehow make things work, or if you stay true to canon... lucilla uses her private time with maximus for sooooooooooooooooooo much good and that they make the guards jealous *G*

The Borgias (2011) 
Cesare Borgia (The Borgias 2011)

So, like a *lot* of people.. I'm *kinda* in love with Cesare...mostly to the point that I can't even pinpoint what I'd actually like to see out of a fic with him.

    So I've narrowed down that I'd like to read a fic where Cesare can pretty much do anything. He could focus on daddy!issues (he has a lot of them), or love on his sister (emotionally and/or physically...incest? sure!), or fuck married women (or Micheletto!) and I'd be soooooooo good with it... with only one catch, that his tight leather pants are mentioned. (and maybe his gorgeous hair)

    So let me summarize. Cesare + anyone + leather pants= EPIC WIN
**mega bonus points if you mention his beautiful hair***

Omg i'm reusing an old prompt from old YT because every year i put it on here cause I will ALWAYS want more Cesare prancing around in leather pants. But this year i'm thinking.. WHAT IF HE GETS A NEW TAILOR, and the TAILOR WHO MAKES HIS LEATHER PANTS HAS AN APPRENTICE WHO IS WICKED HOT and he MAKES OUT AND SEDUCES HIM IN ORDER TO STEAL LEATHER PANTS INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR THEM (or are they on the house? or is the tailor some sexy old man who gets handsy with Cesare in his leather pants during fittings and micheletto notices and says something? (kinda like on friends when Chandler sends joey to his Tailor and there is CUPPAGE) ahahhaa I don't know but let me tell you I never tire of asking for swaggering Cesare in leather.

Rome (TV 2005) 
Atia of the Julii (Rome 2005)

I recently watched this entire series and was blown away by the depth of Atia's character.

    I would love a fic that strips away the pushy, haughty Patrician Atia, and shows a different side that even she never lets us see on the show. The only time she ever looked vulnerable was when Antony broke her heart. I'd love to read whether she actually did love her husband, did she really love him? Did she love him so deeply and then get betrayed? Was it so bad that she told herself that she'd never be weak and in love ever again, and then Antony happened and despite her best efforts she gave in and loved him.

    I want to read about what makes her happy, truly happy. I want her not to worry about Atia the leader of a very influential household. Not Atia the man-eater.

    She seems so selfish and heartless, but she does feel things... she is a regular person (although she'd never admit it) so I'd love to read about her vulnerable, happy side

    Past!fic or Future!fic is great, i'm pretty much okay with whatever pairing. I'd prefer no incest. A story with any one of her lovers, or her husband would be great. Hopefully I've given you enough guidance/ideas to kinda see what i'm looking for lovely writer, but optional details are optional and i've left this pretty open to interpretation. I'm also good with any rating, I LOVE intimate moments where are personal defenses are down (not necessarily sexual, although that's more than okay) just the honestly and vulnerability of intimacy is awesome to read about.

Wonder Woman (2017) 
Antiope (Wonder Woman 2017), Menalippe (Wonder Woman 2017)

so we're all in agreement that when antiope was shot and we saw menalippe fly out to be by her side in sheer despair that we shipped it.. .like we shipped it sooooooo hard

I'm dying to know how these two met and how Menalippe rose to be her Lieutenant. Is it a physical relationship? or did she cry out from loyalty only? was there an awkward point where they were flirting and then had to ask each other out? did Diana help? or is this from before Diana?

Do they have spa days together when they're taking a break from the military? do they go to Hippolyta's dinner parties together? How do birthdays work?

I'm down for anything and everything. G-NC17, whatever you want to work with i'm good with... but I am soooo interested in the loyalty and love behind that despair and subsequent anger towards Steve Trevor from Menalippe when they are at Steve Trevor's interrogation.

I think they'd be great together if, you know, they weren't separated by 2,000 years, a separate dimension, and Ptolemy being dead. If you can finagle a way to write OT3 fic for them, I would be absolutely over the moon.

Other possible ideas: Ptolemy, Kitty, and Bartimaeus meeting in the Other Place, thanks to the mutability of time. Bartimaeus thinking about Ptolemy and Kitty and what it would be like if they met properly. Ptolemy gets resurrected, somehow, and chaos ensues. Alternatively, Kitty travels back in time, somehow, and chaos ensues.

Likes: fairytales (both fairytale AUs and just the general tone and language), quiet intimacy, trust, loyalty, superhero AUs, deep friendships, wrong choices made for the right reasons, get-together fic, 'i hate them but it's complicated', slow burn, focusing on hands, monsters, everyday magic and magical realism, expectations vs reality, fake dating/married, awkward flirting, canon-divergence AUs, missing scenes, metaphors taken as literal

If you want to include sex: body worship, intercrural, teasing, frottage, fingering, oral (esp. cunnilingus), and foreplay are all A+ in my book. I am lukewarm on actual penetration but do your thing

DNW: A/B/O or biological imperative, rape, underage sex, major character death, pregnancy, nonconsensual surgery/body modification, hopeless endings 

I ship them, but boy, do they have some baggage to work through first.

I'd love to read something about them working through that baggage, either becoming friends again or falling in love. I'd love to read about Akira realizing she loves Chinatsu. I'd absolutely love future-fic about the two of them, having come to some sort of understanding and starting out on a romantic relationship. Anything that explores the leader/partner dynamic would be great. And AUs! Space opera AUs, fantasy AUs, fairy-tale AUs...anything along those lines would be great.

'd love to read more about Jen and Aiko, whether it be pre-canon fic with Jen realizing how tantalizing Aiko's thoughts are, or post-canon fic where she's managed to bring Aiko back. Does something go wrong? How do they continue, after what happened at the party? Or a fic from Aiko's point of view- she's known about Jen and Seo-Yun for a while, and Jen never knew. What was that like, catering for that sort of clientele, and being friends with Jen? I'd also love to read more about Jen and Seo-Yuns time together- the parties and the freedom Jen felt, at least at the beginning. And Ma! What is her history, and how does she feel about her daughter? How does she feel about Jen and Aiko's relationship? We get hints, but I'd love a character study.

I ship Jen/Aiko and would love to read Jen/Seo-Yun (or...Aiko/Seo-Yun? What would that be like?). Feel free to get absolutely weird and dark with this fandom. This is a fandom where I'd be interested in smut as part of the story.

hat I'd really like for this story is canon-divergent fic. Whether that be canon-divergent where Vic never appears, or canon-divergent where he's a one-night stand, or anything along those lines, is up to you. I want to see what would have happened if Vic had never come between the narrator and Gloria; what they would have done. Do they work together to double cross their bosses and rise to the top? Does the narrator chafe at being Gloria's second-in-command and grab her own turf? How would Gloria's plans for the narrator have played out? What about the arrangement- would anything have changed if Gloria and the narrator stayed together?

I definitely ship Gloria/The Girl, complicated and messy as it is, and would be very interested in smut for this pairing.
