This yuletide, I'd most like the focus to be on Michael. His family, his early criminal career, his problematic friendship with Trevor, and/or his life in witness protection before the events of the game. Explore the character of Michael in your fic and I'll be one happy recip.

Shosanna Dreyfus

Something set during a missing scene or post-movie (canon divergence is fine, especially to keep characters alive), would be interesting to see. Maybe Shosanna surviving and going back into the 'real world' and the implications of that. Alternatively, I would love something about Shosanna's life between the prologue and her re-appearance on screen.

The Borgias (2011) 
Cesare Borgia (The Borgias 2011), Micheletto (The Borgias 2011)

I would adore a Cesare/Micheletto slash story, whether that's G rated or NC-17, and whether it's unresolved sexual tension, or completely resolved and reciprocated. I know the series ends with Micheletto seemingly going his own way, but I've read The Borgia Apocalypse screenplay, and I know Neil Jordan didn't intend for their partnership to end there, and of course, historically speaking, Micheletto was loyal to Cesare to the bitter end, so I'd love a story that takes that into account, whether it's set before, after, or during their break. I would be happy with pretty much anything that explores their relationship some more, whether that's through a plotty adventure/political scheme or something more introspective/vignette-y. I would truly adore something post-series. I'd love to see how the two of them come back together after everything's fallen apart, if that's a thread you want to follow. How does that happen? Have they changed/matured in the time they've been away from each other? Are there hurts left to heal? Do they fall easily back into old patterns, or are there new things they've realized about themselves/each other? Are they angry? Happy? At peace? Or maybe you'd like to write something far beyond fixing what was broken between them. That would also be wonderful, to see them further in the future. How has their alliance stayed the same/changed/strengthened amongst changing fortunes and other people's duplicities?

Or if you'd rather write something during the series (also great), what are they like together when they're at their leisure? What's it like for Micheletto, always in the shadows behind Cesare, forever watching out for him and the Borgia family? How does his loyalty manifest when he's in the middle of some foul task specifically performed for Cesare? (And here I'm thinking about all the torture, murder and violence he does in Cesare's name, but it could be anything! Ex: What did Giuliano della Rovere ask of Micheletto while he was "undercover" with the Cardinal? Did Micheletto think about Cesare while carrying out della Rovere's commands? Did Cesare think of Micheletto and all the things he was no doubt enduring in della Rovere's house?) How does Cesare view his stray dog? We see lots of evidence of Micheletto's loyalty to his lord, but how does Cesare's manifest? If you want to go dark, that's ok by me. I find some of the more extreme things the two of them have done (to each other and in service to each other) as fascinating and compelling as they are disturbing.

Crimson Peak (2015) 
Lucille Sharpe, Thomas Sharpe

I would love a story about Thomas and Lucille's twisted relationship, of any rating. I'd love something pre-movie, whether that's about their shared childhood, before they decide to bilk (and murder) the ladies of Europe, or while they're conspiring against (and/or poisoning) one of Thomas' previous wives. I am *all* for the tropes of Gothic Romance, and I'm in love with the movie's landscape and atmosphere, so feel free to go as dark and creepy as you like. Perhaps something about the beginning of Thomas and Lucille's incestuous impulses? When did that happen? What was the cause/catalyst? Was their mother aware that they had decidedly adult desires for their own sibling? Was the abuse the reason that Thomas and Lucille looked to each other for love, or was the incest a convenient excuse to hurt them? Or perhaps something about Thomas becoming aware of the depth of Lucille's madness? When did it first manifest? What drove her to kill? How did he become so accepting? How did they hatch the plan to start conning women into marrying Thomas and then murdering them for their money? What was it like living in that house, either as one of Thomas' fated wives, or as Lucille or Thomas, as these plots spun out? What, if anything, tipped his wives off that they were being poisoned/something was going on between Thomas and his sister? What was it like for Thomas, watching Lucille poison his brides? What was it like for Lucille, watching Thomas play the doting husband (while rebuffing any use of the marital bed), yet still coming to her in private moments to consummate their own union over and over again?

Or maybe you want to write more about the ghost angle? How are Thomas and Lucille haunted by what they've done, if at all? Is one of them more haunted than the other? Are they at all aware of the literal ghosts in their home? Is it more a figurative haunting for one/both of them? There's plenty of room to play with the supernatural (or the psychological), and I'd love to see what you can do with it, if you're so inclined.

Eastern Promises (2007) 
Nikolai Luzhin, Kirill (Eastern Promises)

I'd love a Nikolai/Kirill slashfic of any rating. Perhaps post-movie, in the aftermath of Semyon's arrest, if that interests you? What's happened to the family? Who is in charge now? Has Kirill been punished like his father, or is Nikolai protecting him, and if so, what's motivating him to do so? What is Nikolai's relationship like with the FSB now? What are Nikolai's long-term plans? Do they involve Kirill? Has Kirill managed to gain and maintain Semyon's position of power? Has he become the man his father wanted him to be, or is he a different kind of leader? Or is he a leader at all? Does Nikolai stand at his right hand, or is he the puppeteer behind Kirill's rule? Or perhaps Kirill and Nikolai have moved beyond the family to another life? How did that happen? Did Nikolai bring the rest of the family down as promised, or did he turn his back on his responsibilities when he and Kirill left?

Or if you'd prefer something set at *any* time in the movie's continuity -- pre-, post- or sometime during -- maybe you'd like to explore Nikolai's view of Kirill's relationship with his father? (What does Nikolai think of the way Semyon abuses his son? The way he speaks about him, and raises Nikolai up while pushing Kirill down?) Or Nikolai's view of Kirill's relationship with his family (as individuals or as a business; he seemed very fond of his nieces, and not so terribly great as a business man)? If you'd like to write something more intimate, what about an encounter where Nikolai struggles to balance his cover and his (possible) feelings for Kirill? Kirill, of course, is victim and perpetrator rolled into one, so if you'd prefer to explore how that plays out -- maybe through a story from his point of view, or a scenario in which he now wields power over/is subservient to Nikolai -- that would be great too! I love the idea of Nikolai having complicated feelings towards Kirill, whatever that means for him, so long as he isn't simply using Kirill. Please, no Nikolai/Anna. I'm fine with angst, guilt and ambiguity in this fandom, although none of those are required (and I hold out a hope that Nikolai isn't simply using Kirill).

Killjoys (TV) 
Johnny Jaqobis, Khlyen (Killjoys), Lucy (Killjoys)

For this request, I'd be happy with a John/Lucy story, a John/Khlyen story, or a John/Khlyen/Lucy tale. ...Basically, what I'm saying is I'd love any combination of John with Lucy and/or Khlyen. As with all my requests, I prefer relationship-based stories, and I'm happy with all ratings.

I love everyone in this show, but John is my favourite, and I adore his attachment to Lucy (and vice versa). I would love a story that showcases this relationship with Lucy, and how she favours him over the rest of the crew. Is Lucy "in love" with John? Why, and how did that happen? Is it because he is the most invested in her maintenance? Is it because he treats her more like an autonomous being? ...And what about John? How does he *really* feel about Lucy? What kind of bond does he maintain with her? How does he think about her, either before or after their kiss? As a computer? A ship? Or something more? The scene at the end of Season 2, where Lucy tries to prevent John from leaving, nearly broke my heart. What was it like from Lucy's perspective? How might memories of Lucy affect John while he's on the run?

I also love Khlyen. I love how dark and twisted and amoral he is, how detached he is from messy things like emotions and regret, how obscure his motives are for most of his time onscreen, and how he (usually) tolerates the Jaqobis for Dutch's sake. I would love, love, love to see him get his hands on John and -- short of killing or permanently hurting him -- have his way with John. Does he need to physically/psychologically torture John for a particular piece of information? Do they end up trapped alone together, and have to reluctantly work with each other to escape a terrible situation? Does Khlyen simply... abduct John so he can toy with him? There's plenty of room for darkfic and/or some predatory/prey behaviour between the two of them. Maybe John tries to flip the script and get one up on Khlyen? Would that even work? ...If you can work Lucy in as well, I'd be utterly thrilled, whether Khlyen is using her against John (By threatening harm? By altering her program?), or as an asset to get John out of the situation, or as the main "person" searching for John, etc.

Given Khlyen's end in Season 2, and his reappearance in the Green at the end of Season 3, I'd also be thrilled to see what you might do with the Green version of Khlyen, if that's something that piques your interest! Do Dutch and Aneela bring him out of the Green? Is he more like the man he was before he became one of the Hullen? How does Johnny react to that version? Or maybe you want to play with Green versions of Khlyen *and* Johnny? If the Green is a repository of memories, what are Dutch's versions of Khlyen and Johnny like?

Weirdly enough for how obscure it is, Cymbeline is my most favorite Shakespeare play. I would love to see anything that gets more into Imogen's head - what is she thinking as this whole drama plays out? What happens afterwards?

In general I'm more of a gen fan than a ship fan, but I recognize that romance is part of stories already, so have fun. I would prefer no non- or dub-con unless it's relevant to the story and treated very seriously.

While I have fun seeing the overarching plot of this series unfold, I love love love the moments where the sensates wander through each others' lives and get to know each other and just hang out and talk.

How do those of them who haven't told the people in their lives the truth feel about it? Who do they like visiting best, and why? How do they handle someone dropping by during an inopportune moment?

I’d like a happy fic, if it follows the end of the last episode, I’d like the rowdy 3 to escape quickly and be safe.

Or a missing scene where the sharing the bed actually does go somewhere sexual. Or an AU where Benicio does get deported and a broken-hearted Caleb goes to Billy for comfort. I’d be happy with slice of life fic, or a pwp.

Anne with an E (TV) 
Anne Shirley (Anne with an E), Gilbert Blythe (Anne with an E)

<em>So I've loved Anne (and Gilbert) all my life. I've read the series. I've loved and venerated Megan Follows/Jonathan Crombie as Anne/Gilbert. I've fallen for Mandy Harmon and Tanner Gillman in </em>Green Gables Fables<em>. I didn't know if I would love this adaptation. I do. It's a little overwrought at times, but I can't help but feel that Anne Shirley would love that. In particular, I love how atmospheric it is. Anne and Gilbert have been perfectly casted, and I hope the series lives long enough to see this version of these two fall in love. I love that this adaptation has given a little more nuance to their early relationship: Less of Gilbert admiring Anne from afar; more complexity in both their feelings.</em>

For fic, I'd love to see what happens next with Gilbert. How does his absence affect Anne? What's it like when he returns? Do he and Anne connect or does a misunderstanding slow the growth of their friendship? Does Gilbert stay with family? Or does he perhaps become the Cuthberts' boarder for a period, forcing Anne and Gilbert to forge a friendship… or at least, a truce?

I'm also interested in future!fic: What do this Anne and Gilbert look like when they go to Redmond? What does it look like when Gilbert first falls in love with Anne? What do her feelings look like? I have a fondness for modern AUs, too, if that's something that interests you.

  <em>I loved Helene from the moment she found Elias in the catacombs. She's competent—a trait I adore in characters—and resilient. I love that she's honest, even blunt at times; and I love that she's loyal, even if she struggles with divided loyalties. So far, her relationships with Elias and Avitas interest me most, but I would love to see more of her with Laia. I would also like to see Helene interact more with the worldbuilding, particularly the jinn and the fey.</em>


For fic, I'd like to see Helene evolving more. If this means interacting with the fey or the jinn, that sounds fantastic to me. War is brewing. Perhaps that takes her to strange borderlands, where the fey have begun encroach? Or maybe Helene must travel somewhere with the Augurs?

I'm most invested in Helene's relationship with Elias. I prefer Helene/Elias to Laia/Elias. But I also love Elias and Helene's friendship—all that history!—so if you prefer them as friends, that's great, too.  I'm also interested in Helene's relationship with Avitas. I'm not sure they could work as a canon romance—he did torture her—but I'm definitely here for fic for it, if that's what you're into.

If you'd like to include Laia, I would actually love to read about Helene and Laia having to travel together and rely on each other to survive. I'm also curious about how Helene and Darin would get along.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Michael (The Good Place)

<em>Definitely my favorite ongoing TV series! For a show that barrels through its plot, </em>The Good Place<em> doesn't skimp on heart or details. I love that this show surprises me week-to-week. I love all of its puns, all of its characters, and all of its twists. The worldbuilding has been so great, and I'm excited to see where the show goes with it. Eleanor toes the line between relatable and terrible, and I never knew how much I needed Ted Danson as a demon.</em>

I mentioned in my intro that I'm open to any rating this year. <em>The Good Place</em> and Eleanor/Michael are a major reason why. I'm open to—no, I'd LOVE—for Eleanor and Michael to develop complex feelings toward each other… But I'm JUST as open to feelings not factoring into it. In particular, I'm interested in fic that isolates Michael and Eleanor from the others, if only for part of the fic. (See letter for prompts and ideas.)

I'm also open to worldbuilding. In the pilot, Michael describes the Good Place as "the next phase of [Eleanor's] existence in the universe." What comes after the Good Place/Bad Place? Are these more like purgatories? What about morality of demons/angels? Obviously, demons torture humans—and most openly enjoy it—but Michael seems to have an objective understanding of just how terrible a person Eleanor was. Are the Good Place/Bad Place temporary for nonhumans as well?

<em>This series needed only 3½ minutes to steal my heart: Dutch and Johnny's teamwork; their ease with each other; and of course, their wonderful banter. As the universe of </em>Killjoys<em> grew, so did my love for it—for the worldbuilding, for Lucy, for Pree, for Alvis. For Pawter. She came to love Westerly and its people—from princess to martyr.</em>

As for fic, well… One thing I loved about the first season finale was that it seemed like the beginning of something. If I could change anything about season 2—besides Pawter dying, of course—it would be that Westerly managed to rise up more on its own. I speculated once that the Scarbacks would factor into that, and I would love to see Pawter teamed up with the Scarbacks in a canon divergence fic.

Alternatively, I'd just love to see canon divergence fic where Pawter survives season 2. How does she impact the story in season 3? Does she remain on Westerly? Does she officially join forces with the Killjoys? I'm interested in worldbuilding as well, so perhaps Pawter learns more about the Hullen and all of that.

I'm interested in several possibilities, as far as fic goes. First, of course, what happens after the bus? Does their relationship survive? (I'd like to think it does.) If not, are they able to move on? Or are they drawn back into one another's lives again and again? I'd definitely love to see them thrown into another situation (or two or three) like this one, just to see them working together again.

Alternatively, I think one of my likes would be great for Annie and Jack. For example, Annie, Jack, and an alien invasion? It's like <em>Speed</em> but more apocalypse-y. I really, really love time loops (if requesting <em>The Good Place</em> didn't give that away), so that could be fun.

I love these ridiculous movies with every fiber of my being and pretty much any fic you want to write about them would be wonderful. Mission or case fic would be great, pre- or post-canon, with some or all of these characters teaming up to rebuild their neighborhoods into something safer and more just for everyone. Or you could dig into their backstory: How did Leïto earn the ire of the gang leaders in the banlieue, and how did he look out for Lola as she grew? How did Damien earn his reputation as a Parisian supercop? Where on earth did Tao come from and how did she rise to power in her gang? I also ship Damien/Leïto and Tao/Lola and would be thrilled by shipfic for these pairings or for any other combinations of these four characters (except Leïto/Lola - no incest, please). Anything that played around with undercover/disguise tropes would also be incredibly delightful.

Gentleman Bastard Sequence - Scott Lynch 
Maxilan Stragos

I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS GUY. As foolish as Stragos was to think he could out-scam Locke and Jean, I think that he was probably right about the dangers of magic and the need for ordinary humans to harness greater knowledge and skill so they can stand firm against the greater, more mysterious forms of magic that are moving again in the world - particularly in light of some of the things we learned about the Bondsmagi in The Republic of Thieves. I want to know what in the world led him to arrive at this conclusion, because I don't think a person ends up hating magic that much without having encountered it up close and personal, and probably in a pretty dramatic and unpleasant way that would make a great story. Did he tangle with a Bondsmage and lose? Or did he get closer to the Eldren than the average person and reacted with terror and loathing to whatever he saw? I'd love anything that gave me a glimpse into his backstory and the influences or experiences that led him to adopt his rather singular set of beliefs.

Hunter: the Reckoning 

Tell me about your character. No, really! I leave this prompt wide open for you to give a glimpse at the adventures of any Imbued hunter whose adventures might capture your imagination. If you want to write about any of the canonical NPCs from the game fiction, that's awesome, but I am equally happy reading a story about the heroics of a totally original hunter who hears the call of the Messengers and decides to do something about it. Mercy creeds are my favorites (Innocents specifically), and I'm especially drawn to hunters who strive to reconcile with or understand the so-called monsters that surround them. Hunter-monster friendships and romances are of enormous interest to me, whether or not they end happily. More than anything I'd just like to hear the story of one hunter, any hunter, who takes a stand against evil, and how that turns out for them in the end, whether their mission ends with success or tragedy or both. Pretty much the only thing I would NOT want to read about here is a main character who views being a hunter through a fundamentalist Christian/fire and brimstone/Rapture/Book of Revelation type lens. Otherwise, have at it!

Kreia is an endlessly interesting character, and one of my favorite antagonists in any videogame ever.

A pre-canon story would be great, telling me more about the things she did during her time as Darth Traya - or, if you wanted to write something that took place during canon, her reactions to any of the events of the game or her interactions with other nominated characters. You could even go post-canon, with Kreia lingering on with the Exile as a Force ghost to provide her unique brand of mentorship from beyond the grave.

I'm more into the angsty side of the scale, and I love hurt/comfort (with emphasis on the hurt), both physical and psychological. I love concern and protectiveness.

I like challenging a character emotionally, mentally, or morally.

Hori/Kashima fic! My favorite version of this ship is the one where Kashima is her amazing, confident, princely self who loves her grumpy senpai to death and Hori tries to resist but can’t help but be swept off his feet by her BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. Any kind of fic about these doofs finally getting their acts together and figuring out their feelings and maybe even successfully embarking on a romantic relationship would be amazing! I also love future fic, AUs, basically EVERY kind of setting, I’m not picky in the least. Bonus points if you write from Kashima's POV! Alternatively, if you don't want to write shipfic, Kashima-centric gen fic would also be good. No excessive angst/tragedy, no non-con, no pwp if you can help it, please. More in letter!

Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers 
Mary Wimsey (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers), Charles Parker (Lord Peter Wimsey - Dorothy L. Sayers)

What I would really love this year is something focused on Lady Mary, or on Mary and Charles both.  She's such a fascinating character! And she gets so little screen time, overall!  And Charles is fascinating too, and gets more but still not as much as I want him to.

Some ideas: What was it like for Mary to adjust to life as a policeman's wife, and for Charles to adjust to marrying into the rich aristocracy?  (Sayers just gives us a few quips and a bit about the household budget, but I feel sure there's more to do there!)  Does Mary ever get the detectivin' urge herself, or does she turn her share of the family brains to other pursuits?  She's clearly more like Peter than like Gerald, but she's not just a female carbon copy of him, of course.  If you felt like doing something plotty in which Mary Encounters A Mystery Or Takes On A Cause, I would be thrilled to bits, but I would be just as thrilled by something quieter showing Mary and Charles's daily life.  We see so little of it; even their courtship is really almost entirely offscreen, despite the fact that it happens over the course of a book.

I'd prefer a fic where at least part of the action takes place after their marriage, because that's the time I'm most interested in, but you're more than welcome to involve her younger days too if you want.  Also, I didn't request Peter or Harriet or the Dowager Duchess or any of the rest, but please don't take that as any indication of dislike for any of them!  I love them all.  It's just an indication of where I want the primary focus to be.  Anyone you feel like putting into the fic too as secondary characters, you should feel more than free to toss in.

Power Rangers (2017) 
Trini (Power Rangers 2017), Billy Cranston (Power Rangers 2017), Kimberly Hart (Power Rangers 2017), Zack Taylor (Power Rangers 2017)

Things I love about this glorious nonsense movie include (but are not limited to):

- the amount of glee it takes in everything it's chosen to be
- the respect it gives every one of the kids for their own perspective and struggles; we know they're going to end up a team, but the narrative doesn't blame any of the kids for taking their time about that decision or having conflicted feelings about it
- TEAMWORK
- HAVING FUN WITH SUPERPOWERS

I think my favorite part of all, in a movie full of favorite parts, is the montage of the Rangers using their new powers to... pass notes in class and fight over a piece of doughnut and so forth, and just having FUN with it, together.  If you can capture that, I will love your fic forever. 

Beyond that, I'm honestly up for just about anything!  The Rangers take on more bad guys?  The Rangers just kick around town figuring out what's next and hanging out and secretly being superheroes?  Flash forward to a few years down the line?

A couple of notes: I don't object to any intra-Ranger ships (though please respect Trini's queerness, however you want to play the details of that), but I'm also not especially invested in them.  Feel free to write any combination of Rangers as dating, friends, or anywhere in between.  Also, feel free to focus on a single Ranger or on a smaller subset or on the entire team, as you like, but I'd like at least a background awareness that they are a team now -- and that they have family ties and friends outside, too.

I left Jason off the list because I could only pick four and I felt that his story got told the most in the movie, but I love him too; definitely don't feel you ought to leave him out of the ensemble!

Ernest Shackleton Loves Me - DiPietro 

OH MY GOD THIS RIDICULOUS PLAY.

Okay, I can think of two general fic options here (which are not mutually exclusive):

1) Kat post-canon.  How do things go for her and Alex?  Does she make any more improbable connections (romantic or otherwise) across time and space?  If so, is that when she needs another boost... or is it her turn to inspire and give pep talks to a historical figure?  (Or just someone in her daily life?)  Or both?  (Does Ponce de Leon ever pop out of her oven again?)  The main thing I'd want is for her to remember the lessons that she learned in the course of this play, and for her future to not be relentlessly mundane.  I don't mind if you keep some ambiguity about whether this actually happened or was all just a weirdly vivid sleep dep hallucination/dream, or even decide that it was the latter, but I'd love some amount of the freewheeling wackiness of canon preserved.

2) Sir Ernest Shackleton.  Just how many people struggling with the challenges of life has he given pep talks and life-changing possibly-hallucinatory field trips to, anyway??  I HOPE THE ANSWER IS A LOT.

Both of these prompts are of course rife with crossover potential.  If you feel so inclined, I would be delighted to see either or both of them making connections with other canons!  They've already bridged time and space and mortality; what's a little question of universes or a fourth wall?

The Raven and the Reindeer - T. Kingfisher 
Gerta (The Raven and the Reindeer), Janna (The Raven and the Reindeer), Mousebones (The Raven and the Reindeer)

I loved a lot about The Raven and the Reindeer, but I really wanted the ending to take more time with exploring what comes after all the frantic death-defying struggle.  Let's see Gerta with the herd that is her village!  Let's see Janna adjusting to life there too!  Let's see their relationship in the day-to-day when they have other human beings around and it's not a fierce struggle of an epic quest together, and let's see them figuring out how to make it last in that new context!  Do they, in fact, stay in the village, or come back after they go to the coast, or voyage on, or what?  And what does Mousebones think of all of this, and what does everyone else think of Gerta having picked up a bandit girlfriend and a raven?  There was so much building towards that question of belonging and coming home and balancing how others see you with what you know in the core of yourself, and then we didn't get to see Gerta's own homecoming, or Gerta and Janna in the everyday.  I want more! 

As with my Lord Peter request, any other canonical characters you want to throw in, you're more than welcome to, but it's entirely up to you and the story you want to tell.  (Though I would like to see Gerta's grandmother at least a little, if possible.)

甘々と稲妻 | Amaama to Inazuma | Sweetness & Lightning (Anime) 
Inuzuka Kouhei, Yagi Yuusuke

Likes: Romance, happy endings. Angst is fine as long as the story eventually ends happily. For gen, I have a soft spot for stories about family or friendship. For both romance and gen: humor, drama, hurt/comfort--it's all good, as long as it ends happily, or at least hopefully. 

Dislikes/squicks: Character death, noncon, BDSM, infidelity, mpreg (not really expecting that in these fandoms, but just to be on the safe side). Also, it's not a big squick, but I'm not really into threesomes--I'm more into the "two people find true love" trope.

Prompt suggestions: Kouhei/Yagi slash--with cooking is a bonus but not necessary. Or Kouhei and Yagi friendship fic. Maybe Yagi gives Kouhei a cooking lesson.

The Defenders (Marvel TV) 
Jessica Jones (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Luke Cage (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Matt Murdock (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Danny Rand (The Defenders (Marvel TV))

The Defenders was pretty much non-stop shenanigans, so I would love to read some down-time fic for them. Coffee-drinking, plain old drinking, quiet nights with nobody getting shot or kung-fu fighting. The calm before the storm. 

While Luke and Jessica are my ship, I love Claire Temple so no need to go there if you don’t want to. On a related note, Matt Murdock and his manpain is always welcome so feel free to resurrect him in whichever way you find most appropriate so that he can somersault his way into things.

You're The Worst (TV) 
Lindsay Jillian, Edgar Quintero

Edgar and Lindsay's slow walk from are-we-Rhodas? meet-ups to their current friends-with-benefits relationship that is clearly much deeper and more loving than they're letting on FASCINATES me. They're oddly adorable, despite all the terrible shit that goes on around them and is sometimes perpetrated by them. I want more of their off-hours interactions, whether it's porny or talky or both. I'm into their story; what they're becoming.

I’m super into this fucked up pairing. There’s a lot of potential with Letty and Javier to go either extremely dark or the opposite. It’s that flexibility that I enjoy; either choice fits. I love pulpy noir and I love romantic comedy and there’s plenty to mine from both genres for this show. 

Feel free to do case (con?) fic or ignore that completely and have them off on a non-working vacation. They have such specific skill sets, I’d love to see them working together on a job without regrets.

Dear Author,
You rock unknown author person! Thanks so much for writing for me! Yuletide is my favourite time of year~ I love getting random fics and I hope that you'll like writing in my prompts. 

As a general statement I really, really like fluff and happy things. All of my prompts can have comedy and humour elements and I'd really appreciate it if they did. Laughter (and fandom) is what makes life not suck! I love reading about people coming together as families, friendship, being nice to each other and people (and authors) having fun. Animals, pets, people bonding over pets, cooking (but not cooking the pets) and knitting (potentially for pets) are also appreciated plot points.

<b>I AM ALSO A HUGE CROSSOVER/AU JUNKIE. </b> I love seeing how people interpret characters in new ways and novel situations and I would be totally cool if you wanted to add crossover/au elements to ANY of my prompts. I would request that you crossover with another series that I know (feel free to look at my AO3 bookmarks to see), but that would be totally awesome, like WOAH. AUs, magical realism, alternate histories and fourth wall breakage are all totally cool (and brilliant!) as well.

Regarding romance, I am always happier to read about the relationship build up than I am the sex, so I would appreciate it if things stayed in the G&gt;T range (leave space for fandom!Jesus please). I am totally cool if you want to push things higher to allow for adult language/action (maybe even some heavy petting), but I'm really not a fan of PWPs. I would much prefer a fic about the characters hanging out and watching movies than them making a porno (unless it was ridiculously adorable!).

<b>Serious squicks for me are dubcon, non-con, assault, bullying, embarrassment, gaslighting, bestiality, and politics.</b> I am pretty picky about my pairings (I mean who isn't?) so I would ask that if you are thinking about romance and it's not for a pairing that I mentioned, please make it G or open for interpretation.

Regarding character diversity and re-interpretations, heck yeah. LGBQTAI it up. Make up new racial identities. Why not Rule 63? I'm totally open to you playing around with this too.

If I had a magical power it would be summoning; cause then you get a ton of friends with crazy ass magical powers. Not sure if that's useful, but I'll leave that up to you :)
Now for the prompts!

AHHH!! It got accepted! I would love, love additional bottle episodes of our favourite trash lords and their bumbling adventures through the galaxy. I am particularly a HUGE fan of Lyntel and Bacta (&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3) and would love them trying to corral the rest of the Mynock crew into doing something constructive (Like not making awful choices; 'Hi, I'm Leenik *$&amp;^#ing Geelo'/ The card says 'sex.criminal' lady) or maybe them spending a well earned day at the spa with Nemo or waterpark with Tamlin. Or maybe they all have to break into a highschool for reasons!
Inclusion of the Evil!Campaign crew and all side/secondary characters is welcomed as well (with the exception of Jacinto Reth *shudders*)! OMG I'm already so excited!!
Please Gen to T - I'm not a big fan of any of the romance plots getting serious (although Zero/Blue - yeah ok). The Mynock!Family is pretty much my OTP for this series.

I would love fic about the "day in the life" insanity that is so often alluded to in this series. I mean Ryan doesn’t just spend his whole down time sitting in his room now with his cat, right? And not just 'cause that's an awful place to hide from Levi. I am a HUGE fan of the creepy adorableness that is Nurse Johns. Really anything with this cast would be much loved. Regarding relatioships, I am particularly partial to Ryan/Akmazian, since whoa, especially if it’s brought about by interference help from nurse Johns or Levi.
I would also be happy to see what life is like for the other people on the ship, I mean – Ryan now has a cat, is there a vet on the station? How do you register an illegal pet so you can take it to the vet? Is there a groomer on board? Is that a lucrative side business that Levi might try to get into?
Please Gen to T, unless it’s Ryan/Akmazian (then it’s all good!).

I mean we’ve seen Pedro, but there must be other teachers who work at that school and some of them must know something weird is going on (seriously they all know what's going on).
My preferred characters are M-21, Frankenstein, Rai and Tao, but Shinwoo’s gaggle are also welcome additions.

Craft Sequence - Max Gladstone 
Caleb Altemoc, The King in Red, Elayne Kevarian

I love the complex relationships between Kopil and Elayne and between Kopil and Caleb--this is an 'or' request rather than an 'and' request, but I'd love to see you write something about any combination of the three of them. What were Elayne and Kopil like, during the God Wars? Does the King in Red ever long to reach out and make amends with Elayne, after he almost loses his city? What kind of relationship does Caleb have with his erstwhile boss, now that he has some measure of independence? (Is it romantic?) Do Elayne and Kopil ever play any active role in the Two Serpents Group--serving on the board, or attempting to influence its major players outside of the office? How does that affect their personal relationships? What kind of friendships can they build, with all they've seen each other do and all of the secrets they've laid bare?

Machineries of Empire Series - Yoon Ha Lee 
Shuos Jedao, Nirai Kujen

I love the idea of Jedao and Kujen as half-unwilling collaborators, trying to plan and execute a revolution through discontinuous lifetimes and intervening wars and the impenetrable maw of the Black Cradle. I love the secrets they have to keep in their collaboration, because each of them is a different kind of madman and can't be trusted with the fate of the Hexarchate. I love the different ways they solve the same problems, the different logical leaps they make and the different intellectual skillsets they bring to the same table. I'd love to see a few glimpses into their revolution, and all of the times when they twitched the strings of empire just a little. (And if you want to write me some ghostsex, I'm here for that, too.)

Aino (Kalevala), Kyllikki (Kalevala)

I'd love to see Aino and Kyllikki banding together after the men in their lives betray them, learning magic, becoming skilled in weaving story and song. I'd especially love a quiet shared-space sort of story where the ladies keep a cottage together and go wandering for long periods in the woods, a story where they garden and herd and and find magic herbs and berries and weave and embroider. I'd also love a story where they go on wild journeys and quests (elaborate bride-quests?) like Väinämöinen and Lemminkäinen get to do. (I would not say no to a little revenge against those guys, either.)

The Penumbra Podcast 
Juno Steel, Peter Nureyev

There are so many things I want for these two. I want to see what Peter's been up to after that night when Juno walked out into the Martian night. I want to see the two of them almost connecting in the months that followed, as the election heated up and Juno sank deeper into despair. But I'd also love to see them reconnect, and to see Juno actually reach a mental place where he can accept what Peter offers. I'd love to see them in an alternate universe--what if they were in one of the Penumbra's other settings, like the Second Citadel or the Painted Plains? (What if Peter were a monster of manipulation, a creature with a thousand perfect faces? Or a traincar bandit who came to America fleeing a failed revolution?) But whatever, whoever, and whenever they are, I'd like to see them in love. Even if it's the kind of love that aches like a wound unhealed.

Ancient Pompeii Graffiti 

I.7.8 (bar; left of the door); 8162: We two dear men, friends forever, were here.  If you want to know our names, they are Gaius and Aulus.

I first came across this website a few years ago and this is one that has stuck with me ever since. It's a simple couplet but I get such a bittersweet and melancholy feeling from it. Two voices crying out from antiquity: We were here! We lived! Remember us! Remember!

Were they just friends? Lovers? Did they grow up together? Or did they meet for the first time the night the graffiti was written? Did they die when Pompeii was destroyed? Did they die together? Did they find each other again in the afterlife? Tell me all about these two dear men and their lives that were so intimately intertwined.

III.5.1 (House of Pascius Hermes; left of the door); 7716: To the one defecating here.  Beware of the curse.  If you look down on this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy.

Boy do I have questions about this one. Was Pascius Hermes the one who placed the curse? Did he pay someone else to do it? What exactly does the curse entail? What does it mean to have an Angry Jupiter for an enemy? Is Jupiter angry for being called upon to curse someone for such a stupid thing? Is there more than one Cursed Defector? Do they have a club or support group or something? How does one who has been cursed go about lifting the curse? What are the paths to atonement? Or are they stuck with this curse for life? Feel free to make this as funny or as tragic as you like.

Is her spirit haunting Donald J. Trump, encouraging him to make more deals with Democrats and enact not horrible policies? What made Kiddo take to Puff and adopt him as her long lost son? And how does Floof Lion deal with the new relationship dynamics? What's it like to be Floof Lion tripping out on the 'nip? Have they ever had to fight off a rival gang who tried to muscle in on their turf?

What is Gangrok the destructor of? Does it require a sacrifice, and if so what? Does Mary-Anne go along with Doris' new conversion? Was she already a high priestess of the cult? Does Gangrok help Doris pay back the gals in Cell Block C or Shifty Sarah? Once Doris and Mary-Anne are free, do they establish a Gangrok revivalist church in town? What is the result of their devotion? Is it just one disappointment after another or do all their wildest dreams come true? At what price? Do they eventually think better of their association with the cult and try to leave, but it ain't so easy? Do things get out of hand, and Doris and Mary-Anne are forced to team up with the gals from Cell Block C to destroy the Destructor? Does Gangrok officiate at Doris and Mary-Anne's wedding?

Big Wolf on Campus 
Merton Dingle, Tommy Dawkins

I have such fond memories of watching this ridiculous show after school. It was always such campy fun (also, I maybe had a huge crush on Merton).
I'd love to see something set either immediately following the end of the series when Tommy and Merton are roommates at collage or something set current day checking in with them 15 years later. If set during college you could explore Tommy's difficulty being a werewolf and going to college or how Tommy and Merton's friendship may change now that they're out of high school. Or if set present day them feeling kinda old running around fighting monsters in their 30s. 
I'm hoping for light, funny, story with friendship or romance. If you wanted to go romance smut is fine. Bonus points if you throw in the “The movie! What happened in the movie?” running gag.

Stanley Uris (It (2017))

I'd really be happy with any kind of Stanley character study. Maybe an exploration of his fear of the painting in his father's office. Or a focus on the coming of age aspect of the movie centered on him. Or more about his friendship with any or all the other losers. Anything, just give him time to shine. It can be set pre-movie or post movie. If you're interested in writing about 27 years later I'd love a story about adult Stanley (if you’re familiar with the book perhaps a story where he makes different decisions).

Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady (1964)), Eliza Doolittle (My Fair Lady (1964)), Hugh Pickering (My Fair Lady (1964))

I think these three ended up with such an interesting relationship by the end of the movie and I’d love to see a post movie fic exploring that. Especially with a focus on how scandalous it is for a single lady to be living with two bachelors of no relation. (I’ve always loved Colonel Pickering on the phone with Scotland Yard being unable to explain his relationship with Eliza).
I’m not so much interested in a romantic relationship between Eliza and Henry but I’d love to see if Eliza can ever get these two to treat her as an equal. What becomes of them? (If you want to write romance I’m fine with Higgins/Pickering considering their meet cute or Eliza actually marrying Freddy).
I like happy or hopeful endings, found family and people agonizing over their relationships and their place in the world.

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) 
Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, Clive Candy, Edith Hunter

I’d really like a story about Edith – her life and experiences were just as interesting as Clive and Theo’s, but we mostly just see her from Clive’s perspective at the beginning and second-hand from Theo later on. Does she marry Theo so she can stay in Germany, because she really likes him or because she doesn’t want to be waiting forever to see if Clive says anything – or a bit of all three? And does she ever regret it? An AU where she survives into the WWII section could be interesting – would she feel as out-of-place in the modern world as Clive and Theo do or would she prefer it once women had more freedom and opportunities? Alternatively, a story where Clive and Theo meet again earlier in WWI would also be good – how would the war situation affect their relationship when it’s not clear who’s going to win yet? Hard to get Edith into that one in person but some mention of how she’s doing and what she thinks of the situation would be enough.

A Canterbury Tale (1944) 
Thomas Colpeper (A Canterbury Tale), Sgt Bob Johnson (A Canterbury Tale), Peter Gibbs (A Canterbury Tale), Alison Smith (A Canterbury Tale)

I like the almost mystical relationship the characters have with the countryside and its history in this film. If you’d like to try taking the supernatural hints a bit further, something where one of the characters sees or hears something from the past or has an encounter with someone from the past – maybe a crossover with the actual Canterbury Tales, or with a real-life figure from that time? I’d also really like a story set much later, when the war itself has become history – if one or more of the characters came back to the same part of Kent, how would they feel about it? I like all four characters equally so any one or any combination of them would be good – I do particularly like the friendship between Bob and Alison and the odd parallels and contrasts between Peter and Colpeper. Alternatively, I’d be interested in how Colpeper and Alison get on after Bob and Peter have left—do they become friends?

Back Home - Michelle Magorian 
Virginia "Rusty" Dickinson

What I like most about Rusty in this book is the way she sticks to her own values but at the same time learns to understand better how the British characters’ experiences give them a different point-of-view, especially in her relationship with her mother. If one or more of her American family visited her in England, how would they find she had changed? If she went back to America later on, what might seem different to her? I’d also enjoy anything focused on her relationship with her mother – perhaps working together on the house after they’ve moved back to Devon. Alternatively, a story about how she settled in with the Omsks when she was first evacuated would be interesting, either from her perspective or one of the older Omsks’ – it must have been just as big an adjustment as the move back to England, even if she forgot about it later.

Aubrey-Maturin Series - Patrick O'Brian 
Stephen Maturin (Aubrey-Maturin - O'Brian), Jack Aubrey (Aubrey-Maturin - O'Brian)

Hello lovely Yuletide writer!

I finished the series this year, and what I really want is just the chance to spend some more time with the characters! Any straight-up fluff and light adventure will make me really happy. If you haven't yet got to the end of reading the books yourself, write me a fun adventure in which Jack and Stephen are Best Friends and I'll be happy. I don't ship them, but I am super into a little non-romantic hurt-comfort. Stephen being rescued by Jack, when he has lost all hope, would be ace!

But what I really want is the chance to see what happens next in the story: I want to see Stephen go home and see a Christine who has changed her mind, maybe even see how they negotiate early married life together (though only if this is done with utmost respect for Christine's suffering in this respect - if they never have sex and just get married, that's fine by me. If they slowly manage to learn to be intimate, also fine. I absolutely don't want to see Stephen forcing or coercing her in any way). Stephen has excellent social skills, and a lot of love and respect for Christine. How does he bring these to bear in helping her to feel comfortable and safe?

I'd also like to see Jack reconnect with Sophie, and adjust to life as an Admiral. He'll wear the power well, but does he miss the adventure? The life of an admiral involves a lot of admin. What is he like when the greatest ambition of his life has been realised? Contented? Calmer? How does he connect with his children, who are presumably now approaching their teens?

Mansfield Park - Jane Austen 
Fanny Price

I have always found this book the hardest to love out of all the Austens, and it's because I never really felt I could connect with Fanny.

But you have chosen this as one of the fics you can write, so I'm betting you love it. I want you to show me what I've missed - what there is to love in Fanny Price.

I'd particularly like to see how she functions as a married woman, how her marriage works and how she copes with running a household. Does she come into her own a bit, with a more secure and stable homelife, and someone who loves her? I want this to be a happy ending, but I've always struggled to see how it plays out happily, so please show me!

Note: please use whichever characters you like - I just couldn't find any others on the drop down menu.

Northanger Abbey - Jane Austen 
Catherine Morland, Henry Tilney

So, although I love Henry, I've always found something just a shade troubling in his relationship with Catherine. He occasionally makes jokes that go over her head, and doesn't feel the need to include her in them, and he has so much more knowledge and experience that their relationship seemed a little unbalanced. 

I ship it, because he's funny and smart and warm, and their love for each other is absolutely sincere, but I'd like to see what their relationship looks like when Catherine has had chance to grow up a bit, and their marriage is a little more equal. I reckon it would be a great marriage about ten years down the line - I think Henry would slip from affection to affectionate respect very easily.

So! Maybe a fun, faux-gothic adventure where the two of them, now an established married couple, get to go and uncover a mystery together? We get to see how their dynamic works when it's a bit more balanced, but still just as fun and loving? We get to see the woman Catherine grows up to be?

Senkou no Night Raid | Night Raid 1931 
Sonogi Yukina (Senkou no Night Raid), Miyoshi Aoi (Senkou no Night Raid), Kagiya Natsume (Senkou no Night Raid), Iha Kazura (Senkou no Night Raid)

This series has so many concepts to explore and yet leaves so much open and unexplained that I'd be happy to see just about any fic idea for it. Why do the characters have such specific limitations on their superpowers (e.g., Aoi's extremely restricted time of usage; Kazura's visual requirement for teleportation, Natsume's moon-influenced clairvoyance), and how have they trained to compensate for them? How did Yukina and Natsume's relationship develop from mistress-and-servant to working colleagues (and the nearest that either of them have to family, by the end of the series)? How did Sakurai track all of them down in the first place? Or if you want to go counterfactual, what would've happened if Yukina was the one to be swayed by her brother's argument, rather than Kazura? If none of these ideas work for you, I'd be happy to see scenes from individual episodes explored in more detail, or pre-canon/post-canon extrapolation about any of the four main characters.

Katou Marika (Bodacious Space Pirates)

Marika has a lot on her shoulders as the captain of the Bentenmaru, so I'd be interested in seeing your take on her relationships with other characters of your choosing, especially in the ways that they help her out without her knowing about it. How much does she trust them to support her? What would happen if one of them got hurt during a pirating job, or some shady character tried to violate the agreement that protects Marika while she's underage? For that matter, how would Marika step in to protect her friends if anyone of them were falsely accused of a crime, or ran into some other kind of trouble? If none of these ideas work, I'd be happy to see missing scenes from just about any point pre-canon, during canon, or even post-canon. (I've seen the Abyss of Hyperspace movie, so something set during it would be great as well.) I'm fine with Marika/Chiaki (and definitely ship Jenny/Lynn), but shipping isn't a requirement for me in this story!

Fio and Gina are clearly the best characters in a film full of already amazing characters, and I would like ALL the post-canon fic about them staying in touch throughout the 1930s and 1940s and beyond. Does Gina act as a secret messenger/transmitter for the anti-fascist Italian resistance, or hide escaping prisoners or refugees? How does Fio end up taking over her grandfather's business, especially if it's in the middle of wartime? Do either of them still correspond with Donald Curtis? Does Gina ever hear from Marco, even if Fio doesn't? What is the Hotel Adriatico like in the early 1950s? Even if you don't want to go too far into World War II intrigue, just the two of them spending time together during a long warm Adriatic summer would be lovely.

Taihei and Keaton and Yuriko having a meal and chatting about family, Yuriko and Daniel having to work together track down a lead or fend off a threat to Keaton while he's off at a teaching gig, Taihei embarrassing his son by telling Yuriko tales of Keaton's childhood, Keaton trying to teach Yuriko one of the survival techniques he picked up in the SAS...I'm open to receiving just any fic for this canon as long as it stays close to the feel of the series.

Belkar Bitterleaf, Vaarsuvius (Order of the Stick)

Oh my god, Belkar and Vaarsuvius. One of my favorite hateships/rivalships I've ever seen in media. That said, I'm fine whether you want to keep it gen or go Bel/Vaar. The one thing I <em>don't</em> want is for them to be super fluffy and lovey-dovey together. Other than that, you're good. Hatred, snark, bickering, spite, grudging respect, snarky friendship, bickering lovers, outright hatesex... all of those get the thumbs up from me!

Anything with humor would be great - bring on the pranks, the snarkfest! Alternatively, you could go for some snarky/bickering-filled hurt/comfort. Or there's always good old-fashioned hatesex. In any case: the more bickering, the better!

Genderqueer/androgynous Vaarsuvius highly preferred; gender-neutral pronouns (they, ze, or even just V) also highly preferred.

Firstly, I'm flexible regarding how you choose to write Santiago and Deirdre's relationship; they could be friends, lovers, friendly rivals, rivals/enemies who deeply respect each other, rivals who find each other aggravating but also attractive (kismesissitude, if you happen to be a filthy Homestuck like me.) I'd prefer if they didn't just straight-up hate each other, unless you're going the hatesex route, &amp; even then it'd be nice if they held some sort of grudging respect.

Here are some things you could explore: how Deirdre and Santiago learned to tolerate each others' ideological differences (for the sake of an alliance, maybe? Or for the sake of a relationship? Or both? Up to you!) 

Something about the both of them having Planetdreams together, perhaps? Or maybe something about how they are both functionally immortal, and how over the decades and centuries they grow closer together, as a result of having few others to connect with who understand the heavy responsibilities associated with leading a faction?

Diana Winthrop series - Kate Chambers 

BACKGROUND: The Winthrop books are a teen-sleuth series (six slim paperbacks from the mid-'80s) set mostly in New York and New England, with "Kate Chambers" being a pen name for versatile writer Norma Johnston -- a fact I didn't learn till much later.  The individual mysteries are dedicated to (and often cleverly plotted in the style of) various classic and then-famous mystery authors, the characterizations are much more nuanced than is usual for this category, and there’s a strong ongoing ensemble cast (including a major and well-rendered secondary character who’s blind).

NOTES: If you are one of the other eleven people who read these books back in the day, you know their niftiness and recognize the characters. If you're not, I recommend the series highly even if it is incredibly obscure.  As the prompts indicate, if – beyond all odds – you do know the fandom, I would not be opposed to romance either between Diana and Brad or her father and Lydian (there being definite canonical hints of the latter in later books).  Alternately, a story expanding on the mentor/student relationship between Diana and Lydian would be welcome, too.

PROMPTS: This is one of my nano-fandoms and my Oliver Twist request -- which is to say, what I'm looking for is simply "more". Give me either casefic or a character moment for Diana and Brad, give me back story for Lydian (or build forward on what canon gives us of the relationship between Lydian, Diana's father, and Diana), give me a 20-years-later extrapolation...any of these will find me a very happy camper. 

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Given that these were set largely in New York (especially since one of the characters is an actual TV news professional), I’d think there’d be a lot of crossover potential for this fandom.  I myself Easter-Egged a much older Diana into one of my Castle stories some while back, but a Gargoyles, MCU, or Young Wizards cross (for instance) would also be entirely plausible.

Gargoyles (TV) 
Demona (Gargoyles), Elisa Maza, Macbeth (Gargoyles), Titania | Anastasia Renard

NOTES: I own the first two seasons on disc, but (like most) ignore the “Goliath Chronicles” episodes.  Sadly, I have read almost none of the published comics, but have consulted the major online wikis and timelines thoroughly enough in the course of writing my own fics that I’m broadly familiar with much of the post-canon-but-Weisman-canonical storyline.

I would strongly prefer a story featuring any two (or more) of the requested characters, but a story focused on any one character is sufficient to fill this request.  Also, feel free to include characters not in the tag set as appropriate for plot and story purposes.

PROMPTS: I didn’t nominate Gargoyles this year, but I’m intrigued by the inclusion of Titania/Anastasia on the character list.  In that light, I would be particularly fascinated by a story featuring Macbeth and Anastasia – presumably this would need to be either pre-series or offscreen-during-series, perhaps during the “World Tour” arc.  (It seems likely that she’d either know of Macbeth or be able to ID his semi-magical nature, but he would not realize her faerie identity. And now that I think of it, was Macbeth actually around to see that revelation?)  Alternately, we saw so little of Macbeth and Elisa together onscreen that I’d also be fascinated by a story in which they’re drawn together, perhaps because both have been strongly committed to law and justice (if at very different times in their respective lives).  One presumes that any encounter between Demona and Anastasia would lead to fireworks, although canonically I don’t think Demona can find out about the dual identity earlier than everyone else does.  And of course Demona and Elisa have their own ongoing rivalry, which would be highly amusing to look at sometime when Goliath is not actually in the middle of it.  (Note that in these last two cases especially, Demona’s “Dominique Destine” identity may be useful.)

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Have I mentioned lately that I’m a sucker for the well-executed crossover?  And that New York is just full of likely prospects (MCU, Young Wizards, Castle, etc.)?  I am thinking particularly of the mischief Elisa and Kate Beckett might get into together, what might happen if Macbeth and any of the Avengers were to cross paths, Black Widow and Demona facing off for some reason, or how “Anastasia Renard” might be drawn into the orbits of either Carl &amp; Tom or Nita &amp; Kit.  Or, now that I think of it, what Anastasia might make of the YW “Alien Study Group” team.

The Ice Ghosts Mystery - Jane Louise Curry 

BACKGROUND: This was a one-off mystery thriller for young readers (this being before “middle grade” and “YA” were categories) published back in 1972, which might best be described as a sort of L’Engle/Trixie Belden fusion (L’Engle for the science-fictional elements, which are clearly in the same neighborhood as Arm of the Starfish and Young Unicorns; Belden for the cheerfully determined family-of-sleuths dynamic).  Curry is better (but not nearly well enough) known for a wide range of children’s fantasy, and I kept hoping for a sequel to this that never arrived.  Curry has been gradually bringing her backlist out in Kindle editions, and at one point this was available that way; I’m not clear on whether it still is.  If not, it’s findable – and a quick read – via the usual used channels and possibly still in larger and/or kid-friendlier libraries.)

PROMPTS: This book is such an ensemble piece that I've not tried to pick among the available characters.  Just give me a solid "further adventures" story -- whether of foiling another Evil Science Plot, coping with school/academic politics, or simply wreaking cheerful familial havoc on some unsuspecting foreign metropolis.  Romance between Oriole and Gabriel is definitely on the table, too – or, perhaps, more ordinary correspondence in which Oriole snarks about the mischief her younger siblings are getting into.

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Yet again, my crossover bias rears its head.  As I note above, I feel a resonance between Curry’s Bird family and L’Engle’s Austin and/or O’Keefe clans – and I have to wonder at what sort of scientific conference (or in the context of what mad-scientific scheme) the Birds and L’Engle’s characters might actually meet one another.

Young Wizards - Diane Duane 
Carmela Rodriguez, Dairine Callahan

NOTES: I am fully conversant with both the “classic” and New Millennium timelines (and happy to receive fic set on either or both sides of that line), and have read all the canonical material *except* THE BIG MEOW and the second ON ORDEAL compilation (although I expect to have the latter finished by the time reveals roll around).  

I would strongly prefer a story featuring both characters, but a story featuring either one will fill this request.

PROMPTS: I chose Carmela and Dairine both because I like them individually and because canon gives us so very little that puts them together with one another -- which I find surprising, even granting the age difference.  I would very much like to see how they interact given an excuse and/or opportunity.  Additional characters welcome; suitably brain-bending crossovers totally welcome but emphatically not required.

With WIZARDS IN PLAY out, we have many of the answers we've wanted relative to Dairine and Roshaun, so I'm no longer deeply worried about excessive angst arising from that quarter.  It does occur to me that Dairine might find it easier to talk to Carmela about Roshaun than to have the same conversations with Nita, perhaps especially now that his situation's been resolved.  (Or you could set such a tete-a-tete earlier in canon, while things are still unsettled....)

Other possible tacks: Dairine getting one up on Nita with Carmela’s help, or the girls and the Alien Study Group having an adventure (I’ve seen a fair bit of fic in this line set in the Crossings, not so much here on Earth).  I would also be very much on board for quality father-daughter bonding -- no matter which father/mentor figure(s) is/are involved.

EXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: If you’ve been reading all the requests in order, you know what’s coming here.  (If not, feel free to skip upstream and come back....)  Young Wizards is by nature a decidedly crossover-friendly fandom; I’ve done just a bit with that myself, and would totally be on board with a crossover here.  To reprise one particular prompt from above: if you’re literate in Gargoyles, I’d be curious to see what might draw Anastasia Renard into the girls’ orbit here (or Macbeth, for that matter, which might lead to some amusing encounters).  And there are any number of other New York-centric fandoms to draw on – if anyone in TV’s Castle is a wizard, it’s probably Alexis, and it abruptly occurs to me that it might explain a lot in the Spider-Man: Homecoming background if Aunt May were a wizard....

If you'd like to get a sense of how I view them, I've both written and received fic about them in the past that covers it pretty well, but don't feel obligated or anything like that -- one of the things I love about fandom in general and these characters in particular is all the different ways they're viewed, so if you've got a solid headcanon, I'd much rather see that than you trying to fit into mine!

Maybe the three of them are fighting supercrime together? Or Will and Warren are superheroes and Layla's off doing her own thing and that's causing tension, or Will and Warren think it's causing tension and Layla's all, "WTF, no, guys, we talked about this, I'm fine, seriously," or just.

<strong>What I'd absolutely love to see:</strong> something involving Briar and Daja's sibling relationship, especially with how they both have 'earth' related magic that is, in practice, drastically, drastically different. I'd also love to see something with these two and different parts of their family: the quartet being domestic in their house in Emelan, after Will of the Empress, or Briar and Daja with Lark and Rosethorn, talking over the table late at night in Discipline (visiting? before everyone goes on their journeys? IDK, maybe after everyone's back would be better). Daja is canonically a lesbian, and Briar is word-of-god non-straight (I'll have links to the relevant tumblr asks in my letter, if you're interested!), so something with the two of them relating on that level could be interesting if you'd like to include that aspect of Briar. (It's not on-page canon, so feel free to ignore it, but it is part of how I view the character.) Primarily, what I want to see is some kind of quiet moment(s) centered around these two and their family, whichever parts of their family you want to include. (Or not; I didn't officially request anyone else, after all!)

Jet and Frances on their own, bantering back and forth, or an exploration of the various spells they do for the townspeople, or... You get the idea, I think. ;) One of the things I love most about the movie (and presumably the book, although I haven't read it) is that it does really well with the folk-lore and folk magic, but more in the sense of, "This is something that feels like it could reasonably be a part of those traditions," rather than, "This is something that SLAVISHLY ADHERES to this material I've researched." So anything with that would be fun, but most especially in the sense of, "I am exploring and expanding and having fun with the magic side of things." SERIOUSLY DO NOT WORRY ABOUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH INTO FOLK MAGIC TRADITIONS.

The Charioteer - Mary Renault 

Quite a lot of fan fiction focuses on the canonical romances; so I'd prefer a story that's a bit different. Perhaps a gen school story or other backstory? Or war-time futurefic: <i>e.g.</i> Ralph's future in the Navy, Laurie after he's mustered out; life for the Straikes &amp;/or Aunt Olive during the war; Andrew with the Friends Ambulance Corps; Alec or Sandy as army doctors (or any combination thereof)? Other possibilities: an insider's view of the Bridstow scene, Bunny getting his comeuppance (or Bunny's p.o.v.), a slice-of-life at the E.M.S. hospital; Ralph in a P.o.W. camp. Feel free to include other characters besides those nominated.

I prefer canon-compliant stories that are gen or character-driven mild romance; but I'm not asking you to ignore canon relationships. However, I don't like anything more than PG13: explicit sexual detail is definitely a DNW for me. I prefer not to have characters die in the story; but references to canonical deaths are okay.  DNW second person fic.

Casefic is always a treat; and I enjoy ensemble stories, both in terms of the interplay back at the station and also the detective story plots. If you prefer to focus on an individual, perhaps family/personal life/backstory (for police characters), or history/backstory (for the vampires, whether Nick's "family" or Vachon's crew). By all means include characters who weren't nominated if you want. I like all three seasons equally.

I enjoy the comic side of the show, too, especially the banter between the two.

I like Heyes/Kid slash, if you're into that.  Either first-time or established relationship is good.  However, I don't care for smut, so please keep to a PG13+ rating. (Even better if you work it into a plotty fic!)

Black Crystal Sword Saga - Ancient Bards (Albums) 
Daltor (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Dorus (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Sendor (Black Crystal Sword Saga), Shena (Black Crystal Sword Saga)

There are links to the canon on my letter page. Also: you do not need to try to write about all the characters I requested.

This trilogy is cheesy. It's shallow, and it's got magic and dragons and laughably thin characters. And I think it's really great. If you want to go a more serious, high fantasy route, do it. If you want to ramp up the cheese and just run with how foolish and incompetent the characters can seem, please do! Feel free to write about any or all of the characters I listed here, and including Alron or Rahed is fine with me even though they aren't on the list. (You can include any extra details from Sara Squadrani's blog posts about this saga or not.)

If it helps at all, my favorite songs from the saga are The Birth of Evil, All That Is True, Soulless Child, Through My Veins, and Hope Dies Last.

Here are some ideas for things I'm curious about:

Daltor - Why did Sendor target Daltor and his father? What was with the whole bear thing? When and how did Daltor learn to tame dragons like that?

Dorus - Just how much autonomy does he have? Is he just a puppet, 100% controlled by Sendor, or can he act on his own at all? What's it like to live without a soul?

Sendor - How did he find out about the black crystal sword in the first place? Or, how did he meet Shena? What was it that brought them together?

Shena - What's a kerim? They're described as "elves of ice," but that's not much to go on. Why was it illegal for her to be in a relationship with Sendor? How did she deal with losing her son and Sendor all in one go (either when Dorus died the first time or second time)?

How did he meet or acquire Thork? What was Goleeta's family like? What was her kingdom like before Tormack? What motivates Tormack?

Or if you'd rather go a world-building route... do it! There's a strange combination of sci fi and fantasy in this world and it doesn't always seem to mesh very well. Why might that be? What happened to this world in the past to make it the way it is in the series?

I'm curious about all sorts of things about this series and its characters. Feel free to go into worldbuilding if you so desire, or write about any of these characters (or any combination of them).

Amaya &amp; Denya - I would love to see things from their perspective. What are they up to while Jess is doing her thing? What do they think of all of the changes taking place in Efea? How did they fall in love and become a couple? What happens to them after Buried Heart? I'd be totally happy with anything from G-rated fluff to explicit femslash.

Agalar - He was such a mysterious character... I'd love to know more about where he came from and those he left behind, and what he will do now.

Bettany - Another mystery. What was it like being the angry one who realized how unjust and unfair the world was in a household where everyone else just seemed to accept it? What will she do after the events of Buried Heart? Can she ever reconcile with her family?

Please do not write me fic for this series where Jessamy and Bettany act out any of the classic twin tropes. I don't want to see them switching places or tricking people by being visually / actually interchangeable, I don't want to see them as halves of some perceived whole, I don't want to see them finishing each other's sentences, and I don't want to see any sort of incestuous relationship between them.

Valeria - What was her life like before she met Conan and Subotai? What if she had lived and carried on with Conan? Or, what if Conan had died and she had been the one to live?

Exiles - Melanie Rawn 
Alin Ostin, Gorynel Desse, Lilen Ostin, Valirion Maurgen

You do not need to try to write about all the characters I requested for this fandom.

I'm definitely curious about background stories, character histories, and world building for this fandom. If you want to ignore my character requests and just go for straight world building, that would be completely fine with me.

I'll be giving basically the same prompt for each of the characters: how did they get to be the way they are when we see them in the novels? What might have been different had we seen things through their eyes instead of being limited more or less to Sarra, Cailet, Glenin, and Collan for POV characters?

For Alin and Val: what's it like not being straight in a society like Lenfell's? How did they first meet? What drew them together?

The Pirates of Dark Water 
Ioz (Pirates of Dark Water), Ren (Pirates of Dark Water), Tula (Pirates of Dark Water), Zoolie (Pirates of Dark Water)

You absolutely don't have to write about all four of the characters I requested, though if you want to, by all means do!

In general - I like plotty, action-oriented adventure stories. If you want to write about the main characters finding another treasure not covered in the show, go for it. If you want to focus more on world building, that works for me, too. I'd prefer it if you didn't write romance, but if you have a great idea that calls for it, I can probably roll with that.

Ren - Does he miss his childhood at the lighthouse with Jenna? What are his plans for after finding all the treasures -- has he even thought that far ahead?

Tula - Were there any hints in her past that she might become an ecomancer? Or was she mostly just a warrior and seafarer?

Ioz - What kinds of scrapes and shenanigans did he get himself into before teaming up with Ren and Tula? I'm sure there are plenty of ridiculous swashbuckling stories he could tell... and some of them might even be true!

Zoolie - What's an average day like for him? What does he think of our brave heroes and their adventures? Or what were some of his own adventures before he "settled down" to operate that gaming house?

Hellboy (Hellboy (Movies)), Abe Sapien (Hellboy (Movies)), Liz Sherman (Hellboy (Movies))

No smut, please. Take your pick if you want to write about all three or not. I don't have anything specific in mind (though I'm fond of the friendship dynamics between these three), so - write whatever makes you happy! Thanks :)

Preacher (TV) 
Proinsias Cassidy (Preacher TV), Jesse Custer (Preacher TV), Tulip O'Hare (Preacher TV)

No smut, please. Apart from that, write whatever makes you happy! Not all the characters have to be involved (though I'd prefer if at least Cassidy was). I'm a fan of friendship-centric stuff, but if you'd rather write something else, go for it. Thanks :)

Star Wars: Doctor Aphra (Comics) 
Chelli Lona Aphra (Doctor Aphra), BT-1 (Doctor Aphra), 0-0-0 (Doctor Aphra), Black Krrsantan

Gushing about ensemble casefic is in my letter. Also gushing about Aphra's tattoos. Uhm.

DNW: Deathfic or droid orgies, because either of those are not something I'd normally read. Otherwise, it's Star Wars, do with it what you will.

The Wolf Among Us 
Bigby Wolf (The Wolf Among Us), Snow White (The Wolf Among Us)

In my letter: rambling about the contrast to the comic and how I just really want stuff set in the game universe so that I don't have to deal with how Fables ended. I am fine with comic-particular characters appearing, though, so if that's your idea then go with it.

DNWs: If it fits canonically into the game or comic then I'm game, just please no perma-death because that makes me sad ):

The Martian (2015) 
Mark Watney (The Martian 2015), Chris Beck (The Martian 2015)

In my letter: Begging for snarky bros being bros. Romance optional, I was just kind of disappointed in the film for cutting out their bromance that was so delicious in the book.

DNWs: If romance happens, please don't assassinate Beth's character? Also, infidelity makes my skin crawl. And uh no deathfic, I guess. Heroes dying make me want save reloads.

Hellboy (Movies) 
Nuada (Hellboy (Movies)), John Myers (Hellboy (Movies)), Hellboy (Hellboy (Movies))

I like Nuada/John or Hellboy/John(/Liz?) or gen.

I love AUs in this fandom, either complete AUs or just "what if"s of what would have happened if John had been around during the second movie and if he could have dealt with Nuada a different way. Or what if the supernatural world never stepped back, but stayed integrated. What if John and Nuada are BRPD coworkers. Let your imagination run wild here.

Die Hard (Movies) 
John McClane, Matt Farrell

I like seeing John and Matt pick up the pieces of their lives after the firesale. I adore stories where they have to move in together for some reason, or where John rescues Matt from some new crisis, or Matt bringing John up to speed on the digital age.

Valdemar Series - Mercedes Lackey 
Vanyel Ashkevron, Tylendel Frelennye

I adore AUs for this, where the boys end up in a happy relationship sans death. Or at least relatively happy. Vanyel will always find something to angst about.
I love seeing twists on the original storyline where things don't go to hell or complete AUs. Things from the novels that I do like being explored: Vanyel escaping his abusive home life, Savil being a complete badass, Tylendel loving Vanyel for the broken boy that he is and filling in the cracks to make Vanyel whole again.

Gifted (2017) 
Frank Adler

I've put only Frank here for maximum matching capacity, but he doesn't have to be the only character or even the primary focus. I'm down with just him, or him with one of the others, or him and Roberta and Bonnie and Mary, whatever you feel like writing, though I can only take Evelyn in smaller doses. I really love this movie and I'll try to write out some possible places to go in my DYA letter, but you can't really go wrong if you focus on Frank and Roberta. I just want to know so much more about them, how they became friends and allies, what's Roberta's story, or what happens with Frank (and maybe Bonnie?) after the movie. He's so changed by the end, how does that affect the way he raises Mary? There are so many places to go with this, so much that's unexplored in the film. Though the movie is pretty melancholy in a lot of ways, I'd prefer not to have something bleak or depressing, especially as regards Mary (and Fred!).

The Adjustment Bureau (2011) 
Harry Mitchell

I loved this movie back when I first saw it, especially Anthony Mackie as Harry, but after he played Sam Wilson I went back to it and loved it even more. I've requested only Harry here, but I'm happy to have him interacting with anyone else, including other members of the Adjustment team or David and Elise, or even characters in another fandom. I'm just really in love with him, he's so gentle and sweet in his sweater vests and cardigans. &lt;3 More details in my letter, but I could see exploring Harry's viewpoint on the events of the movie, or possibly his history watching David and David's father, or what happens after the end of the movie--lots of options! Just more Harry, that's all I want for Yuletide.

Political Animals 
Thomas "T. J." Hammond

I've been so lucky to receive lovely TJ stories the past few times I've done Yuletide. So I feel greedy, but I always ask because I just can't get enough TJ. I love how broken and damaged and hopeful he is, how much he just wants someone to love and to be loved by, and how much of a fuck-up he is. There are a lot of types of stories to write with him, and I'm open to crossovers with other fandom characters (some possible ideas in my letter) as well as the ones in the show, just as long as Sean doesn't have a major role. Most of all, I'd love it if you can give TJ something resembling hope or even a happy ending, and I'd really prefer not to have bleakness, grimdark, or kink, please.
