Log Horizon 
Minori (Log Horizon)

I am in this one for the social engineering. I loved when Shiroe bought the guild building to force everyone to listen, and then I loved even *more* when the second season pointed out that this sort of monopoly could have epically bad consequences, too. I lovelove/love/ Shiroe mentoring Minori, because watching Minori learn how people work and how to put herself forward enough to influence them for the better is wonderful. Anything involving Minori being smart would be perfect (though please ignore the in-love-with-Shiroe bit). I would also perfectly happily take Kanami mentoring Shiroe, if you'd prefer, or any combination of Shiroe, Minori, or Kanami trying to make their world a little better. I'm good with gen, het, or fem/slash here, though I'd rather avoid Minori het.

Psycho-Pass 
Tsunemori Akane

I loved this show for Akane: for her unwavering belief in justice, for her ability to acknowledge that she is choosing what she hopes is the lesser evil and enabling a bad system without it destroying her, for the way that she cares about people but is still complete unto herself. I love her relationships with Ginoza and Kougami, but I also like her mildly antagonistic mentorship of Mika, the way that Kunizuka trusts her implicitly, Shion respects her, Hinakawa adores her, Saiga leans on her, Masaoka both mentored and protected her, and Kagari challenged her. I personally ship Akane/Ginoza/Kougami, but you could certainly convince me of others. Honestly, I will love anything that involves Akane trying to do the right thing, be it in an investigation, in a relationship, in a regime change, or just in a single conversation.

Safehold Series - David Weber 

When I say any here, I mean it. We saw Ahlverez doing a complete 180 on his attitudes toward Thirsk and Charis, and I find him grudgingly changing his mind fascinating, so I'm always happy to see more of him. Ditto Thirsk. I also tend to adore religious reformers, so Samyl Wylsynn and Rhobair Duchairn are fascinating to me, Wylsynn as the person who knew early on that the church needed to be reformed but still wanted to save it and Duchairn as the convert who came to that realization late but threw himself into it. Other characters I'd love to see more of include Paityr Wylsynn (or Hauwerd or Lysbet), Urvyn Mahndrayn, Greygor Stohnar, and Khanstahnzo Phandys, so if you'd rather write about one of them, that is totally good, too.

Thematically, I'd love to see a gay Safeholdian, or characters trying to figure out what to do when they serve a bad leader. Or I am up for basically every fork-in-the-road AU ever in this fandom. Merlin picked a different kingdom (Siddarmark? Chisholm? Dohlar? Sisterhood of Saint Kohdy?); the Wylsynns beat Clyntahn; Hektor died early and the Corisandians have to navigate the Church trying to manipulate young!Hektor; Ahlverez believed Thirsk about Malikai and Charis (and clashes with Thorast or doesn't get sucked in at Alyksberg); or, really, anything you can think of. I am up for gen, het, or slash, though please no incest.

Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu | Legend of the Galactic Heroes 
Yang Wenli

Yang is absolutely my favorite character here, with his brilliance and his diffidence and his ability to inspire people without ever understanding how to deal with it. I would love backstory about his rise in the military, in-series fic exploring his interactions with Walter von Schenkopp or Frederica Greenhill, AU's in which things turn out differently (Yang if Jessica convinced him to help make democracy work, if the surrender transmission were delayed, if he survived). I love the helpless waste of lives that the story conveys, but I'd also love to read fix-its wherein something changes for the better without everything necessarily becoming perfect. But, truly, I love this anime, so political maneuvering, quiet moments, epic space battles, anything goes.

I don't know why this quote came to my mind.

I’m a big boxing and Mike Tyson fan, so we started talking about boxing and I was like, ‘Dude, you’re too young to have seen all this! You have to watch these fights!’ So we went back and pretty much watched a whole bunch of old boxing fights, as you do.

An AU/ alternate canon with Gianna taking her seat at the High Table and Santino grudgingly falling into line (and not dying, preferably!) would be interesting -- maybe Santino still calls John's marker in, but for another purpose, misjudges the entire situation and gets into a scrape? I'd love Gianna being a total badass and saving her baby brother's sorry ass, but also! lots of snark and grudging sibling rivalry turning into mutual respect would be a bonus.

Sydney insisting on collecting almost every stray she comes across and Victor staring in faint despair as their car fills up with more animals; having to sneak said animals past reception at motels, running into other EOs and Sydney making Victor buy clothes that aren't black for once. 

Or, if that isn't your mileage, maybe Eli's perspectives and how he came to be what he was/ his thoughts on Victor and Serena and Sydney?

*I know homophobia/biphobia would/does exist in some of these canons, but I would vastly prefer if you just took the route where homophobia/biphobia is completely a non-issue and is just as readily accepted as heterosexual relationships.

**To expand on my thoughts about bi erasure, I would prefer that if you are writing a same-sex pairing where one or both of the characters was presented with heterosexual inclinations in canon (ie, interest in the opposite sex, opposite sex love interest, etc.) that they be presented in the fic as bisexual rather than gay.

&nbsp;

In the fandom places for the Trixie fandom where I hang out, Dot is a character that often gets torn down for the Jim/Trixie pairing, which I think is a shame. She only appeared for one book (Happy Valley Mystery), had no dialogue, so we don't see much of her personality beyond Trixie thinking well of her after spending some time together and Jim seeming genuinely attracted to her. The most we know about Dot in canon is that she's outwardly beautiful and an excellent figure skater.

What I want is a positive story about Dot Murray being friends with the Bob-Whites. Maybe five times she helped them/gave them advice, and one time one or all of them pulled through for her? She’s vaguely noted as somewhere from two to three years older than the thirteen/fourteen-year-old BWG girls in canon, so maybe a fic where she’s their mentor/the big sister none of them have? Casefic where she helps Trixie and Honey with a mystery, either by serving as their wheels (since Trixie and Honey don't have their licenses), going undercover as honeypot to seduce a guy or gal for information, or something else entirely?

I’d also totally be down for a romance between Dot and any one of the BWGs. Do she and Jim meet up at college and start going steady? Is Dot the sultry singer in a slinky gown, stretched out on the piano and belting out torch songs, at the smoky nightclub where detective!Trixie goes to investigate? 

Dot and Dan are both talented ice-skaters, so do they have a romance on ice? Maybe they’re older and the setup is that Dot is an Olympic figure skater with Brian as her doctor, or Honey as her costume seamstress? Maybe an AU Diana is a fashion photographer whose big break is discovering Dot as a model, or where Dot’s a superhero who has serious chemistry with investigative reporter!Mart? Anything goes, and if you want to write a poly relationship, feel free to include that as well!

Honestly, for this fandom, I just want to see the BWGs being friends or romantic with Dot, so I will enthusiastically devour anything along those lines.

Specific DNW
I realize the Jughead 2015 series presents Jughead as asexual, but I’m not particularly interested in receiving a fic focusing on this characterization. I also would prefer not receive smut for this pairing.

Note: I love all the gang, and I would be completely open to seeing any of them included in this fic. I especially love it when Reggie and Veronica show off their softer sides, and I love this page of Reggie helping Kevin choose outfits for a first date.

If you’re writing friendship fic, I would love something with them just being bros together. Maybe Jughead is there for Kevin when he breaks up with his boyfriend Devin in the original comics? Or maybe Jughead needs a school policy changed, so he goes to class president Kevin for help and they work together to get it solved?

Another pairing I really like is Kevin/Reggie. I'd love to see fic where Kevin is in trouble (lost in the wilderness, gone missing, trapped by a blizzard, etc.) and Jughead and Reggie must put aside their rivalry to rescue their respective best friend and boyfriend.

I would love to see something along the lines of Kevin always picking the worst types of boyfriend imaginable, so concerned friend!Jughead decides to play matchmaker to try to help Kevin date a better kind of guy. Your choice who Kevin ends up with!

In the comics, Kevin was pursued by a secret admirer, who eventually turned out to be this guy named Paul who was totally harmless. But if you like, I'd be interested in reading this plot with a thriller/mystery twist where Kevin is being stalked by his secret admirer and is unnerved but determined to put a stop to it, and Jughead tags along to protect him. Either friendship or pairing fic is fine for this plot.

For a pairing, I think these two are really sweet together. I love the contrast between their personalities, and I’d love a fic that emphasized Kevin as the ultimate overachiever and Jughead as laidback and not at all bothered by anything. I can easily see Kevin becoming super stressed and running himself ragged with being involved in his various activities. Maybe Jughead does something nice to relax him, like plan a picnic or take him to the amusement park? Perhaps he cares for Kevin so much that he’s even willing to ask a favor from Veronica to help Kevin, and uses her influence to take Kevin to a fun concert or similar? Or maybe Jughead just does something to show Kevin he doesn’t have to be perfect all of the time?

Another idea is just to have other citizens of Riverdale commenting on the unlikeliness of the pairing while Kevin and Jughead have fun together. I love little bits and cameos from the various Archie characters throughout the decades.

I just finished the “Over the Edge” miniseries, and I’m really disappointed with Reggie’s characterization so far in this series. This is really how I see Reggie’s character, so it frustrates me to see him written with so few redeeming qualities. Because of this, I’d really like any type of canon divergence AU where Kevin befriends Reggie and helps him reform/brings out his better side and encourages him to be friendlier.

One aspect that does intrigue me about Reggie’s 2015 characterization is his interest in street racing. Maybe either he or Kevin race, and when one of them loses to the other, the winner makes the loser spend the day with them/be their date to a dance, or dinner, or something similar? Depending on what you’d like to do, this could either kick off their friendship or romance.

Another idea is for a friendship fic that concentrates on Reggie’s softer side. Maybe he gets roped in to helping out with a fundraiser or something similar for detention, and he ends up working alongside Kevin, who’s freely volunteering. They begin to bond, and Reggie realizes he actually really likes the work and likes hanging out with Kevin?

Or maybe a cause that’s important to Reggie needs serious aid (perhaps the animal shelter where he adopted Vader?) so Reggie goes to Kevin to help him out, and they work together to save it? Or Kevin winds up in serious trouble, and Reggie bails him out? Just something with Reggie showing that he really is a good guy deep down, and becoming friends with Kevin along the way.

In the classic comics, Kevin was pursued by a secret admirer, who eventually turned out to be this guy named Paul who was totally harmless. But if you like, I'd be interested in reading this plot with a thriller/mystery twist where Kevin is being stalked by his secret admirer and is unnerved but determined to put a stop to it, and Reggie decides to protect him and help him find the stalker. Either friendship or pairing fic is fine for this plot, and if romance, it could lead to them getting together.

I love fics about getting trapped or stranded somewhere, so maybe Reggie and Kevin get lost in the wilderness while on a field trip or stuck in a cabin together by a blizzard? Kevin is shown to be have some experience with wilderness survival, but perhaps he gets hurt or sick and Reggie proves what a good guy he is by taking care of him?

For a pairing, feel free to use any of the prompts above, just with a romantic twist. 

Another idea I'd like to see is Reggie spending time with Kevin, and Kevin is just his friendly self, which brings Reggie to fall for him. Maybe it's a gradual thing and it takes sometime for Reggie to realize his feelings, or maybe Reggie knows what he wants right away. I really like the idea of Kevin becoming involved in all sorts of extracurriculars, and Reggie signing up for them, too, as he realizes he wants to be with Kevin. I would just really like to see Reggie realizing he can let his guard down around Kevin without fear of looking weak or making himself vulnerable.

For gen fic, I’d like to see Kevin engaging in a battle of wits and wills with Stanger. Maybe after Jughead is expelled, Kevin takes their dispute to the next level and tries to use as much as he can to discredit Stanger? And while he’s out trying to dig up dirt to use against him, Stanger knows what he’s doing and is trying to find ways of discrediting him? I’d just love to see a fic about these two trying to outsmart each other and always just managing to escape whatever trouble the other is causing for them.

For a pairing, I’d really like a fic of Stanger just creepily perving on Kevin and trying to “save” him from “troublemakers” like Jughead, Archie, and Betty and isolate him so he can manipulate him. Maybe Stanger has warped standard where he's totally okay with brainwashing teenagers in soldiers but can’t handle the idea of being attracted to a teenager, so he tries to convince himself the reason he likes to watch Kevin during gym class and invites him to private lunches with him is because he thinks Kevin would make the perfect soldier? I think it would be great if Kevin was aware Stanger’s attitude about him was weird but didn’t quite pick up on everything, but Colonel Keller did and instantly rushed in to shut Stanger down and bust him as a disgraced spy. 

Or maybe Stanger takes it up a notch when his plans are discovered by Jughead and the gang sooner, so he has to go on the run and takes Kevin as a hostage, only to find himself strongly attracted to him? Feel free to do something with internal conflict and Stockholm Syndrome on Kevin’s behalf, or just have him nobly fighting Stanger the entire time.

I’d also like a fic with Principal Stanger lusting over Kevin and using some leverage to coerce him into having sex with him. Perhaps Kevin goes to appeal Jughead’s expulsion, and Stanger makes a deal that if Kevin has sex with him, he’ll let Jughead back into school, and then at the end reveals he already agreed with Jughead’s dad to lift the expulsion anyway? For extra angst bonus points, Kevin could have an unrequited crush on Jughead, and Stanger could taunt him with the knowledge that his feelings aren’t returned as he fucks Kevin. Feel free to be as vague or explicit with the sex as you like; I’m just really interested in the power dynamics at play with this situation.

Another thing I'd be super down to read is Kevin, as a high school student, having a loveless and angst-ridden fling with Stanger once Stanger arrives at Riverdale High. Maybe he has a legitimate attraction (which Stanger doesn't return outside of the physical) or he just needs a rebound from a terrible relationship. Stanger can either be the villain he was in the comics, or just the cold hardass principal. Maybe he and Kevin get stuck in a lot of meetings together due to Kevin's involvement in student government and other extracurriculars, and they end up beginning an affair. I'd love to see Kevin angsting over the knowledge that they can't be caught in a relationship together and knowing that they don't love each other, but desperately wanting to be with someone. He knows he's in a illicit relationship devoid of legitimate affection, and keeping it a secret is making him paranoid, but at the same time, he can't seem walk away from it. Just all the angst and indecision and internal conflict.

Or if you want to go in a humor/crack direction, I'd love to see Kevin falling for Stanger for some super geeky reason (\"His speech at the track banquet was so well-paced! He complimented my planning skills at the student government meeting last week!) and blatantly hitting on him, much to the exasperation/disbelief of his friends and the discomfort of the teaching staff. (I love all of the Riverdale faculty, and I would love to see them dealing with this awkward situation.) Stanger can either be oblivious because he's too busy with his megalomaniacal plotting, or annoyed and impatient because Kevin's obvious attempts to seduce him are a constant distraction from his megalomaniacal plotting.

Duke’s death, Falcon currently using drugs

I know Duke basically died in the movie, but I’d really prefer to ignore that. Actually, if you like it, feel free to ignore the movie entirely. I’d love to see a different take on Falcon’s origins. I know it’s canon that Falcon often screws up and goofs off, but I’d really prefer any fic about him to portray him as a talented agent and someone who takes his job seriously and does it well.

I’m a hurt/comfort junkie, so feel free to use any hurt/comfort tropes you like for Falcon, as long as he’s able to recover from his injuries.

If you’d like to go in a humor/crack direction, I really love the idea of Duke being an overprotective older brother, sort of like Thor and Loki in this MCU fic, and Falcon tolerating it but also sometimes becoming exasperated with Duke’s antics.

Similarly, maybe you would like to a fic about five times one of the Joes found Falcon hot but was too intimidated by Duke to make a move, and the one time a Joe got the nerve to ask Falcon out?

If you want to do a type of origin story for Falcon in lieu of the movie events, I think it would be cool if Falcon joined the Joes to prove himself to Duke, but to prevent Duke from interfering, completed his initial training to be accepted into the Joes with Sergeant Slaughter and the Renegades rather than with Beach Head.

I really like the idea of Falcon being Duke’s unofficial and silent support assistant within the Joes, who goes the extra mile to ensure things run smoothly. I would love a fic where a visiting general comes along and the Joes need his approval to secure new funds or to continue operating, and the guy propositions Falcon, who agrees as long as the Joes get what they need in return. Falcon feels guilty and ashamed, but he is also convinced he did the right thing to help the Joes. Maybe [character of your choice] finds out and then comforts him afterward?

If you’d like to use an angsty backstory for Falcon, I thought of this idea where he gets into drugs at 17/18 years old and becomes involved with the Headman or some other neerdowell, and, unbeknownst to his family, prostitutes himself for drugs or drug money. The Headman can either be his pimp or just his dealer. Perhaps one of the Joes finds Falcon, helps him straighten out, and then brings him into the team. How do these events effective Falcon in forming other romantic relationships?

I’d also be really eager for a fic with Falcon showing off his skills and proving his competence and gaining admiration from the other Joes.

 If you’d like to write a mission fic, I would love to see Falcon and any one of the Joes to go undercover as a couple. Whether it’s for laughs or actually leads to the two of them getting together is up to you.

If you wanted to write a plot based on an episode, I’d be fine with anything, but I think it would be really cool if one of the Joes fully realizing his or her feelings for Falcon in a “There’s No Place Like Springfield”-type of scenario.

**To expand on my thoughts about bi erasure, I would prefer that if you are writing a same-sex pairing where one or both of the characters was presented with heterosexual inclinations in canon (ie, interest in the opposite sex, opposite sex love interest, etc.) that they be presented in the fic as bisexual rather than gay.

Dark Is Rising Sequence - Susan Cooper

Fate/Grand Order 
Merlin (Fate/Grand Order)

DNW: infidelity, character death, rape/non-con, crackfic, humiliation/embarrassment

I'm most interested in reading about him during pre-canon or Arthurian-era. I'm not very interested in him interacting with original F/GO characters such as, say, the protagonist. However, if you'd like to write him meeting people related to his myth in Chaldea (such as, say, proto!Arthur or any of the Knights of the Round Table or Saberfaces or whatnot) that would be amazing! 

His lines about how he loves humanity as a whole, but not individual humans is something I find really interesting to explore! 

Prompts: 
- something about his A rank in Illusion
- exploring him being the \"Magus of Flowers\"
- possible interesting interactions: Saber Alter, Berserker Lancelot, proto!Arthur, proto!Merlin (even if she's not in the game yet)
- him observing the events of the world: could bring other Fate/Nasuverse things into here? 
- Or just anything about him being a watcher/observer, and how he very rarely goes and interferes himself, and I mean, in the past this involved Arturia, so maybe something about how he feels about working in Chaldea now?
- anything from his mentorship of Arturia. Cute or angsty, your call!

Love Live! Sunshine!! 
Watanabe You (Sunshine), Sakurauchi Riko (Sunshine)

DNW: infidelity, character death, rape/non-con, crackfic, humiliation/embarrassment

I think there are so many intriguing things about their dynamic. You feels left out of Chika and Riko's closeness, but Riko herself is so sweet to You and surprisingly understanding? I like reading their relationship as You also feeling strange because Riko is so obviously beautiful, talented, kind, etc. so of course everyone's drawn to her. But I also think Riko admires You, and how she can so easily be herself, when Riko has self-esteem issues. They have a more understated relationship, IMO, but I really think they'd be great at reading each other without needing to talk about it. They both have taken on roles as the “straight man” to the more out-there antics of Aqours, so I think they'd be very supportive of each other.

Prompts: 
- them creating things for each other
- You discovers Riko's yuri stash
- please explain their paired Wonderland UR set in SIF to me because it's amazing

Tsukihime 
Tohno Akiha, Kohaku (Tsukihime)

DNW: infidelity, character death, rape/non-con, crackfic, humiliation/embarrassment

I would really like post-canon fic. For the Near Side routes, Kohaku's (and by extension, Akiha's) fate is an unanswered burning question I have about the VN. SHIKI is gone, what now? I'm also interested in the answer for this in a post-Akiha's True End perspective, especially considering what happened to Shiki (please disregard the Kagetsu Tohya sidestory in this scenario). Post-Kohaku's True End, they have reached some understanding with each other, but there are years of things left unspoken between these two that they need to talk about; I would love to read this conversation. 

There are more details in my letter!

The Astronaut Wives Club (TV) 
Louise Shepard (Astronaut Wives Club), Alan B. Shepard Jr. (Astronaut Wives Club), Alice Shepard (Astronaut Wives Club)

Prompts:

Louise and Alan
I do actually love them together. They are so so flawed and their relationship is so so messy and at times toxic and awful! But they stick it out and she dies of heartbreak just weeks after him and I am interested in how they get there.
-Their sojourn with the hippies (episode 9 “The Dark Side”) was hilarious and plenty more could come of it.
-How does Louise deal with Alan's return to space/landing on the moon?
-Does Louise have regrets wrt Max? Does Louise ever tell Alan about Max or anything that happened with Max? Note: I’m fine with bashing Alan’s terrible behavior but please don’t bash Louise for her choices or Alan &amp; Louise in general. 

&nbsp;

Alice Shepard
WHAT. Okay so her parents died when she was five and she went to live with her Aunt Louise. . .who changed her name from Judy to Alice because Judy was too much like Julie, Louise &amp; Alan's daughter who was the same age and OMG WHAT. Teen Alice is a brat because why wouldn't she be, look at her family, and Louise decides to bring her to her mother's grave to connect and I cried (episode 8 “Abort”). There are so many possibilities for fic here.
-Little Alice's identity problems.
-A romance between Teen Alice and Ed White Jr.
-Alice growing up determined to be everything Louise isn't but actually being a lot like her in surprising ways.
-Alice becomes an astronaut. Or an astronaut's wife.
-Alice names her own daughter Judy Louise.
-Alice tries to seduce Alan but fails because gross and then he explains why Louise is the way she is and why he loves her so much.
-Alice and Julie resent each other for reasons but also have each other’s back because sisters. -The obvious/amazing Wonderland AU (Louise as Queen of Hearts!!!).

I am just really seriously utterly fascinated by Alice Shepard.

Crossover with Mad Men
Louise Shepard and Betty Draper and Don Draper and Alan Shepard dinner party and/or weekend getaway. It writes itself. Trudy Cooper flies Megan somewhere for some actress thing and they bond (and make out). Marge and Joan. Peggy and Rene. Alice and Sally. I don't care if the timeline works, I just want them all to be friends (and make out).

Hallo Yuletider!

Thanks for fic-writin' for me! You're a star. My general likes and DNWs are in my Dear Author letter, but here's a quick rundown of my specific preferences for this fandom, which certainly aren't binding, etc, etc. Write what pleases you, and verily, it shall please me also.

PERSUASION. Okay, so, we see a lot of Anne's point of view canonically and also in fandom, but I really, reaaaaallllllly want some pining from Wentworth. this [https://magpiemountains.tumblr.com/post/166132495110/brambleberrycottage-crimsonclad-the-thing] genuinely excellent commentary on Wentworth's feelings made me reassess my general apathy towards him? really, that tumblr post is key to why I decided to request Persuasion. I would very much like some insight into the Feelings behind that stoic exterior, because, yes, my drug is Feelings. Allllll the Feelings. (and frankly, Anne needs to be appreciated and pined for more, because she is A Precious.)

But yes. Feelings. Pining. Mutually requited, eventually resolved pining! But pining. If that's your jam.

Hallo Yuletider!

Thanks for fic-writin' for me! You're a star. My general likes and DNWs are in my Dear Author letter, but here's a quick rundown of my specific preferences for this fandom, which certainly aren't binding, etc, etc. Write what pleases you, and verily, it shall please me also.

IMPERIAL RADCH. Okay, so, Seivarden is a Hot Mess and I love her. I love her awful, wonderful personality and in particular I love her complex relationship with Breq. I would Very Much Like to know what it would take to get those two into some kind of romantic... thing, even with all their issues, and what it would look like. Because they definitely have a lot of relationship-barrier issues (Breq's identification with non-humanness, her stoic ancillary... sorta-asexuality, sorta-refusal-to-attach?, Seivarden's addictions and depression and arrogance and out-of-timeness and pride). But when I was reading the Ancillary trilogy, I frankly wanted them to be in some kind of romantic thing with Feelings eventually, because Seivarden's devotion gives /me/ feelings. And also Seivarden's feelings in general give me feelings? It's a complicated thing, devotion in this kind of character- it runs counter to how she's been raised, and it's such a learning thing for her, and she's pretty smashed up on the inside, and it's hard. but you may not agree with this ship! and that is totally okay! I am fine with whatever exploration of their relationship you are happy to write, romantic or otherwise. I just have a lot of feels about both Seivarden and their dynamic.

Brave (2012)

Hallo Yuletider!

Thanks for fic-writin' for me! You're a star. My general likes and DNWs are in my Dear Author letter, but here's a quick rundown of my specific preferences for this fandom, which certainly aren't binding, etc, etc. Write what pleases you, and verily, it shall please me also.

BRAVE. Okay. I enjoy Merida's forthright, adventurous, good-humoured personality, and her rambunctious but affectionate relationship with her family, and her- wonder and curiosity at the world, really. What I've been wanting to know for a while now is who she'd end up marrying and why she'd marry them (see: Unashamed Sap Loves Having Feelings). It doesn't have to be one of the three clansmen suggested (preferably not, actually, but write what you please). Really, I'd love to know what kind of person she'd actually have feelings for- are they even Scottish? Do her parents like them? Does she end up marrying for love or for diplomacy (and can it please be both)? Alternatively, if you're not into that, I wouldn't mind knowing what she's like as an adult, particularly when it comes to her history with the eldritch and whatever political happenings were occurring in the handwavey-fantasy-historical time period Brave is set in (is this pre-British annexation? very likely). I love worldbuilding, so any of that wider fantasy-political funtimes is great. 

Also! I am, as noted in my letter, a Very Big Fan of both modern AUs and the wide-ranging fields of AU alternatives (soulmates! daemons! genderswap! A/B/O!), so if you like those, go for gold with all my excited squealing behind you. (As an extra sidenote, on the romance front I'm an m/f shipper in this particular fandom, but write what works for you.)

Juniper Game - Sherryl Jordan 
Juniper Golding

(My only hard DNW is Juniper/Niall shipping, but I am here for Juniper rocking up to Niall's caravan for some life advice, if you super want to include him)
The Juniper Game: I adored this book as a kid, and I was delighted to see it nominated this year. I know it’s a weird thing to say, maybe, but trying to think back to what I loved most about the book was ‘colours’ – the stained glass windows, Dylan’s paints, the house (‘like living in a tree’, I loved that house So Much), the gypsy caravan (yup, I wince about it as an adult, but still…). Basically I’m apparently a romantic sap, just not about people.

I was a bit thrown by the characters nominated (Juniper/Niall was my first worry and... well, YKINMKATO, but it’s really not for me). I’d like something that leaned towards Juniper herself, especially post-book and her as an independent young adult. What’s she up to now? The Best Medieval historian ever? :D Does she still have powers? Is she in ‘contact’ with Dylan still?

The Lions of Al-Rassan: Oh my god, I saw this book nominated and have picked it back up so I can remember the exact details so I don’t put my request foot in it somehow, and this book is so glorious. I feel the need to point out up front that holy cow I don’t expect you to write like Guy Gavriel Kay, because hot damn he’s too good and wow is that some impressively deep politics and world building he’s got going there.

What draws me in particularly about this book is the characters – I adore everyone on this character list and their relationships with each other, and choosing – even now – is so hard! Everyone is so freaking competent and elegant and chivalrous – which is a word I hate usually but it damn well fits here. I’m also wildly into the trope of respecting and admiring one’s opponents. I'm here for Ammar/Rodrigo Rodrigo/Jehane, Ammar/Jehane, all three of them *definitely* (I'd really prefer Miranda giving explicit or implicit permission to Rodrigo at some point) , in any combo of gen hanging out, all the way up to as explicit sex as you want.

Seeing each other from across the room and giving each other the “yes, <i>hi</i>, I <i>like</i> the look of you…” mutual insta-attraction that only happens in books. Or in this case, exactly what she’s singing about. Doubly good when that attraction holds through the first conversation, the driving off for the weekend to… (I’m partial to a beach side shack, or a cottage in the forest, but hey, if your dream weekend is flashy casinos and fancy 5-star hotels, take me there. The glee shines through regardless, and I’m here for that glee). I was juuust a touch too young (and probably not right country, really) for arcade malls as a Thing, but if that’s your happy place, absolutely write up a storm there, too. I'm very here for physical attraction a) being consumated, and b) deepening into actual connection as they get to know each other. I'm okay if that weekend was their only weekend for some reason, but I basically want a happy ending/fond recollections, if for some reason you don't see them having a Happily Ever After/long term relationship for whatever reason.

This feels like a ridiculous little thing to ping off, but, well, it is Yuletide. So The Man in Black and Inigo Montoya, from the climb up the cliff to the “please understand I hold you in the highest respect”, I am slashing the absolute hell out of them. (See above for opponents respecting each other’s skills) To my eye, they’re flirting wildly the whole scene, so 1001 words of continued flirting somehow (MIB cannot quite bear to leave him unconscious?), through to 1001 words of PWP, I’m wildly here for it. Or, hell, an epic rewriting of the movie with them together, go for it! This, honestly, is a fanciful late addition because I suspect I’m otherwise going to be a bastard to match, but it's also a fondly carried delight.

Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator 
Lucien Bloodmarch

I really like the kids of Dream Daddy, but Lucien's my particular favourite. You could basically write anything with Lucien and I'd be happy. Feel free to include any of the other kids if you'd like, but of course there's no obligation to do so. Some canon prompts if you want them: Lucien and Ernest hanging out for whatever reason (their dads are dating, one is tutoring the other?), or Lucien babysitting for one or more of the younger kids (possibly with help from an older kid) or Lucien bonding with his dad.

General things I like: family things, especially found family. Family bonding is also good. Gen things, though shipping is great too. I love AUs so even if the specific prompt doesn't mention them, AUs are always an option. I am a sucker for hurt/comfort as long as there's plenty of comfort. 

Things I do not like: Characters dying or getting permanently injured, A/B/O or mpreg.

Stardew Valley (Video Game) 
Sebastian (Stardew Valley), Maru (Stardew Valley)

I would love more fic exploring Sebastian and Maru's clearly strained relationship. Backstory would be cool – how long has Sebastian been living there? The age difference doesn't look very large, so Robin and Demetrius must have had Maru not long after Robin split up with Sebastian's dad. Did Sebastian live with his dad until recently? I have so many questions, and canon has only given me vague references to things.

The Dalemark Quartet - Diana Wynne Jones 
Moril (Dalemark Quartet)

Moril is one of my favourite characters ever so I requested only him, though you're free to throw in anyone else. I'd love fic from anywhere in the timeline – precanon, or between books 1 and 4, or post book 4. Or if you want to write him as Undying and write The Adventures of Mitt and Moril as they wander Dalemark and wait for Maewen to rejoin them, I would be super okay with that too. Or AUs, I am always down for AUs.

Inda series - Sherwood Smith 
Savarend \"Fox\" Montredavan-An

Fox is one of my favourite characters and I would pretty much take anything revolving around him. If sticking with canon, I really loved his relationship with Barend, and to a lesser extent his relationship with Inda, so anything around them would be neat, or anything with his sister. A couple canon prompts if you want them: Fox &amp; Barend on Walic's ship, plotting about or with Inda. Post-Walic, Fox trying to come to terms with how things went. Post-Wafri, Fox and Inda talking about what happened.

You don't have to include all four characters. I love the friendship between these four so, so much. But I also totally ship them, so again, whatever way you want to go with them is fine. Briar's my favourite if that makes a difference, but I love all of them. Possible prompts: navigating the switch from friends/foster sibs to datemates/poly group, or sickfic/whump where one of them gets ill or injured and the others take care of them, or general fluff where they're all getting along.

Nikki & Nora 
Nora Delaney, Nikki Beaumont

I love these two so much! I have an overwhelming love for detective/mystery shows so a show with two queer ladies that could explore all of my favorite detective show tropes was a delight. I love their banter, their love and support of each other, the way their personalities compliment and maybe sometimes clash a bit. 

If you want them on a case, hitting any of the familiar cop show beats would be amazing — undercover together, one partner hurt or in danger and the other worrying, rescuing, being protective, or comforting, just them being badass together, etc. 

I also love personal moments with these two if you don’t want to go the case route! Go old school with them first realizing/exploring their feelings or maybe give us a glimpse into their present or future. There’s a lot of history hinted at between the events of the pilot and the web series, if any of that interests you, explore it!

One Day at a Time (TV 2017) 
Penelope Alvarez, Jill Riley

These two have such great chemistry and are so fun together! I think they’d make a fantastic romantic pairing but I’m also happy with friendship fic if you don’t see the romantic potential as I do! 

We haven’t seen Jill mix in with a lot of the regular characters in Penelope’s life so I think something that throws her in more contact with either Penelope’s family and/or work colleagues could be a lot of fun. 

If you’re going the femslashy route, fake dating with eventual real feelings would be amazing! I love the entire family, so playing with their reactions would be amazing. I also think just throwing Jill into the mix at a family dinner could be a lot of fun and that work work for either femslash or gen! Or, send Jill to Penelope’s office for something and see what kind of shenanigans happen there.

These kids! They’re so in love with each other and so bad at communicating it or accepting it! Where we are in cannon as I type this, Mariah has definitely realized her feelings. Has Tessa already admitted to herself that she has feelings for Mariah. When did that or will that happen? 

I’d love some angsty feelings of unrequited pining for them both which ends in a revelation or confession! Or, embrace a fun trope like fake dating to make someone jealous…  I am a long time lover of soap operas so really any favorite soap opera trope you want to throw at these two, I would love. 

Or, pick anything from my list of favorite things up at the start of my letter and apply it to them! 

I also really like Mariah’s relationship with Sharon so if you wanted to have her confiding in Sharon about her feelings for Tessa or anything else, that would be fabulous!

Wentworth (TV) 
Franky Doyle, Bridget Westfall

I love these two so much separately and together! I adore that Franky is tough and smart as hell and will do anything to survive. Bridget, oh how I adore her ponytails and fab glasses and her swagger. I dig how feisty and a little bit dork she is and how committed she is to helping the women even as she’s having to navigate the chaos that is the leadership at the prison.

I enjoyed the angst of the show putting them in prisoner/prison staff territory again this season after they’d already started a relationship. I love that we saw a different side of Bridget especially as she was unable to maintain the boundaries she’d clung to in earlier seasons. 

I’d love anything from the time in between season 3 and 4 when they were figuring out their relationship doing the happily (or maybe not always) couple thing. I loved Franky &amp; Bea's relationship too so Bridget comforting Franky in the aftermath of Bea's death would be welcome. I would also love some angst while Franky is on the run after season 4 and/or a reunion after.

Sure, Ohta immediately asks Tanaka to rephrase that, but that doesn’t mean that Tanaka’s wrong about the nature of their friendship. What immediately drew me to these two was the fact that they don’t seem to have known each other very long! How did they wind up falling into this friendship? Was Ohta a born rescuer?

I’d love something for just the two of them interacting. I don’t care if it’s a forced scenario, like getting locked in the student council room overnight, or if it’s something more natural, like the two of them being the only free ones one day. It’s fine if this is cute gen – if you’re caught up with the manga, there’s a recent bit where tired-from-cram-school Kaname keeps falling asleep in Yuuki and Yuuta’s apartment and anything along those lines would be adorable – or if you go for the pairing route. I really do think these two complement each other well, even if Kaname is annoyed by Yuuki at least 98% of the time. Yuuki mellows Kaname out, and Kaname forces Yuuki to have some motivation. And of course all their arguing is pretty hot.

I should preface this by saying I haven’t played the games, but if you’re familiar with the games and want to do some anime/game blend thing, feel free. I fell pretty hard for these two from the first episode. It’s pretty bulletproof for me when one character says they get along with everyone EXCEPT THIS ONE OTHER CHARACTER, but by the end of the series they’re fighting together and exchanging high-fives. I love Kane-san and Mutsunokami working together, and I’d love to see more of them giving each other grief and supporting each other. And if that requires a lot of fighting and kissing, well, I'm here for that, too.

Psychic Force 
Burn Griffith, Wendy Ryan, Keith Evans, Patty Myers

Prompts: I hate to say this, but...anything? It's a fairly shallow series, so anything that adds some depth is great. I'd love something going into how normal people and psychics relate, as it's something incredibly important to the story, but not used at all. Are there psychic sympathizers? More peaceful liberation groups? Previous attempts at revolution? One of Burn's biggest weaknesses is that his entire plan is \"let's forget about all this nonsense and go home\" without really addressing why NOA exists or is so extreme. I don't think he's bad, just kind of naive. Is there any way for him to break out of that and for Keith to break out of terrorism? (read: is it at all possible to get my OTP together without suffering?) Pretty much anything with Burn and Keith and their tumultuous relationship is good.

I just like Patty in general. What was her childhood like? How long has she been on her own? How did she meet up with Might, and how did they become friends instead of fighting? What happens to her after the game? Can the time loop break? 

I like Wendy a lot too, both as the spunky kid character in 2010 or the older, sadder kid in 2012. She's been through a lot and she still gets one of the happiest endings for a good character - and that's still losing two of the three people she cares about. What does she do after 2012? Is there any conflict with Burn about how she killed Keith? What was her childhood like with Chris? How did she join NOA? What was she up to inbetween 2010 and 2012? 

I know Patty and Wendy never interact in game, but I'd kind of like to see them meet in fic. I think they'd have a much less chance of killing each other on sight than most of the rest of the cast, and both of them deserve to hang out with a friend for a little bit :) 

Burn/Keith is encouraged, Patty/Wendy could be fun, I think Wendy has a one-sided crush/longing for Burn (or just the stability he represents) but I can't see him reciprocating.

Ted (Suikoden), Gremio (Suikoden), Tir McDohl (Suikoden I)

Prompts: I like worldbuilding, and Suikoden is a great place for that. I dig the setting, and I'd love a deeper look into the Chinese-European fantasy mix that makes it up. I'd love to see how it's changed over the centuries, both in the past and how it will change in the future. How are the wars and heroes remembered later? How do they remember themselves? More about how magic and runes work would also be great. Just how influential are the True Runes?

For something a bit more character-focused, what does it mean if Gremio comes back out of the Soul Eater? What happens when he dies a second time? The idea of him picking up a True Rune so Tir won't be alone again is interesting, but would that have any consequences after his resurrection? (Soul Eater not wanting to give up its snack, maybe)  

Or Tir wandering around centuries later. How does he adjust to the changes in the world? I think it would be interesting to see him interact with or become a historian. How does the party line differ from what he remembers, and is what he remembers even still accurate? Human memory is such a fragile thing... 

My prompts for Ted are similar to Tir, but in reverse. He's also surprisingly immature and bad at hiding his true nature, which is weird considering he's supposed to have been doing this for the past three or four hundred years. (I mean, yeah, the reason is exposition. But still.) Who does he have in Soul Eater? How did the rune continue influencing his life?

Gremio/Tir and Ted/Tir are both fine, if you want to go that route. Or not. Whichever.

Giant Robo (1992-1998) 

Prompts: Go for broke! 

No seriously I love this thing so fucking much just more of the OVA is great, more focus on anything the OVA skipped over (like 90% of the cast) is great, more worldbuilding is especially great. I rolled Any because I really would be happy to receive a fic about anyone nominated, or any of their relationships, or anything. Giant Robo is a show that gives you just glimpses into the world and characters, just enough to whet your taste for more. So just a little more for anyone would be great! I'm deliberately keeping the prompts broad, so just pick whoever you like and go for it.

Post canon cleaning up and rebuilding? Pre-canon adventures? Quiet moments of downtime? Places where something could've gone differently? How anyone joined IPO/Big Fire? Has anyone ever met someone from the other side at a time and place where they couldn't just fight it out then and there? How awkward was it? What's it like growing up in the IPO/Big Fire? I imagine Daisaku and Sunny would have very different perceptions on it, not to mention Taisou, Tetsugyu, and Ginrei!

For more general worldbuilding ideas, GR was one of my requests for worldbuilding_exchange and the letter is <a href=\"https://marsdragon.dreamwidth.org/1412.html#cutid3\">here</a>

Ar tonelico 
Infel

Prompts: I just really want to know more about Infel. She was stuck in Infel Pira for four hundred years. What was that like? What did she feel, watching the Maidens all those years? Did it help advance her research - and speaking of, I'd love to see more of that. The weird science/magic of Ar tonelico is fascinating to me, and Infel is a great person to dig into it with. Shes also a fascinating character in her own right, filled with both hope and despair, both the savior of so many and the one who wanted to destroy the world...something about her feelings at a critical point would be interesting. 

I'd like to see more of her relationships in life too. Her relationship with Grammel is interesting, even though we only see a summary of it. How did she end up getting adopted? They split apart with a lot of pain on both sides, so a look into that would also be interesting - or the moment Infel realises what Mimimi was supposed to be. Did they ever meet again after that? 

And the big one, her relationship with Nenesha. I'd like to see the relationship that inspired Infel to declare war against the goddess, live as a program for 400 years, and try to pull of sublimation. I ship them, but if you want to write it like a very (very!) deep friendship that's fine too. You can go super sweet and cute here, or something much darker, considering how the relationship turned out.

Final Fantasy V 

Prompts: More worldbuilding yes. I know what I like. Jobs and crystals! The party sorting over who gets to be what job? What jobs do the characters like, and are they ever forced to pick up ones they don't? Or maybe there's a job they unexpectedly enjoy? There are spirits in the crystals, do they communicate with the heroes? Do the heroes pass on to the crystals later? Use whoever you like for these prompts, I'd be happy to see them with anyone. 

Or more about the world after its been merged! The entire world's been upheaved, what sort of political situation have Krile and Lenna had dropped into their laps? Does it help to have an adventurer and a pirate around or does that just make it worse? Can Faris and her crew keep up their pirating, or does she want to stop now her best friend and sister is running a country? (and how does the crew feel about that?)

Or little character moments, I'd love to see more between Faris and Syldra, especially as children. Or Lenna and Syldra, if Summoners can talk to their summoned beasts. How does Lenna feel about Syldra and Faris having grown up together when she was separated from her sister so young? Or any small moment - talking around the campfire, a near miss in battle, trying to buy new equipment for everyone while on a budget. 

I'd love to see Gilgamesh get to interact more with the party, maybe after escaping from the Void and having adventures across the rest of the FF universe. The battle with Necrophobe feels like Gilgamesh sees himself as more of a friend to the party than the party sees him as a friend...which could lead to a bunch of awkwardness either way.

悪魔城ドラキュラ Castlevania | Castlevania: Lament of Innocence 
Walter Bernhard (Lament of Innocence), Mathias Cronqvist (Lament of Innocence), Leon Belmont (Lament of Innocence)

Fandom specific request: Mathias is Dracula, I don't want anything saying/implying he isn't. 

Prompts: If you want to write a bunch of porn, this is the fandom. I'm fine with smut for all of these characters and you can feel free to go dark and bloody with it. Any pairing between these three or all together, it's fine. Though I really can't see Leon/Mathias having a nice, happy relationship pre-canon because let's face it, Mathias' biggest problem is that he can only love one person at a time. But fucked up post-canon vampires I am all for. 

I dig bad ends, and there are so many ways for LoI to end badly besides the canon one. Feel free to pull out some canon-divergence AUs here, and if you can think of a way for things to end happily, well...I'd love to see that. (it's hard) Playing around a bit with Leon getting captured might also be interesting, though I can't see him role-reversing with Mathias so easily. 

I'd love to see more of how Mathias manipulated Walter into doing what he wanted, probably with Walter trying to play him too (and failing...but maybe getting a few points in?). Technically I already got a fic like this but hell, I always want more. How much did they know of each other before Mathias kicked off the plan? How much did Walter actually know, and how much did he just think he knew?

If you want to write something happier, adventures before canon starts would be fun. It would be nice to see Leon and Mathias actually acting like friends for once...and if you want to play up the inevitable tragedy, go for it.

The Defenders (Marvel TV) 
Jessica Jones (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Matt Murdock (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Trish Walker (The Defenders (Marvel TV))

I loved Matt and Jessica's brief but hilarious interactions in the third episode and would love to see more in the same vein -- does Matt become Jessica's regular lawyer?  Does Jessica run into him on the street and kick his cane?  Does she start frequenting Josie's after her regular dive is closed due to health code violations?  Or a brawl she started?

Also, this is sort of cheating because he's not on the list of tags, but Foggy Nelson is my forever girl, and I'd really love anything that explores his interactions with Jessica.  Bonus points if being her official firm minder is the worst part (read: best, he's a sucker) of his current job.  Bonus bonus points if Jessica asks about his husband in front of his colleagues so often that they actually think he and Matt are married.

If the Daredevil boys really aren't your thing, I'd also love any gen about Jessica's relationship with Trish.  

(Bonus points for Malcolm's appearances in any of the above!)

Please no polyamory.

My So-Called Life 
Brian Krakow, Angela Chase, Enrique \"Rickie\" Vasquez, Mr. Katimsky (My So-Called Life)

This is my forever ship, and I'd love a get-together fic of any variety.  Does Angela actually fall for Brian later in 10th grade?  Does Brian step up to help around the house and drive Angela places (she fails her driving test obviously) when Graham moves out and Patty has a meltdown?  Does Angela clumsily seduce him the summer before college because she doesn't want to start freshman year a virgin?  Do they lose touch and then later in life move to the same city (I vote Philadelphia!) and run into each other there as adults?  What does Angela think when Brian finally cuts his hair?  (Google pictures of Devon Gummersall now.  You're welcome.). I'll take them any way I can get them.

If you do not ship Brian and Angela, you should first of all know that I am judging you, but I'd also love to see anything where Mr. Katimsky and his partner adopt Ricky.

Young Wizards - Diane Duane 

Again this is sort of a cheat, because the characters I'm interested in aren't tags.  I've seen a few awesome Carl/Tom stories where they get together romantically shortly after meeting and becoming errantry partners, but I'd love one where they've worked together for many years before falling in love (or realizing they did long ago).  Bonus points if one or both struggle with coming to terms with their sexuality -- remember that unless you're going by the new millennium timeline, Carl and Tom probably met some time in the sixties.

Pitch (TV 2016) 
Al Luongo, Ginny Baker, Livan Duarte, Mike Lawson

I was crushed by this show being cancelled before its time, and what I long for most is more of it. Tell me stories about Sunday dinners at Al's (tell me about Al resuming Sunday dinners as a lonely widower, now that his wife is gone, but his team are his family, too). Tell me about Livan and his complicated relationship with baseball, with Cuba, with his family and Isabella. Tell me about Ginny's career milestones as she works her way through the majors, about Mike's retirement tour with the Padres. 

If you're into it, I also ship Bawson really hard, and would pretty much be delighted with anything. I love stories that show their work with emotional development, especially when shippy, and would love to see that work here. I'd love future fic, seeing what it looks like for them as Ginny becomes a veteran, as Mike gets into Cooperstown, as they both learn what their post-baseball lives might be like (a hang-up they both have that they allude to but never talk to each other about). 

I love this show with all my heart, and I love baseball with all my heart, and I'd love to see more of both here.


Request 2 by maybetwice
Hart of Dixie 
Lavon Hayes, Zoe Hart, Wade Kinsella, Lemon Breeland

One of my favorite things about the show is that Bluebell itself is a character, a force of its own (like when Lavon tells George that \"the town is weird\" at the end of season 1). I would love love love some exploration of Bluebell's weirdness/magic, with a fantastical element to the town that makes things happen in certain way in Bluebell, and how this factors into the lives of all the characters.

I love Zoe's friendship with Lavon and Lemon's grudging-then-close friendship with Wade, and would love anything exploring those friendly dynamics, especially as they pertain to their interconnected romantic relationships (and the tension that comes out of that!). I'm not really into turning the friend dynamics between Zoe and Lavon, or Lemon and Wade, into something romantic unless it's shenanigans (having to fool somebody into thinking they're dating, when they're REALLY dating the other person and have to hide it). but, in fact, the more shenanigans, the better. &lt;3

And, if you want to COMPLETELY CHANGE MY LIFE, I have a burning desire for a sedoretu arrangement with these four characters, with Zoe and Lavon being the Morning couple and Wade and Lemon as the Evening. I realize this is probably an absurd prompt, but there you have it!

This fandom is one of my favorite Yuletide fandoms that I return to every few years, and so anything that explores the broadness of the canon universe, its social and political norms, and how the events of the books shape those norms will be deeply interesting to me. But here are a couple of prompts if you prefer to have solid ideas to work from!

- Will's life after the series. We read lots about Lyra's world and her life after--how does Will learn to live his life to become the kind of person he's meant to? How does living with his daemon affect his life in a world without them?
- I'd love to see any kind of political expansion of Pullman's world--how do witches and bears interact with the nations of the world, and how do they maintain autonomy and their cultures in a (we can guess!) growing and imperialistic world?

The Dreyfus Affair - Peter Lefcourt 
Randy Dreyfus, D. J. Pickett

I just adore Randy and D.J. and I’d love a story about them doing absolutely anything and being delighted with each other. I’d love to read the more explicit version of their first time in the weight room, or a more explicit version of them having sex at any time. Normally I would say that epithets in sex scenes are to be used with extreme reticence, if at all, but here it’s canon, so I absolutely want to read about the blond shortstop and his second baseman getting it on.

I also really love stories that incorporate media or are pastiches of pieces of media and this fandom is perfect for one! I’d love to read a Sports Illustrated retrospective piece on Randy and D.J., or an interview in the Advocate about how middle infielders making out in Neiman Marcus changed everything, or a transcript of the episode of Pretty Good by Jon Bois where he breaks down exactly what went down in the Reds-Valley Vikings World Series for a new generation, or anything along those lines, if you’re into that sort of thing.

I’m fine with canon-typical homophobia, racism, etc. playing a role in a story where it would come up. I love baseball and any amount of baseball stuff would thrill me--no such thing as too much or too little.

National Football League RPF 
Alex Smith (National Football League RPF), Travis Kelce (National Football League RPF)

I actually got sucked into watching football because of Yuletide and Alex Smith. He’s such a fascinating, thoughtful, smart guy who’s easy to root for and fun to watch, especially this year when (at least through four games at the time I’m writing this) he’s been playing like an MVP candidate and people are being forced to take notice and I love it.

Travis Kelce is pretty much the exact opposite of Alex in so many ways but somehow managed to charm me in spite of myself. He’ll do things that are SO childish yet SO satisfying, like the time he threw his towel at a referee. I love how he plays up the dumb jock thing because he’ll also talk about how cool it is that Alex knows so much stuff and how he can ask him anything because Alex always has an interesting response. I can't even hate him for being a Cleveland sports fan!

I’d love get-together fic or established relationship fic, but I’d be just as delighted by gen about football stuff -- if you can even call it 'gen,' the way they’re always talking about ‘chemistry,’ and ‘hooking up’ and the like — or gen about downtime stuff, especially turning mundane activities into a competition, or talking about TV shows that various team members are watching (often because Alex has recommended them). I’d also really love Alex Smith gangbang fic, the kind where his teammates get together to show him how much they appreciate him. Or gen fic about how his teammates get together to show him how much they appreciate him is great too!

The Professor - Charlotte Brontë 
William Crimsworth, Hunsden Yorke Hunsden, Frances Evans Henri

I am fascinated the role that Hunsden Yorke Hunsden plays in this story, which is one of the things that makes it different from Vilette, which is essentially a later draft. From the beginning he alternates between needling William and performing these extremely thoughtful favors for him, although it's not always easy for him to get under William's skin since William perversely enjoys some of his bluntness. He brings out such an interesting side of Frances when he meets her, too -- I love that promptly she gets into three arguments with him in a row, and the third time she doesn't even believe in the argument she's making; she just wants to fight with him!

I'm particularly interested in a story set when William and Frances are living in England and Hunsden is their neighbor. I love how he has apparently latched onto their family in lieu of starting their own, especially the way he seems to practically be a coparent to Victor when he’s at home. I would love more about their daily life as it's sketched all too briefly in that last chapter, or a story about something that happens as Victor gets older and goes to school, which William worries about.

I would also love threesome fic! William would be almost hopelessly scandalized by the prospect, I think, and surely Frances too, but then with the dynamic both she and Hunsden have with William where they love to tease him I can imagine it working out somehow. I do love stories where characters fumble their way into unusual relationships or sexual practices without quite knowing what they're doing or having the usual vocabulary to talk about it, which is sort of what I would picture. But I would be just as happy with a story that explores the dynamic among them that wasn’t threesome fic.

Heather Davis, Valencia Perez

I love Heather’s snark and how she really cares about her friends despite her eyerolling exterior, and I love Valencia’s character development over the first 2 seasons and hope to see her come into her own. What do they do together when they’re not enmeshed in the middle of Rebecca’s drama? I'd adore a getting-together story, but a work putting their friendship central would make me happy too. 

Or if you're up to writing AUs, maybe a soulmates AU or them meeting under different circumstances. With or without any of the other nominated characters.

Honestly, I'm a huge sucker for crazy sitcom shenanigans if you feel up to writing them! Give me all the fluff and humor you have, or make me cry but with a happy ending.

The Night Shift (TV 2014) 
Drew Alister, Rick Lincoln

I'm super eager for more of Rick and Drew.  I would be particularly keen to read a story exploring their early relationship, who made the first move, other firsts, and so forth.  But anything you're inspired to write about them will surely delight me.  So much of their life together is off-screen; show some of what we're missing, pretty please!

Any rating is fine, as are most common kinks. You're welcome to incorporate any other characters from the show and/or from your imagination, as long as the primary focus stays on Rick and Drew (e.g., please don't make the story all about Brianna). I'd rather not read anything nonconsensual or particularly cracky, nor cheating, nor deathfic; angst is okay in reasonable quantities; humor is great; and happy endings are my preference. *Please* don't break up Rick and Drew unless you're reuniting them before the story ends.

Still Star-Crossed (TV) 
Isabella of Verona (Still Star-Crossed)

I found Isabella to be one of the most fascinating and, unfortunately, underutilized characters of the series.  Although I'm holding out hope for the show to get renewed and her story to get more exploration, in the meantime, I'd be thrilled to get your take on her.  I'm especially interested in her as a queer, female-identifying person of color, so, please do not negate any of those facets of her character, if you go an AU route with the story.

I'd prefer femslash or gen.  A gen story could explore her childhood, for example, or showcase her strength, capability, and badassery through current/future adventures in political intrigue.

Any rating is fine, as are most common kinks. You're welcome to incorporate any other characters from the show and/or from your imagination, as long as the primary focus stays on Isabella.  You could pair her with one or more of the other nominated women, or Tessa, or an original character, but preferably *not* with Lady Capulet.  I'd rather not read anything nonconsensual or particularly cracky, nor deathfic; angst is okay in reasonable quantities; humor is great; and happy endings are my preference.

Quantico (TV) 
Sebastian Chen, Harry Doyle (Quantico)

These two are almost literally begging for a mission that forces them to explore their feelings, physically and verbally.  (Undercover married couple, perhaps?)  I'm up for any story about them, though.  I felt like the second half of season two left them very short-shrifted, both as individuals and as a potential couple.  How did Sebastian feel about sending away Harry, and would Harry truly have left Sebastian in danger?  What might they have done, separately or together, to help the cause without Alex and the rest of the team even realizing?  What would it take for them to pare down all the pretense and obfuscation to who they really are and what they really feel?  You could write missing scenarios from any past canon timeline or what the future looks like for them.

Any rating is fine, as are most common kinks. As long as the primary focus stays on these two, you're welcome to incorporate any other characters from the show (like clever Will! whom I forgot to nominate) and/or from your imagination. I'd rather not read anything nonconsensual or particularly cracky, nor fic incorporating major character deaths beyond canon; angst is okay in reasonable quantities; humor is great; and happy endings are my preference.

I love her as a friend to Kirsten, Quincy, and Cameron, and I love her as a headstrong employee of Maggie.  I love her singing with her guitar.  She's smart and tough and awesome.  Whatever inspires you to show off her shininess would be fantastic.

Any rating is fine, as are most common kinks. You're welcome to incorporate any other characters from the show and/or from your imagination, as long as the primary focus stays on Camille, but please limit the presence of Kirsten's various family members in the story.  In Camille's case I lean more toward Camille/Amanda or Camille/Linus -- or all three together! -- than any other ships.

I adore Sam.  As much as I enjoyed the show and cared about the rest of the family, Sam was the pure heart of it all for me.  Absolutely anything you want to share about Sam before, during, or after canon would make me happy.

Please respect Sam's identity.

Any rating is fine, as are most common kinks, although it's extremely important to me that Sam be old enough to feel comfortable -- mentally and physically -- with any sexual activity in the story, if you go that route. You're welcome to incorporate any other characters from the show and/or from your imagination, as long as the primary focus stays on Sam.  If you're a fellow fan of The Fosters show and you'd like to crossover Jude into this story in some capacity, that'd be cool.

ロード・エルメロイⅡ世の事件簿 | Lord El-Melloi II Case Files 
Reines El-Melloi Archisorte (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files), Flat Escardos (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files), Waver Velvet | Lord El-Melloi II (ロード・エルメロイⅡ世の事件簿 | Lord El-Melloi II Case Files), Grey (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files)

When I heard about the Lord El-Melloi II Case Files being released at the end of 2014, I was absolutely thrilled. Waver finally having his own series was truly a delight, and hearing that the focus was his time between the Fourth and Fifth War, with his crew of students plus Reines sent me over the moon - especially since it involved more Flat. Now that we have volume 1 translated, I can only say that I’m glad for the series and glad to have a new cast of characters to explore.

What I love about the characters I’ve chosen is their dynamic with Waver. Flat makes life chaotic, oh yes, but Waver endures him for some reason - apparently out of concern for Flat’s safety, if the wiki is anything to go by. Gray is absolutely fascinating as a character because of her lineage, yes, but also because she’s stuck beside Waver and acts as his assistant. I’d love to see more of that, and then, then there’s Reines. I adore the relationship we’ve seen between Reines and Waver so far, with her treating him like a servant or sibling depending on what she needs from him. This particular relationship strikes me as the most unique in the series, as it’s very much a patronage sort of arrangement, with enough close affection for it to be genuine but an unshakeable power dynamic as well.

Honestly, there’s a lot I’d like to see. An exploration of what the above relationships are like beyond what we’re given in canon would be lovely. For example, we know in Fate/apocrypha that Flat sometimes takes VH out to the movies, but that serves to pose more questions like what kind of low-key shenanigans happen on a daily basis? How does the group say, control VH’s terminator outbursts? How have Reines and Waver developed their relationship since he was first given the Lord El-Melloi II title? How does Gray spend her days off when she isn’t around Waver? What challenges faces this group as a whole? Or perhaps there are other cases they’ve gotten into that we haven’t seen. 

Then again, there’s also the conclusion of volume one of the Case Files, where Waver agrees that he would take Gray to the next Grail War so she could meet Rider. How might that meeting go? What would Rider think of Gray, and Waver being halfway between her teacher and her parent?

Fate/Grand Order 
Alexander | Rider (Fate/Grand Order), Zhuge Kongming | Caster (Fate/Grand Order), Leonardo da Vinci | Caster (Fate/Grand Order)

Note: Not everyone named must be included in the fic.
Simply put, Fate/Grand Order is an insane mishmash of seemingly all the good and bad in Fate/ with a particular emphasis on the wildest storylines imaginable and truly ridiculous character moments mixed with serious ones. It is the last part that truly has me interested in Grand Order as an entry into Fate/, and that is what I’m requesting here.

With all that said, Fate/Grand Order's interpretation of Leonardo DaVinci’s a delight, she really is, and I’d really be up for anything involving her. I’d love to see how she decided on her Top Five Hotties list (no English translation but the list speaks for itself), or else what she does when she isn’t running the shop. Anything about servants she gets on with, or doesn’t, would be awesome too, as would any reflection on how the modern world compares to the Renaissance she lived through.

Otherwise, I'm very interested in the relationship between Zhuge Liang!Waver and Alexander. The difference in Alexander's age is have enjoyed the game's exploration of so far, but I'd love to see more either with the two at rest or them getting into their own additional adventures.

Fate/Grand Order has an English release available on your smartphone. For translations beyond what the ENG game has,Cirnopedia and Chaldeum are the best. Reddit has collected summaries of major events.

It is no mystery at all why I completely imprinted on this book. What is a mystery, however, is how I survived to this day and age without having loved Nimona for years - how did I even live unaware of its existence, up until an impulse purchase a month ago? WHAT A TRAVESTY.

Anyway, I massively adore Nimona to bits: a perfect fusion of story and pictures, chaotic evil Nimona (CHOMP!), Ballister of the big heart and stoic love for strays and SCIENCE, Ambrosius of awkward good instincts and poor decisions  - I just want to pinch everyone’s cheeks and hug them to my chest. For six hours. Approximately. It’s open for negotiation :’)

I’m requesting any characters because I’d be honestly delighted by seeing each one of them &lt;3

A day in casa de Blackheart with Nimona and Ballister! Hatching evil schemes or having a pizza night - or both. BOTH IS GOOD. A flashback to Ballister and Ambrosius’s younger days (that christmas special *clutches heart*). A future with Nimona infiltrating Ballister’s lab and his &amp; Ambrosius’s couch with popcorn and underhanded science! Nimona grumpily acquiescing to Goldenloin’s presence in Ballister’s life!

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Luke Sunborn (In Other Lands)

Elliot is a spectacular narrator. Novel-shaped case in point: In Other Lands.

Having said that, what I really, really want to see is a story that makes Luke a narrator, or otherwise puts him at the center. I have it on good authority that he makes one fucking adorable narrator (novella-shaped case in point: Wings in the Morning), but why stop there, right?

-  Luke/Elliot, either post-canon or slightly amending canon, is always a delight. Luke crushing on Elliot for years in a resigned, semi-unaware (or aware!) manner - he gives Elliot Dale’s name only as a distraction, to get Elliot off his back, and watches with horrified eyes how every member of his family is suddenly out there to set him up with the wrong boy! Luke handling the thought of Elliot the boyfriend with awkwardness unbefitting a Trigon champion (granted, Elliot is kinda more prickly than an average glass ball). Luke having 110% confidence in Elliot and admiring him sass people into submission from the sidelines.

- A look at Luke’s friendship with Serene - completely compatible with Luke forever crushing on Elliot, just saying ^^. I suspect lack of Elliot’s Serene goggles could do marvels to building nuance to her character: a little less reverse gender comedy just for the sake of comedy, a little more someone who is clever enough to balance multiple things, connect the dots, and learn, and stand by what she believes is right.

-  Competence kinkkk. Forever admiring the bookish people, refusing to stop trying to catch up, and zero time spent being conceited about own achievements while fully embracing his role of a champion and defender - that’s the Luke I love &lt;3 Luke’s brand of leadership &amp; charisma - an introverted champion, well-loved by people and easily tired of company of not his people.

- Figuring out life after graduation! Casefic of them solving a mystery and preventing a war breakout! Getting assignments and storming the castles! Building cross-cultural competence by throwing Elliot at new people and watching him sign up new pen friends and treaties!

-  Sunborn family fic! A holiday get together? Drunken exchange of family stories? Another terrible competition that Elliot boycotts? Rachel reading Luke’s letters from year one and with great amusement observing the progression of his “THAT ELLIOT” feelings. God I love the Sunborns &lt;3

I’m not particularly fond of Dale, on understanding that he got enough screentime as is already I’d be grateful if you didn’t center the fic around him. Obviously no objections to him as part of class ensemble, whose names Luke will never bloody remember.

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince), Auguste (Captive Prince), Jokaste (Captive Prince)

You would not have wanted to see me at the peak of my CP obsession - dignity readers for miles around were in the red zone for months, I can tell you that. Even my bitter disappointment with many things in the third book didn’t survive the onslaught of feelings that overcome me every time I turn my thoughts to this series. R e g u l a r l y. (If you don’t think Prince’s Gambit is the high point of modern literature, f i t e   m e)

Things that make me happy:

- Laurent/Damen endgame, always.

- Auguste! Alive and well and fiercely proud of Laurent and quite possibly giving young Damen - his admiring bro - confused boners. Which he manfully swoonstruggles against, because see above.

- Clever, competent Damen that drives Laurent up the wall of his fervent refusal to admit any of it affects him

- Laurent POVs in general. There is nothing more delightful than a well-crafted narration of acerbic denial of hearteyes, self-crafted personality, hardwon competence and utter self-awareness.

- Did I say competence porn yet? Hearteyes, motherfucker, hearteyes!!

- Jokaste-Laurent queenbee friendships - vipers united!

- Consider this: FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS arrangement for a CERTAIN AGENDA feat. Jokaste and Laurent - preceding or purposefully leading to Laurent/Damen endgame. Benefits as imagined by Damen, the poor cookie? Fake dating for purposes of short-circuiting Damen’s brain with the blonde ratio? :DD

- Mafia/noir AUs *swoon* In fact, a variety of modern or historic AUs would be an a+ sandbox to play in and watch the chemistry unfold.

- On another note, I have the soft spot the size of Delfeur for Nicaise and particularly Nicaise &amp; Laurent spiky sibling-like affection, so if you think your story could benefit from that, please don’t hesitate to include it &lt;3

I’m absolutely okay with fic that would not include all four - it’s just that I couldn’t omit either Auguste and Jokaste from the list of happy things. You are most welcome to include only one of the two, or none, if you want to concentrate on Laurent and Damen only.

Canon divergences, what-ifs and AUs are super-welcome for this canon. Please feel free to play to your heart’s content!

Mentor relationships were amazing - Cheris and Jedao in Ninefox Gambit was a thing of true beauty, Zehun and Mikodez continuously delight me, and I’m looking forward to what book 3 will bring on this front, too (Nija? Please say Nija!). But as I need to choose something that won’t be guaranteed to make the matching algorithm cry, let me center it around a character that delights me and makes others cry instead.

- Mikodez in his younger days! Zehun, I’m so sorry for your loss of sleep and possibly hair, teenagers are the worst, teenage Miki is the worst best Miki, and I am dying to hear all about his notorious Academy heroics.

- Mikodez, Zehun, Nija and Cheris, the most terrifying parental equation of this calendar &lt;3

- Mikodez and his Questionable Alliances. Kujen “I had a friend once and then the leash broke” Nirai. Jedao - how does Miki’s view of the man change with Cheris in the game, and her (literal) insights about the dead mad general?

- Mikodez throwing endless shade on all other factions, especially Andan. (Sorry, Andan. At least you’re pretty.)

- Mikodez and his secret humanitarian agenda that he will politely deny forever, get fake-distracted by one of his bazillion hobbies and miss whatever sleep time he had scheduled in the day because he will inevitably get genuinely carried away. Every. Fucking. Time.

- As a sidenote, I’m terribly fond of Vahenz &lt;3 Bring her back! Let Vahenz have her fun! Let Mikodez meet his true competition for world domination and in the race towards diabetes.

I really liked Istradez, and would be happy to see him among the army of Mikodez’s high powered babysitters, but am not really in the market for Mikodez/Istradez shipfics.

My <i>feels</i> whenever Lucien does something boneheaded and reckless and Jean or Matthew find out! What I'd like is something where the two of them have a conversation (and given it's the two of them, conversation could be in sharply-avoided glances and increasing frown lines). I'm leaning angsty in this request, but if you want to try for comedy or exasperation, again: love to see it! Threesome gleefully welcomed, or Matthew stoically stepping aside because social mores (all the internet if Jean exasperatedly drags him back inside and everyone pointedly Does Not Talk but it all gets sorted!)

no trigger warnings, no heavy angst, no drug use (apart from the one in the show), no graphic depictions of past abuse (that is to say that if it's relevant to the story, you can mention it, but gloss over it), no mpreg, no daddy!kink.

I'm okay with M/M/F, but mainly I'd like Worrick/Nicolas. College!AU in the same 'verse as the anime, where the whole Twilights thing is not a secret and they're not hunted, but it's something the gov takes pride in because the Twilights aren't as berserk-ers as they are in the anime. Still, a question remains: what's Worrick doing there and why does he have someone shadowing him? (they don't know each other in this 'verse)

AU. Ragnar is smitten with Athelstan. Athelstan takes a while to come around, mostly because he thinks that Ragnar's not serious about him (given that women and men alike flock to him like he's a shepherd), but what Athelstan doesn't know (yet) is that no one holds Ragnar's attention like he does.

Spark keeps visiting Dr. Willow's center, always bringing in at least one Pokemon. Spark's excuse: they follow me no matter what I do or say. Dr. Willow realizes (some time later) that he looks forward to Spark's visits and his bubbly energy and enthusiasm towards Pokemon. In particular towards Pidgeys.

The Girl with the Silver Eyes - Willo Davis Roberts 

Okay so: WHAT DID THEY DECIDE? AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THEY DECIDED? I feel like staying home would be the wiser choice, but going would be the better story. And there are so many directions it could go, once they go. Also, it's canon that there are other superpowered kids with all different kinds of superpowers there, so there is a lot of scope for crossovers there... I'd also love more about the lives and personalities of the other three silver-eyed kids - how similar are they to Katie? How different? How do they get along when it's not a crisis situation? I'm also really interested in all the grown-ups from the books! Also I headcanon that Ms. K also has some kind of secret psi powers. And ship her with Mr. C.

The Murderbot Diaries - Martha Wells 

I cannot get enough of Murderbot? So mostly I would just like More Of. Here are some ideas: Something set in the Preservation Aux camp (any POV) before canon started when all was calm, or Murderbot dealing with one of its previous more-soap-opera-y past assignments (either before or just after it hacked itself), or something from one of the surveys on the planet before everything went terrible - how different are they from each other personality-wise? How do they work together on group assignments?, or there's just a bare possibility that one or more of the other secbots survived - what did they do? maybe they got left behind for dead and learned how to hack themselves and became hobby archeologists; or everyone on the station gossiping about what Murderbot has done this time. I also really loved the glimpses we got of what life is like in the Preservation Alliance, so anything building on what the Survey crew do after Murderbot leaves would be fun!

DNW: Anything where Murderbot just needs to Learn To Make Friends And Talk About Its Feelings or equivalent. Let Murderbot continue to be someone who is happiest sitting in a corner with its shows! That is OK! Also: no Murderbot falling in love with anyone. Other Secbots making other choices is fine though.

James Asher Vampire Series - Barbara Hambly 

I OT3 this hard! I just keep waiting for the point where James finally realizes he and Simon are in love with each other too and it's a triangle not a V, and it keeps not happening for me in canon. I really want a story set after Pale Guardian where James slowly comes to the realization that Ysidro has transferred his promise to watch Lydia into a promise to watch over James. I would also love any backstory for any of the three of them, though! I am also getting increasingly intrigued by Grippen and his relationship with James and or/Ysidro. I'd also enjoy anything about the ancient vampires Ysidro remembers from his youth. Also: would be okay with just a series of attempts by Ysidro to convince a cat to be his friend.

I am also okay with crossing over Ysidro into a far-future SF fandom, those are always cool and I'd love to see how Hambly's vampires work in that kind of world (Also see my Benjamin January request.)

Also: Rose and/or Chloe doing SCIENCE!! (or science) and/or interacting* with any of the Great Men Of Science of the time. *where interaction could = explosion. And anything else in this fandom, really, honestly. Also, if you also know the Ashers books, I would love some of those vampires showing up in January's world - either via Hyacinthe, who almost certainly learned her piano from January, or just stumbling over them in their travels.

Vicki is one of my all time favorite characters, with her prickly attitude and her dark sense of humor.

If you want to write porn or romance,  het and slash are both welcome but I prefer someone other than Mike to pair her with - I don't hate him, but he's just about the least interesting guy in that whole universe. OMC/OFC is okay but I'd prefer a canon character even if they're from a single-episode (not Norman, though.)

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) 
Dastan (Prince of Persia), Tamina (Prince of Persia)

Dear Yuletide author,
I've always longed to know how Dastan and Tamina built their life together after the events of the film. The ending scenes seem to show them on horseback upon a cliff, looking toward the same desert they crossed in the alternate timeline; so I imagine there will be more adventures for the couple, and chances to get to know each other.
I'd love to read a fanfic on this future. It would be great to see Dastan win Tamina's heart all over again and, eventually, reveal her the truth about their past. With their spunky interactions, different natures and the added complication of his brothers and father being alive, the recipe promises a lot of goodness :D
The how and where are entirely up to you! Just give me some Dastan/Tamina love &lt;3 

I LOVE world-building, adventure and angst, especially when there is a happy resolution. I also love humor and quick, to-the-point dialogues. I have no major squicks but don't like S/M, overbearing love interests nor death fic. All ratings go, though I'm partial to mature themes and situations (not necessarily smutty, but if there are, even better!). I appreciate all story formats, from drabble collection to longfic.
Hope you have fun writing this! I know I will when I'll read it :D

Georgie! (Manga) 
Georgie Butman / Gerald, Abel Butman

Dear Yuletide Author,
this manga is one of my major childhood loves and, while I adore it in its every facet, Abel's death still wounds me. So I would absolutely <i>love</i> to receive a fic where he's miraculously saved, maybe by our heroes managing to stop the pistol from being shot, maybe by a luckily-placed coin, maybe by a doctor who finds he's not dead when they're taking his body away and cures him (that would have the added bonus of a happy shock for Georgie!). So, in short, I'd love to read about saved!Abel getting to know his son and his father-in-law, to protect his family and see his brother again.
If that doesn't inspire, I'll happily settle for something set when Georgie realizes she <i>does</i> love him in a non-brotherly way and comes to terms with her own desires.

I don't have any particular squicks; angst with a happy resolution is welcome, and sensual or smutty scenes are great. The only major DNW is character death (obviously), followed by unhappy endings, S&amp;M and things too strident to be in this fandom ;D
I love quick witty dialogues and honest interactions. Any story format is alright - drabble/flashfic collection, oneshot, multichapter (a dream, haha!). Just not theatre script or just dialogue, please.
Thank you very much for reading!

this year's requests are dedicated to my childhood loves, and this one might be the greatest! Everything from the locations to the actors, to the imagery, to the music and the mysterious, misty atmosphere giving way to sunny country hits my \"like\" buttons :D
And since I've been a Mary/Dickon shipper since the dawn of time, I'd be super-happy to read a fic where thei relationship evolves while they're growing in the manor's gardens, either seen through Martha's eyes or not (she's optional). The more nature is in it, the better!

I don't have any particular squicks, angst is welcome, and sensual or smutty scenes are fine for their adult selves. The only major DNW is character death, followed by unhappy endings, S&amp;M and things too strident to be in this fandom ;D

Niji no Densetsu | Legend of the Rainbow (Manga) 
Olga of Glen, Karl Feldt Jensen La Tour Von Lindgren

Dear Yuletide Author,
As it is the year of golden oldies for me, here I am, sending a new request for this fandom! Cannot help myself. Adrian has always been my favourite, but I like Karl Feldt too and, while I detested Olga as a child, the epilogue special where she was shown falling in love with haughty Karl made her grow on me. I'd love to read a continuation of their relationship, which started as both snotty and awkward, now that there's a wedding on the horizon and a family short afterward. Give me all the shy, tender, obstentatious, bitchy moments with them arguing or romancing each other you can think of, and I'll be a happy camper :D
The actual events and location(s) are up to you, though I'm partial to nature and wild sceneries. And I'd love to see the birth of a crown prince...
Plus, if you happen to put in cameos of the other main characters for humour purposes, that would be great! Adrian's sarcasm is something else.

I don't have any particular squicks, angst is welcome, and sensual or smutty scenes are more than okay. The only major DNW is character death, followed by unhappy endings, S&amp;M and things too strident to be in this fandom ;D

Amnesia (Game & Anime) 
Heroine (Amnesia), Ukyo (Amnesia)

Dear Yuletide author,
The Amnesia game was one of last year's greatest fandom discoveries, for me, and I'd love to read some Ukyo x Heroine goodness for Xmas :D
It would be awesome if you could use a setting that scrambled the various worlds together and made the heroine remember all of a sudden all her past lives, with related conflicts and loves and betrayals. Even better if the boys remembered one by one too, some time after seeing her (in my mind they all know each other, like in Ukyo's world; it could also be set there?). Shin would be the first.
Much angst, doubts and conflicting desires would arise while everyone tries to decide if they want/should pursue her. Heroine would feel confused and guilty, because she cares for them all yet there is too much among them now - not to mention the fact that she 'should' be with Ukyo this time, after choosing the others so many times.
I've liked pretty much all routes (minus Toma's); Shin's is my favourite despite his bad mouth, I think his relationship with Heroine is the strongest - so he should be the main rival. I like Ukyo too, despite his madness; he  made a great sacrifice that, in time, transformed him into a monster. Overcoming that madness and working out its causes should be one of the major point of the story.

I know that working with too specific a prompt can be an inspiration-killer, though, so if all of the above doesn't click with you, I'll be ecstatic with romantic smut or fluff too! Possibly with Heroine (whom I've always called Mai) holding back out of fear, then being assertive and not just an understanding doormat. Definitely max joy with playful, smutty fluff!

I've played only Amnesia Memories and read the handful of manga chapters that were translated by a couple of bloggers.
I LOVE heavy angst, especially when there is a happy resolution (if there's a touch of bittersweet = squee). I also love quick, to-the-point dialogues and wordplay. I have no major squicks but don't like S/M, overbearing love interests nor death fic (though it's a moot point with this fandom, lol). All ratings go, though I'm partial to mature themes and situations - not necessarily smutty, but if there are, even better!

Dear Yuletide author,
My wish for this fandom is quite simple: I would love to read about Alan and Sarah growing together after Jumanji took them back to the past. I've always imagined that their bond would be stronger than ever, and that sharing such a secret would make for a bumpy but fun ride (not exempt from a nightmare or two, but that's to be expected). Other than that, surprise me! :3

I love humor, fluff, angst and happy or hopeful endings. I also love quick witty dialogues and honest interactions. I have no major squicks but would prefer not to have slash here, definitely no death fic. All ratings go, though I'm partial to mature themes (if there's romantic smut, even better!).

The Wolf of Winter - Paula Volsky 
Varis (The Wolf of Winter), Shalindra (The Wolf of Winter)

I'm requesting both Varis and Shalindra as characters, but I don't need them both to appear on-screen or in POV--what I'm really just dying to get is some kind of fic that gives me another taste of their interactions with and impact on each other. Their time together is one of the most interesting parts of the book for me, but necessity of pacing means that the weeks of time Shalindra spends as Varis's hostage/'guest' gets swept past rather quickly, so a fic expanding on that time period is one thing I'd love to see. A couple of sentences, for examples, mention that once Shalindra is being kept in better conditions she and Varis usually dine together, so what did that look like? What did they talk about? (Dinner scenes that are tense or emotionally charged in some way are one of my favorite things to read, so this is one of those skimmed-over details that I desperately wish we had an actual example of in the book!) I have to admit I'm also darkly tempted by the thought of an AU where the proposed marriage went through for whatever reason--how in the world would both of them have navigated that relationship?--or where Shalindra didn't quite have the strength to ask Varis to take her out of the crypt, and gave in to the unspoken offer of further instruction in necromancy.

Varis's POV scene during some point of Shalindra's captivity could be really interesting, too. We only get a few scenes from his perspective in the latter part of the novel, but the couple of times we do his thoughts about Shalindra are very striking--particularly that scene were he's in a post-necromancy waking nightmare and thinks of her face and her voice as a point of light and sanity in the madness. Something about his first impressions of her once she's been captured, maybe, or his thoughts after the crypt scene?

Or I'd love to see some kind of Shalindra fic set post-canon, as the conclusion is a pretty interesting happy-yet-not ending--Shalindra's been too changed to celebrate her brother's victory and Varis's defeat the way she once would have, and certain elements of her world are already starting to feel grating, unsatisfying, or dull to her. So I always wonder: what is she going to do from now on? Is she truly going to manage to resist the lure of necromancy for the rest of her life? Or would she take advantage of her new position and resources--a titled noble, with time and money and the research skills that come from her years as an enforced scholar at Fruce--and begin exploring the forbidden art again?

Given the situation Varis is in at the book's conclusion (spifflicated in that shack in the woods and so ragged and dishelved that the few patrols who've come across him haven't recognized him), it's very unlikely that Shalindra will encounter him again after the book's end--but if she did turn back to necromancy and let a sufficient number of years pass, might she able to summon his ghost? Would she try to do it, if only to assuage her own curiosity about him and why he'd let her go? I don't know how lucid a ghost!Varis would be--I can't remember if we see any ghosts of spifflicates in the book--but the two of them having one last conversation and their previous power dynamic of captor/captive being so completely reversed into necromancer/ghost is an idea I can't get out of my brain.

My dislikes/DNWs are:
- blatant character-bashing
- mundane/modern AUs
- A/B/O of any kind
- body fluids besides blood, sweat, and tears
- damage to eyes, teeth, fingernails, and inner ears
- incredibly detailed descriptions of insects and arachnids
- graphic violence to/torture of animals

Blending Series - Sharon Green 
Jovvi Hafford, Tamrissa Domon

If gen fic is your speed, anything that draws from the warm and genuine friendliness that Jovvi and Tamrissa have in the books would delight me. Their initial connection and developing relationship was one of the best parts of the first couple of volumes for me and I was always a little disappointed that we didn't get more of that as the books went on, so any kind of fic that includes a good dose of that would be a treat for me--anything from fluffy curtainfic (shopping! tea-drinking! doing anything pleasant and fun to distract themselves from the conspiracy they've gotten wrapped up in!) to something more tense and dramatic where they're supporting each other through upsetting moments. It would have been nice to get a more emotional scene after Jovvi's near-kidnapping in the second book, or one when they reunite after they've BOTH been kidnapped in the fourth book, so filling in that gap would be lovely!

If you want to write smut, there's always fixing that illogical canon fact of 'Everyone having sex with each other will make your Blending stronger--oh, but only the men with the women, of course! No same-sex hookups here!' Maybe it turns out that all the Blending partners really do need to couple off and bang each other at least once; maybe Jovvi and Tamrissa think and talk it through and come to the logical conclusion that even though they weren't told *they* had to have sex with each other, they should probably do so just in case. (Maybe one or both of them have been tentatively drawn to the other, and they're just using 'for the good of the Blending' as an excuse!) Or--we know Tamrissa's former husband was rough and cruel during sex, and in the books her first sexual experience after him is with Rion, which...okay, sure, go for the guy who literally just lost his virginity a few days ago, whatever. How about instead she goes to Jovvi, who's highly skilled in this area and has the added bonus of a Spirit talent that can help keep Tamrissa feeling safe, calm, and comfortable throughout? Or there's that bit where Tamrissa learns from Jovvi that Fire talents really do have the ability to arouse people by 'setting their blood on fire'--maybe Jovvi could suggest that if Tamrissa would like to learn how to get better at it, she can practice on Jovvi?

If you'd like to do something AUish, I'd adore a fic about the two of them skipping out of the main plot and whatever prophecy nonsense was going on and doing their own thing. Maybe they leave the city (or the entire country) and just live in peaceful reclusive bliss elsewhere. Maybe they do what Jovvi suggests in the first book and become an awesome courtesan duo and make scads of money at it. Maybe they, IDK, use their High talents to become elegant upper-class spies or adventuresses or something. I just love the idea of them ditching their somewhat aggravating canon love interests and going off to live a happy life of luxury, indulging in chocolate and beautiful clothes and great sex (with each other and maybe with whatever men they feel like) for the rest of their days.

Dark Tower - Stephen King 
Gabrielle Deschain (Dark Tower - Stephen King)

Oh dear, where to start with Gabrielle? I think what I'd most love to see in general is a fic that lets her be the central focus and doesn't come through Roland's point of view. I like Roland well enough (I don't know if you can get through the series if you don't!) but sometimes the hints of other stories happening around and behind him make me wish I could nudge him out of the way for a little bit to get a better look at what's going on, and Gabrielle's a major instance of that. Her life and death, what she does and what's done to her, have a tremendous effect on Roland and thus on the course of the books as a whole--but so much of what we get of her in the canon is as a shadow and a memory filtered through the particular cast of Roland's recollection and emotions, and that's such a limited view of her. I realize the canon is pretty overstuffed with material as it is, but it's still frustrating to me that Gabrielle's living her way through an entire damn operatic tragedy in service to the overall story but gets so little time of her own as an actual character. There's that one critical scene of her on-page in The Gunslinger, and the broken snippets of her own thoughts in the note she leaves for Roland in The Wind Through the Keyhole--and, arguably, the story about Tim in The Wind Through the Keyhole *might* have touches of her personality and mindset hidden in the details too, since Roland's trying to tell it exactly as it was told to him by Gabrielle....

That's not a lot! So I'd adore just about any kind of fic that moves her into the foreground of the story. Something about the early days of her marriage and her time as the Lady of Gilead? We never find out much about what ladies of Gabrielle's sort do in their day-to-day life, so that could be fertile ground for exploration. A better look at the webs and threads of the Steven-Gabrielle-Marten saga? I would love ANY perspective other than Roland's on Gabrielle and her role in that whole fucked-up situation, honestly, or anything that really dug down to the marrow of the Gabrielle/Steven and Gabrielle/Marten relationships. Exactly what went on during her time in Debaria after the affair? What was she thinking about? How did she interact with the sisters there? Even something about her childhood and upbringing, if you feel like going totally off the map of what we know about her! There are little slivers of dropped info about her that could spin off into an interesting story: the fact that we know her father's name (TWO names, actually, since King and his editor apparently weren't keeping close track of that) but not her mother's; her own various names from her homeland; the rhymes and stories she told Roland.... What sort of things did she like to do? What did she hope for herself in her life? Which of the things she did were choices she made herself, and which were ones other people (or ka) made for her? I'd also be happy to see canon-divergent fic, if you want to play around with what-ifs and might-have-happeneds. I don't know if it's possible to pull out a happy ending for her (though if inspiration strikes I certainly won't discourage you!), but so much of what happens in the books is the result of people making specific decisions at specific moments--we have that one instance of Gabrielle at Debaria struggling to make the correct choice, and choosing what she does because she feels it's demanded of her. It could be interesting to see instances where she--or the people around her--make different choices throughout her life, and how that wrenches the overall story of her and the world in different directions!

Hello Yuletide Writer!  Thank you so much for writing me a story - I can't wait to see what you create! In general, please avoid any explicit sexual situations (or reference to non-con), character death, or AUs. Otherwise, I'm pretty flexible.

For MCOG, I would love to see a story taking place within the original series (not the new one that came out a few years ago) that can slot into the plot at the time.  If you want to do a day-in-the-life on the trail sort of thing, that works fine.  If you want to do a break from the action for a hurt/comfort, that works for me!  If you want to have somebody musing about the dynamic between characters, yay!  For me, really, MCOG is about the bond between the 3 kids, and the unique place Mendoza fits into it.  Is he a big brother or father?  An enemy?  Does he even know?  I'm also very, very fond of Esteban and his connection to Zia.  It isn't a childish crush, in my opinion, but what it is can be up to you.  Just something that highlights what the kids are to one another, and where life will take them, as long as it takes them together!

For this one, I would absolutely love something funny.  Give me Sophie versus magic, or Howl and another hissy fit that takes a turn for the silly.  Give me Calcifer having FEELINGS about Sophie and Howl's PDA.  If you want to place this after the movie, that's great -- during also works.  I think I just want to see their little family having some fun.  Or fun at their expense.  Whichever.  If you want to add a deeper level, Howl has a hissy fit but it leads to a genuinely tender moment between them, that's fantastic.  But I'm happy with straight-up silly, too.  Let your inner magical realism sense of wacky fly!

I think what I would like most is a post-movie something.  Haku visiting Chihiro and watching over her.  Haku and Zeniiba developing a relationship of their own.  Chihiro wandering back to visit Zeniiba when she's feeling down about high school.  Zeniiba at Haku and Chihiro's wedding.  I dunno.  Just...something that links them together, like the hairband woven for Chihiro so long ago.  Funny works, tragic works, but whatever it is, I would like it to be sweet.

In this case, I am WILDLY flexible.  No, seriously.  Whatever you come up with, I just want more of it.  You can go pre-movie, during the movie, or post-movie.  I would rather we stick somewhat close to the WW timeline -- my knowledge of BvS is entirely limited to the \"Everything Wrong With\" YouTube video.   I love Diana being awesome and badass and utterly unconcerned about the modern world and its foibles.  I love the Amazon world and culture and I want more of it!  Pick your favorite scene that should have been from the movie or the universe and give me that and I'll be happy.  As long as Diana is still badass.  :-)

In Other Lands - Sarah Rees Brennan 
Elliot Schafer (In Other Lands), Luke Sunborn (In Other Lands), Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle (In Other Lands), Golden-Hair-Scented-Like-Summer (In Other Lands)

This book is my absolute catnip and I love everything about it, so something similar to canon would make me very happy. I love Elliot's sarcasm and his genuine sense of wonder about magic, and the way Luke doggedly keeps trying to be a good person. I love Serene's stubbornness and her loyalty to her friends and look, I love all the stupid sexist things the elves say, the joke never wears thin for me, I almost cry laughing every single time. We don't get to see a whole lot of Golden but I love that he's basically a feisty Regency romance heroine and I want him and Elliot to be best friends. You can write about them all together or in any combination you want -- I would be especially interested in Golden getting to know Elliot or something about Luke and Serene's star-crossed sisterhood, and of course Luke/Elliot in the foreground or background would be delightful because I am nothing if not predictable. I love outsider POV and we don't get to hear a lot of what Serene thinks throughout the book, so getting her perspective on events could be cool. Or maybe something epistolary like the letters she and Golden have been writing to each other? Or hey, if you're in this fandom for the wingkink, I'm not going to say no! (I also think it would be extremely funny if Elliot and Golden bonded over wing-sex and whatever equivalent strange quirk Serene has.) Just in general, a post-canon story about everyone figuring out their relationships and their futures would be lovely. If you would rather write about the events that happen during the book, please get us as far as everyone's feelings being requited? I know I could just reread the ending of the book and achieve resolution but I'm oversensitive and people being sad about their unrequited feelings makes me sad.

Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong (Graphic Novel) 
Charlie (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong), Nate (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong)

My favorite scene in this entire book is when Charlie is hiding from his own party under his bed and Nate knows exactly where he'll be and comes to keep him company. The two of them hit my \"I'm an asshole but I'm *your* asshole\" button perfectly, and I'd love a story in that vein. Does Nate mellow out as he gets older? Does Charlie get more effective at calling him out when he's being a jerk? What are they like in senior year (do they actually run for Class President and VP together?) or in college? (Tangentially, I love Joanna but I thought that the narrative was leading up to Joanna/Holly and I felt very betrayed when we ended up with Charlie/Joanna instead: please feel free to include Joanna and Holly. Do they pretend their dates are meetings of the Charlie's Exes Club so that Nate won't crash them like a creeper? Does Nate try to join every time he and Charlie have a fight?) I'd love a wacky robots caper with Nate/Charlie happening in the background, and I would also love something sweet (well, as sweet as Nate can get) about them getting together or getting through something as a couple -- maybe their first holiday after telling their families they're together, or renting their first apartment, or some other important milestone. I do want Nate to be Nate (I don't think he's ever going to become a gentle or sensitive person) but I'd love to see him being protective of Charlie in his own abrasive way. I'd also love to see Charlie standing up for himself, or realizing that he has someone to support him if he needs it.

I will be completely caught up on whatever Jeph does between now and reveals but please don't worry about taking it into account, I know it's frustrating to work with an ongoing canon. Feel free to take \"Clinton has a crush on Brun, Elliot has a crush on both Clinton and Brun, Brun's feelings are as yet unknown\" as the established starting point and go from there. And what a great starting point! I've been so excited to see this scenario unfold -- I don't really like jealousy or love triangles but Elliot and Clinton both realizing how great (and genuinely kind, which is my favorite thing about both of them) the other is made my heart grow three sizes. I love Brun and how direct she is and I think that if anyone could handle making it work with the Softest Bro and Highest Strung Nerd, it's her. With that said, I know that Brun's sexual orientation has yet to be revealed and I think it would be entirely in character for her to set boundaries on what she is and isn't interested in doing. That's totally fine! OT3 is not a one-size-fits-all dynamic, and I think there are tons of different takes on how their relationship would play out. (If you *want* to write asexual femdom Brun, GO FOR IT.) I also love Renee and Claire and think a story about them trying to set up Clinton and Elliot (while not realizing that Clinton, Elliot and Brun are already dating?) would be hilarious. I do not expect you to write as if you're transcribing a comic; regular prose is absolutely fine and in fact I'd prefer it.

Temeraire - Naomi Novik 
William Laurence, John Granby, Tenzing Tharkay

Look, I am a simple woman with simple needs and I would just like my OT3 to live happily ever after, perhaps while supporting Temeraire's various bids for elected government positions and preventing Iskierka from setting anything really important on fire. It would be truly excellent if they could also kiss. (I have nothing against Little and I don't want anything bad to happen to him! I just was real set on my Tharkay/Granby OTP already when Little/Granby became canon and I'm sticking to my guns so feel free to handwave their relationship or make them amicable exes.) As far as actual goings-on besides the kissing, I am open to all possibilities. Kidfic? Sure. Epistolary? Love it. Comedy of manners? Get your Austen on. Overthrowing the aristocracy? I'm sure Temeraire and Perscitia could manage it if they put their minds to it. I also love AUs of all stripes and adore many of the minor characters (especially Perscitia, Jane, Emily, Lady Allendale, Berkeley and Maximus, and Catherine and Lily). If you were feeling the holiday spirit, something like Tharkay's first time hosting a big Christmas shindig at his Fuck Off Racist Cousins estate would be a lovely opportunity to get everyone together! I read a ton of Regency romances so if you want to employ some time-honored plot points like Tharkay needing to be rescued from matchmaking Mamas I would laugh for days.

Chalion Saga - Lois McMaster Bujold 
Penric kin Jurald, Desdemona (Chalion), Nikys Khatai, Adelis Arisaydia

Ok first off I love Pen and Desdemona so much and I hope they live happily ever after forever and get married on the Astral Plane or whatever, every time Pen mentions that he's going to die and Des hints at how she's going to go screaming off the deep end out of grief my face involuntarily turns into a sadface emoticon. So if you’re not jamming with my Arisaydia and Nikys prompts it's totally cool to just write about Pen and Desdemona being adorable -- maybe Des teaching Pen something from her past lives or Pen giving Des presents. Speaking of Pen giving presents, however... it has always struck me that since Desdemona likes it when Pen's body has nice things and (most of) Desdemona likes good-looking guys, something that Pen might potentially give her is sex with a good-looking guy. Perhaps Arisaydia, who canonically thinks that Pen is a pretty hot lady when he's done up in drag? (Mira's Last Dance is a GIFT to us all.) Mostly I'm interested in the complicated dynamics that would arise from Pen and Des sharing a body but having different lovers, plus the potential weirdness of Nikys and Arisaydia sharing or not-sharing Penric. (The whole situation makes me think of a historical anecdote I read once about conjoined twins who married a pair of sisters.) I personally am fine with both incest and quasi-incest for this fandom and would also be delighted if you wanted to go straight to OT4 land! Nikys and Arisaydia's relationship to each other is so interesting, and uncomfortably intense sibling devotion is absolutely my jam. Nikys probably already has complicated feelings about the joint ownership of Pen's body, and I love her budding friendship with Desdemona, so if you're not down with Arisaydia getting involved, I'd also be interested in Des helping Pen convince Nikys to stay with them, or Des helping Nikys convince Pen to go with her. Lots of options!

Request 1 by Merfilly
Dragonriders of Pern - Anne McCaffrey 
Robinton (Dragonriders of Pern), Menolly (Dragonriders of Pern), Moreta (Dragonriders of Pern), Lessa (Dragonriders of Pern)

For this request, I am, perhaps obviously, not asking for all 4 characters to appear. (If you can, more power to you, given the separation of time periods.

For the Present Pass characters, I am looking for character exploration. Again, no need to work all three in. Though, given the implied interest of both women in the man, perhaps that could be an angle? However, I am asking to avoid the more shrewish aspects that appeared in both ladies later in the canon. I am a poly-shipper, so eyes-wide-open discussion of such things would be interesting. Please feel free to use other characters. Respect for the canon relationships is appreciated. Possible prompts: retirement, exploration, friendship, crisis, rising up.

Specific DNWs for Present Pass: minimal AIVAS presence, minimal to no Kylara presence, please. I prefer no Meron as well. 

Feel free to write AU to canon, and if you do, canon relationships can be waived, so long as F'lar nor Sebell nor Kasia nor Silvina are written in bad lights merely to move them away from their relationships. Side note to this: I ship Robinton/F'lon in their youth. Dragonrider Robinton AUs always welcome.

For Moreta: again, character exploration. Show me scenes of her life. I genuinely think that she and Sh'gall were not as poor in their relationship as the crisis of the Plague showed. I have no issue with her having previous relationships with B'lerion or D'say or Talpan. I ship her and Alessan deeply, and if you AU events to save her, prefer a poly relationship that includes Nerilka. NOT that I am asking for any of these extra characters, but no one exists in a vacuum. I typically headcanon Moreta as very heterosexual and heterosensual, but have no issues with exploring other directions, maybe with Kamiana even.

General DNWs on all of it: Deathfic for the sake of deathfic (canonical death embellishment okay). Rape. Dub-con because of dragons/firelizards is okay because it's canon. Smut is fine, but I'd prefer it focus on character interaction more than the sex.


Request 2 by Merfilly
Vampire Chronicles - Anne Rice 
Louis de Pointe du Lac (Vampire Chronicles - Rice), Claudia (Vampire Chronicles - Rice)

Other characters welcome as needed. What I really want is a story detailing either Claudia's life in New Orleans with Louis as the focal 'parent', or their journey abroad. AUs where Claudia survived welcome, but I prefer to see her cleverly work around her restrictions than to descend into madness.

Honestly, there are no DNWs for this fandom, just because I think they have explored so many bizarre dark corners of the psyche already.


Request 3 by Merfilly
Elfquest 
Strongbow (Elfquest), Dart (Elfquest), Clearbrook (Elfquest), Tyleet (Elfquest)

Any of the characters listed may be omitted as needed. 

DNW: deathfic, rape, non-con. Dub-con due to Recognition is canon and would be acceptable. 

OC elves or humans or wolves as needed to flesh the story out are okay. Other characters, as needed, also alright. Character exploration is something I am very big on in this series, as so much is from Cutter's perspective. Show me the events of canon, or hidden moments, through other eyes. Prompts: hunting, hiding, love, play, learning

Dear Yuletide Author,

Thanks for participating! I first want to emphasize that everything following this is optional, and that I would appreciate any gift that I receive. Please don't feel obligated to comply with any of the following suggestions.

I would prefer not to have a non-canonical setting AU (mostly against modern day, tbh) smut, or rape. I'm also not a big fan of ABO AUs. If I could ask for one thing, I would ask for something plotty with a side of conspiracy similar to canon, but again, feel free to ignore. If you're looking for a prompt, I'd love to see anything featuring Lin Shu/Mei Chang Su's mother or aunt or both since we get so little of them canonically. But again, don't feel pressured to do so!

Dear Yuletide Author,

Thanks for participating! I first want to emphasize that everything following this is optional, and that I would appreciate any gift that I receive. Please don't feel obligated to comply with any of the following suggestions.

One of my favorite things about the more recent half of Taichi's arc in the manga has always been about Suou's ability to see that Taichi does not implicity enjoy karuta. Taichi doesn't have the fiery passion that Chihaya and Arata have, hasn't played consistently from a young age like so many of the other giants in the karuta world canonically have. And I've always felt that this was a part of Taichi that Chihaya was always blind to because it was so hard for Chihaya to think that somebody could simply not love karuta. So I really loved that Taichi was able to address this issue with Suou and kind of grow from that. I also just love Suou \"teaching\" Taichi his cruel kind of karuta. Yet, I still dont really know how Taichi feels about Suou and vice versa? I'd love any kind of day-to-day, slice of life Taichi and Suou interaction. A quick splash of their friendship. Again, feel free to do something completely different if you would like to, I would enjoy anything I receive.

I would prefer a non AU, but anything else goes.

Rhy Maresh, Kell Maresh

Dear Yuletide Author,

Thanks for participating! I first want to emphasize that everything following this is optional, and that I would appreciate any gift that I receive. Please don't feel obligated to comply with any of the following suggestions.

Honestly, my favorite thing in this entire series is Kell and Rhy's sibling relationship. The push and pull of their individual insecurities and desires balanced with their surprisingly wholesome relationship where they genuinely care about each other's well being is just so full of possibilites and emotions. They're both so obviously imperfect, but love each other so fiercely. It's both so dangerously co-dependant, but also filled with somthing tantalizingly intimate. I'd love anything pre- or post- canon (or both!) centering on their relationship in any way (and this can include any of their relationships with other characters in canon). 

I would prefer a non AU, but anything else goes.

Maria Jones (The Box of Delights (TV))

Anything about Maria. Please. She's been expelled from several schools. Headmistresses swoon when they hear her name. She's generally got at least one pistol on her at all times. She faced down Abner Brown and Sylvia Daisy Pouncer and they let her go. Maria's exploits before or after the story would be fantastic. How did she get expelled? Ignoring the cop-out ending, what does Maria go on to do later now she's seen true villains and magic at work? Go ahead and include anyone else from the movie if you like. That ending has always bothered me, but the rest of it is marvelous. If you've read The Midnight Folk, you know that Kay has had prior dealings with Sylvia and Abner. What about Maria? Was this her first encounter with things like this? Her sisters seem like they'd be likely to brush it off, but Maria and Kay are far more drawn to it.

Basic DNWs: Non-con/dub-con/rape, pregnancy/mpreg, ABO, incest, non-canon character death, no smut in this one unless you're aging Maria up to adulthood please.

Pregnancy and kidfic are in my DNWs for other fandoms, but as the end of the movie involves Monday's twins, I'd be fine with them being in the story? I'd just prefer to not have a fic focused on, say, Thursday becoming pregnant, or around the twins post-movie.

I was so thrilled to see this get nominated because I've just played it for the first time. With the absence of any nominated characters, I'd say you are free to do whatever you want with this, whether you want to use the mediums/psychics the players represent, who are listed in the instructions, or the various unnamed suspects on the cards, or the family involved in the mystery. They're all such rich options. You could, if you have the game, deal out some cards and use them as inspiration. If you don't have a copy of the game, you could take a look at the cards online and come up with a possible story for it. I'd love to see something with the visions sent by the ghost coming into play with some of the bizarre art cards having meaning to a character.

I know there's been some lore released about the background of the island and all, and I would love to see that incorporated, but if you're not feeling that, make up your own! That's cool too. Want to follow one nameless (or named-by-you) character who drops onto the island and murders (or stealths) his/her way to a delicious chicken dinner? Awesome. Want to write about any mysterious powers-that-be who are overseeing this whole mess? Go for it. Want to address what the island was like before it was full of murder boys and girls? Cool by me.

Murder Most Unladylike Series - Robin Stevens 
Hazel Wong, Daisy Wells

Likes: AUs, plot, strong women, femslash, in character depictions, fantasy, plot, fluff, happy-endings (the non sexually explicit meaning), adventure, humor, science, domestic situations, werewolves or other beasts, slow builds in relationships.

Dislikes: Non-con, BDSM, domestic abuse, and character bashing. Situations where there’s a serious power imbalance between the characters—say student/teacher or boss/employee—tend to squick me as well because the more vulnerable person can’t easily say no. I’m not a huge fan of porn, though I’ll read it, as I’m more interested in the emotional payoff of the relationship. I tend to lose interest and my eyes sometimes glaze over a little during longer sex scenes.

Some possible suggestions for fic ideas include Daisy pining over Hazel, the ladies visiting Hong Kong, something about them being spies (Daisy would love that sort of work and obviously drag Hazel along), or maybe fic about them in college. Perhaps they could go traveling or they end up in a situation where Daisy has to follow Hazel’s lead. A mystery would be great, but coming up with a good one is difficult and there’s so much else about them and their relationship that needs exploring. I’d be equally happy with fic set during canon or an AU, modern seems easiest. First Class Murder was my favorite of the books so far in large part because I enjoyed Hazel’s father. I’d love if the fic explored more of Hazel’s back-story.

Likes: AUs, plot, strong women, femslash, in character depictions, fantasy, plot, fluff, happy-endings (the non sexually explicit meaning), adventure, humor, science, domestic situations, werewolves or other beasts, slow builds in relationships.

Dislikes: Non-con, BDSM, domestic abuse, and character bashing. Situations where there’s a serious power imbalance between the characters—say student/teacher or boss/employee—tend to squick me as well because the more vulnerable person can’t easily say no. I’m not a huge fan of porn, though I’ll read it, as I’m more interested in the emotional payoff of the relationship. I tend to lose interest and my eyes sometimes glaze over a little during longer sex scenes.

Possible prompts for Stella and Mo include the two of them cloud gazing or song writing, cooking something vegetarian (maybe a Banjaree family recipe?), or possibly going out on a date (dinner/movie, laser tag, swing dancing). Maybe Mo has to bail Stella out of jail after a protest. Or after Lemonade Mouth gets famous, they go on a tropical vacation to escape the paparazzi. As for potential AUs: werewolves or an arranged marriage?

Enchanted Forest Chronicles - Patricia Wrede 
Kazul (Enchanted Forest), Cimorene (Enchanted Forest)

Likes: plot, strong women, femslash, in character depictions, fantasy, plot, fluff, happy-endings (the non sexually explicit meaning), adventure, humor, science, domestic situations, werewolves or other beasts, slow builds in relationships.

Dislikes: Non-con, BDSM, domestic abuse, and character bashing. Situations where there’s a serious power imbalance between the characters—say student/teacher or boss/employee—tend to squick me as well because the more vulnerable person can’t easily say no. I’m not a huge fan of porn, though I’ll read it, as I’m more interested in the emotional payoff of the relationship. I tend to lose interest and my eyes sometimes glaze over a little during longer sex scenes.

I absolutely adored <i>Dealing with Dragons</i> and the way Cimorene ran away from home to find a much happier life with Kazul as a dragon’s princess. The later books where she finds romance and leaves the best job ever are fun, but I never identified with them the way I did with the first book. I would love fic set some time between Cimorene entering service and the events of <i>Searching for Dragons</i> when she’s still living with Kazul. Maybe the fic’s about Cimorene sorting through the new treasury and library after Kazul becomes king of the dragons or what it’s like making brief appearances at dragon court. Maybe Kazul is writing a book of her own specifically for dragons, such as <i>Managing and Maintaining Your Princess</i>, that’s comparing Cimorene to some of the past princesses she’s had. Or Kazul has to go settle some dragon dispute and brings Cimorene along. Maybe they go on a diplomatic mission/attend a wedding, either visiting foreign dragons or staying as guests in a human castle, and whacky hijacks ensure.

I would prefer this particular fandom stay in the original universe, or something similar to the original. I would also prefer Kazul stay a dragon, or at least not turn into a human, but it’s fine if the opposite happens to Cimorene. You can’t go wrong with more dragons in a story.

Bad Night (2015) 
Kate (Bad Night), Abby (Bad Night)

I saw this movie pop up in my recommendations on Netflix, and I fell in love with it based on the description alone. I am a huge sucker for female friendships and action heroines, and this movie just hit all of my buttons. I would love to see more about the continuing adventures of Kate and Abby, especially if those adventures involve more undercover police work and unintentional dealings with the crime world. While these two are amazing friends, I would not be opposed to seeing them in a romantic relationship.

The Space Between Us (2017) 
Tulsa (The Space Between Us), Gardner Elliot (The Space Between Us)

This movie manages to hit all my buttons for tropes that I love. The film leaves a lot of unanswered questions about where the characters will proceed moving forward. I would love to see more about the continuing adventures of Gardner and Tulsa after the film ends – I feel it's kind of inevitable that Tulsa will end up on Mars at some point. Alternatively, I think an epistolary story of them trying to make a long distance relationship work in the meantime, or telling each other stories (I can only imagine the The Martian level shenanigans that had to have happened with five astronauts and a baby and no supplies on the entire planet).

Nearlyweds (2013) 
Stella (Nearlyweds), Erin (Nearlyweds), Casey (Nearlyweds)

I love the interactions between the three women, and I love the fact that while most movies end with the characters getting married, this movie begins with it and is about making a relationship work. And while I really like the canon relationships between the women and their husbands (well, not Mark, but the others), I also would not have minded if the movie ended with the montage of the three of them living together, and if you want to write them as polyamorous lesbians instead of best friends forever, I would love that as well.

Tomb Raider (Video Game) 
Lara Croft, Samantha Nishimura

I never really played the Tomb Raider games before the 2013 release, and I just fell in love with this game when I did. It was so over the top in the best action movie way, that it was often hard to take it seriously when Lara just shrugged off mortal injury after mortal injury and kept pushing forward for the love of her life, I MEAN PLATONIC BEST FRIEND, Sam. I would love to see further adventures of the two after Yamatai, traveling the world and stopping various cults together, all while Lara is unearthing various relics and Sam is filming her doing so.

Further: there are so many amazing plot hooks in this show, whether it's during 1.0 or any one of Michael's restart efforts or in the latest attempt. I also really just love watching Eleanor and Chidi bounce off each other, and I do ship that as well, but I also just love Eleanor/Trying To Be A Better Person. And Eleanor/Chidi/Tahani in any permutation. And I love the total off-putting sunny weirdness of The Good Place, too. (Food puns! ALL OF THE FOOD PUNS!) How far the deception goes; is there a real Good Place out there somewhere? Does it look like the traditional depiction, or is it slightly twisted in the same way that we see flaming lava monsters and hear about grotesque physical torture but Michael's work is shown as a fairly ordinary office setting? Is there a way to get there beyond the train? None of this is coherent, I just love this show and I'm down for almost anything featuring one to three of these characters.

Carly Rae Jepsen (Carly Rae Jepsen RPF)

I love the meme of Carly being \"queen of music\" \"queen of love\" \"queen of black and white mime realness\" etc etc. I'd love to see something playing with that, whether it's exploring a literal thing she's been called queen of, or an AU where she's a historical/fantasy/scifi/princess diaries/whatever literal actual queen.

Something playing off the Run Away With Me could be fun, whether it's a second-person POV fic about traveling with Dream GF Carly or something from Carly's POV about what taking that trip was actually like.

I know there are no other nominated characters this year, but if you're interested in exploring something with an ensemble cast or even just a few side characters, I love most of your standard pop stars and indie artists (list of suggestions in letter) and would enjoy something that plays with that!

Kill the Boy Band - Goldy Moldavsky 

I love the relationship between the narrator and Erin so much. I'd love to hear more about that, reading it either as friendship/gen or as romantic. Something pre-canon about their friendship in Rupert fandom glory days would be great, or something post-canon about whether or not they ever reconcile would be good too. I'd love to hear about a possible reconciliation in their future, but I'd also love to read the sad bittersweet story of two girls who've been through way too much to truly trust each other anymore.

Boyband RPF is prone to wild tinhat theories, most notoriously in my opinion \"Louis has a fake baby.\" Are there crazy tinhat theories about the Ruperts?

I find Michelle Hornsbury a super fascinating character! I'd love to hear more about what it was actually like to date Rupert P. And who was she really, before dating Rupert? Post-book, does she really go to Dubai and date John Mayer??

Anything exploring Helena's darker side and/or her anticapitalist leanings is something I'm definitely super into.
Kaz's relationship with his aunt is also really interesting to me.

Poor Arthur Havisham - what a time he's had of it. Disinherited, heavily in debt, gay, bitter, and with a little bit of a drink problem. Living above a pub with the monstrous Meriwether Compeyson doesn't exactly help with any of that either.

This show basically came from my id. The way Compeyson menaces Arthur with his naked body, the way he tries to kiss him in public to frighten him, the beating with the belt - and just when Arthur can't take any more, he reels him back in with booze and false friendship and gently tending his wounds when Arthur gets violently mugged.

Please see letter for likes. DNW modern AUs or anything to do with pregnancy, birth, or babies. 

This book hurt my heart. The supernatural storyline aside (which I loved) it was Saul's struggle with his shame that really got to me. He'd internalised all his life that he was wrong inside somehow, and then he had that wonderful time of being in love before being betrayed in every way possible, branded a traitor and encouraged to kill himself. I mean FUUUUUCK. So watching Saul and Randolph find each other and trust each other was so lovely. Saul's vulnerability and Randolph's protectiveness were just the best. Plus the chemistry between them is off the charts ridiculous. I think that tree in the first chapter probably burst into flames not for any supernatural reason, but because Randolph and Saul were in each other's vicinity for the first time. Prompts are in my letter.

Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Roger Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Trish Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV))

i just want all the happy ot3 domesticity. doesn't have to be shippy, it can just be an exploration of how martin becomes an integral part of their family, or some trish&amp;martin bonding, or anything that includes found family feelings and healing and wanting to live again.
but do not hesitate to go full polyamory. maybe martin has to pretend to date roger for a case (or trish!) and one thing leads to another. maybe martin who thought he could never fall in love again realizes he has. maybe roger and trish decide to increase their efforts to make martin a part of their family to save him from himself and end up accidentally getting into a relationship with him. maybe at some point in the future martin is in a good place and has mostly recovered from his grief and trauma and everyone including himself is a bit puzzled he still isn't dating, except one day he looks at trish and roger and realizes he sort of already is in a relationship.
(bonus points in any case for martin being a part of trish's and their kids' lives and always being there for them)

Powerless (TV 2017) 
Emily Locke, Jackie (Powerless)

i loved the concept of the show and i enjoyed their dynamic /so much/. the emotionally distant cynic being reluctantly won over by the bubbly idealist!
i'd love something where emily determinedly keeps up her campaign of winning jackie's friendship and jackie realizes she's falling in love with her--really, anything (platonic or romantic) that involves jackie being prickly and only showing affection covertly while emily sees right through her would be wonderful.
or something involving jackie's new powers. does some supervillain eventually kidnap emily to try and make jackie do something for them? or some canon divergence where jackie already had her powers when they met and had sort of ended up being a vigilante and there are some identity issues shenanigans?
or anything playing with the potential of the show, with superheroes and supervillains and supercatastrophes in the background while these regular people are trying to live their regular lives.

Sagaen om Isfolket | Legend of the Ice People - Margit Sandemo 

DNW: Heavy kinks (bdsm, fisting, scat, animal play, bestiality etc.), size/daddy/age kink, rape, A/B/O, public humiliation, permanent genderswap, mpreg, kidfic.

Anything! Anyone! Everyone! I'm so fond of this book series there's literally nothing I wouldn't read about these characters. Apart from some space opera AU where they turn into wereowls or something equally cracktastic. If I could've nominated more than four, I would have, but I chose these four because they seem like characters who'd be interesting to write. But you're welcome to use anyone else you want. Even focus on them (if that's allowed in the rules.. not sure).

I'm a shipper, so you're always welcome to do pairings. My preference is usually m/m but with this family? Het (canon and otherwise) and even femslash are just as appreciated. As is gen! Really, it can be the plottiest thing you've ever done or the mundanest of the mundane one-scene introspection pieces, and I'd be equally happy.

Linde-Lou: Anything about his life, happy or sad. Or about him and Christa. I'm fine with deathfic for obvious reasons if your muse is of a sadder type. Really, a sad Linde-Lou or a happy Linde-Lou = happy me. I'm easy.

Marco: Would it surprise you if I said anything? :D His life really is something else. I'd be happy with any tiny bit you want to write about him, his life or his afterlife, though I'm slightly more interested in his doings in our world. For example, how was it like to be different people? Or something about him and Ulvar! I'd love that. Or bonding with mortals vs. immortals. (Btw, I'm not done with Ljusets Rike - I'm somewhere past half-way - but I know the basics, so I'm fine with a few hints if you must. Though I'd prefer Isfolket time line.) 

Targenor: I'm on my reread number I don't even know anymore, and I'm currently reading about Heike. He and his Wanderer friend are so special. ♥ I'd take anything with him, really. Go back to the time he still lived. How was it like? Or tell me about Heike's childhood and how they bonded with Targenor. What was it like for him before they met and his only connection to people were the locals who were afraid of him? Or go with the, uh, afterlife/not quite our world and give me a glimpse of how he's with the others there.

Tova Brink: Ah, how I relate to her and feel for her. I relate to her struggle with her self-image and self-esteem, and the worry that there's no one out there for her. I'd love to read anything, just like with the others. Any time of her life, from childhood to post-books, with anyone. And her sort of platonic flirting with Marco, aww. :D

Or if there's a story you've wanted to write, even when it doesn't quite fit what I've mentioned here, do that one!

The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) 
Athos (The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)), Philippe (The Man in the Iron Mask (1998))

DNW: Heavy kinks (bdsm, fisting, scat, animal play, bestiality etc.), size/daddy/age kink, rape, A/B/O, public humiliation, permanent genderswap, mpreg, kidfic.

I recently rewatched this after several years, and I still like it. I knew I'd have to nominate and request it, come Yuletide. :) It's hardly a historically accurate piece but I don't care.

First things first. Yes, I ship these two, I'm not gonna lie. But! The reason I like these two together is the fact that they need each other. One has lost a father he barely got to know, and one has lost a son. They're broken. The scene with \"Let me love you like a son to a father.\" pretty much covers it all. So it's perfectly fine to view them as totally 100% platonic. Maybe have them interested in other people, or leave romance out of it completely.

Any glimpse at their life post-movie would be lovely, gen or shippy or something in between. Or something about how Athos taught him to be Louis (there must've been more than what we saw). Does Philippe have nightmares about his imprisonment?

Only thing I wish for you to avoid is in my DNWs. As much as they are like father and son (or found-father and found-son, rather), I don't want the shippiness to come across as Philippe having daddy issues, or the age difference being a huge kink for either one of them. Them acknowledging it's a bit questionable is perfectly fine, even expected.

But like I said, it can be the most gen piece you can imagine, and I'll be happy. Feel free to add other people as needed. Maybe less Porthos and his naked women, though. :D

A Beautiful Mind (2001) 
Charles Herman, John Nash (A Beautiful Mind)

DNW: Heavy kinks (bdsm, fisting, scat, animal play, bestiality etc.), size/daddy/age kink, rape, A/B/O, public humiliation, permanent genderswap, mpreg, kidfic.

It's been a while since I last saw ABM, but something reminded me about it and I felt like I had to nominate and request it. There's really not much fic out there. I know the whole mental health issue can be a little intimidating. And maybe people are put off by the fact that this is sort of RPF. Personally I see this as more FPF. So, if we matched on this, yay!

I ship it, but you don't have to. What I find most interesting about them is that out of everyone John could have imagined, he chose Charles. Why is that? What else happened between them that wasn't covered in the movie? Post-movie? Feel free to add Alicia or whoever you feel the story needs to have there.

It doesn't matter if you're not an expert on mental disorders - I'm hardly an expert myself - and it's ok if you just handwave bits here and there.

Dark Matter (TV) 
Anders (Dark Matter), Kyle Kierken, One | Derrick Moss, Three | Marcus Boone

DNW: Heavy kinks (bdsm, fisting, scat, animal play, bestiality etc.), size/daddy/age kink, rape, A/B/O, public humiliation, permanent genderswap, mpreg, kidfic.

You don't have to include everyone! Just one or two is enough. (Pun not intended. :D)

I'm stuck mid-S3, but I'll be done with the whole season by reveals, so don't fear dropping spoilers. It also explains why my comments might look off or somehow lacking. It's because I don't know the whole story yet. But! This show! Omg! I'm gutted S3 is all we're going to get. I love this world. ♥ These people and the ship and the worldbuilding and all of it. So I'd be happy with anything you want to write.

I chose a few characters, and it's funny (to me, anyway) that they all share a common denominator: Three. As in I ship Three with every single one of them. :D But that's because I ship Three with just about everyone. You can probably tell why. It's just how he is. But I'm fine if you don't do slash and only prefer gen stuff. Friendshippy bonding is equally loved. Or, you know, them just hanging out and/or hunting each other like mortal enemies. Any interaction is good, even antagonistic. :D

These are snagged and remixed from my earlier prompts:

Three: I love him. Period. He and Two are my favourites and I doubt anything during the latter half of S3 can change that. I love how he can be a combination of a clueless oaf and an efficient fighter <i>and</i> someone who's filled with bottled emotions and a huge heart. He's the kind of guy you want on your side, because he'll take care of you (unless he's jailed or shot or otherwise tied up) and be your loyal friend and entertain you with dumb jokes (intentionally or un, depending) and so much more. And he's super easy on the eye. :D I ship him with these three but also Four and Six, and he and Five are friends for life.

Anders: We don't get to know much about him, which just makes me want to know more. Anything focusing on his life would be lovely. I wouldn't mind if it included something shippy with Six, but it's completely optional. And since the beginning of S3? Anders/Three! Canon divergence! Something!

One: I like the guy! I like that not every male in the crew is an alpha macho gun-wielding butchfest. We need the pretty ones, too! And he <i>can</i> handle a weapon, so all's good. :)

With One and Three? All the snark, all the banter, all the reluctant affection against their better judgment! I miss the chemistry between these two. The dislike and mistrust and competition, the friendship that comes from being in the same situation. I'd like anything that plays off their differences and similarities. Getting into trouble together, blaming each other and ending up with bruises but still thinking the other guy isn't so bad. This can take place before S1 began when they were Marcus and Derrick, or they can be One and Three before One got killed, or you can bring One back somehow and make it a big reunion fight and love fest. :D World-hopping between alternate timelines is always welcome, and with this one it wouldn't even be completely uncanonical.

Kierken: Ah, poor Kierken and his manhunt. What happens when he finally catches Three, or does he? Do they just hook up for one time as a part of Three's plot to free himself or could there be more? Or give me Three's POV. Give me him teasing Kierken with his escapes and loving every moment of it. Or just give me Kierken on his own, a day in his life, or a mission that has nothing to do with Raza. One that failed, one that he totally owned, anything. What's it like to be Kierken and how much does he enjoy the chase, as slippery as his targets may be?

I also like the idea of more worldbuilding featuring any of these characters. I loved the sci-fi feel of S2 and my favourite episodes were those where we got glimpses of what else is out there, the new places and new tech and new people they met. And time jumps are always close to my heart. But also, and this is not the least even when it's the last, I love all sorts of bonding between them. Any of them.

Other people I love: The, uh, whole cast? Ok, like I said already, especially Two. ♥ But also Five and the Android, and Four before he became Ryo again. Though I'm starting to almost see Ryo's POV, as scary as it is. I'm not super into Sarah, so maybe keep her to a minimum if you must include her? Other minor characters (like Truffault or Teku) are also welcome, if you can fit them somewhere.

Hut 33 
Gordon (Hut 33)

DNW: Heavy kinks (bdsm, fisting, scat, animal play, bestiality etc.), size/daddy/age kink, rape, A/B/O, public humiliation, permanent genderswap, mpreg, kidfic.

This show! ♥ To be honest, I could've picked Any, and that could've even included any of the cast <i>or</i> the guests, and I would've been happy with anything I got. But I chose Gordon because I feel he doesn't get to shine as much as Minka with her murdery tendencies or Archie and Charles with the never-ending working class vs. snobbery fights. Josh wasn't in the tag set, but I would've loved to have him there as well. Or Winstanley! As it is, I'm going with Gordon.

I like the comedy style of the show, but lately I've been more and more intrigued by the idea of a fic that doesn't follow the style or format of the original. Something that's maybe less comical and more serious? But I adore the comedy-style so if you're even a tiny bit worried about style, don't be! Do comedy! Do a missing episode! A missing scene! Anything! I love the subtle and not so subtle references to historical people, events and even gadgets, but I'd be equally happy if there were none. As long as it's Gordon, I'm happy. :)

I'd love to read about his life outside the episodes. Maybe a missing scene? Something he references - like the time ladies wanted to buy his services and he was completely clueless - but maybe in a \"this is how it happened\" kind of way. Or his life after Hut 33's events, during war or post-war or even when he's in his 20s. Does he have any friends outside the co-workers and how does he interact with them? Did he learn to wear real trousers and did he celebrate it? Does he ever learn how to date (either men or women, I'm not picky)?

If you have an idea for something else, go with that instead. I'm not very hard to please with this fandom. :) Even if the whole cast is there, as long as Gordon's featured in a role that's more than tapestry (unless it's Minka teaching him how to look like tapestry) I'll be happy.

I've only seen this movie once so far, but I intend to see it again (and again) at some point. Still, I came out of the theatre wanting these two to have their own story line, so of course I had to request it. :D

Honestly, anything with them bonding would be lovely. I ship them (can be unrequited if you want it that way, though ouch my heart, but hurting's good sometimes) but it's fine if you just see them as friends. I also like Mason so the canon het's fine as a background setting.

I don't really have any useful prompts for you, sorry. Mostly because I'm easy and will happily accept just about anything you want to write. :)

Look, I spent high school way, way too into Tennessee Williams plays. My friends and I would spend lunch break hanging out in this weird little outdoor space and doing over-the-top readings of them. I'm not sure I can actual explain why we were doing it, or why it amused us to no end, but hey, watching this recaptured that feeling.

Frog Music - Emma Donoghue 
Jenny Bonnet, Blanche Beunon

Who was Jenny before she was Jenny?  What if she'd managed to stay alive, stay with Blanche - would they have run off with Petit and made a life together?  

How did Blanche discover her talent for the stage?  Who is she at forty, fifty, sixty?  Does her vow to reform at the end of the book stick with her?

Brave (2012) 
Fergus (Disney: Brave), Elinor (Disney: Brave), Merida (Disney: Brave)

Elinor's youth - her life pre-marriage.  What drew her so strongly to duty?

Scenes from Elinor and Fergus' courtship!  Any obstacles or hazards they had to face as they grew together.  Did he have to learn courtly manners to charm her?  Did she see right through them?

Fergus and how he manages his own politics - as a youth, and as a man.

Fresh adventures for Merida and her mother - or Merida in the future, in a nurturing position of her own, looking back and shaking her head at herself.

More adventures with all three of them, or more of Merida as a young kid!

Emperor's New Groove (2000) 
Yzma (Disney), Kronk's Shoulder Devil, Kronk's Shoulder Angel, Kronk (Disney)

Other times Kronk's angels have been helpful - or unhelpful!

The movie hinted that the shoulder angels have an active social and leisure life.  What do those two do when Kronk doesn't need them?

What was Yzma like when she was young?  She was young of course, once.  What did she do? And what's her life like post-movie, now that she's a cat?

I love Kronk when he strives to do right, even if he doesn't understand what 'right' is sometimes.  Show me him doing good, or getting super enthusiastic about something small and intricate and silly!

The Breakfast Club (1985) 
Brian Johnson (Breakfast Club), John Bender

Hi! I've totally exhausted the Breakfast Club fanfics out there and have been looking forward to Yuletide because the Breakfast Club is usually in there!
It was nice that Brian and Bender are the only character options (well, for me anyway) because honestly who are we kidding.
I was thinking it would be awesome to have canon setting/era- I mean having them be older and therefor in the future would be totally cool, but I would probably prefer not to have a modern highschool au. I'm okay with serious or light, all ratings, etc. I'm a sucker for actions speaking louder than words, awkwardness, hurt/comfort or angst with a happy ending... I just think these two characters are adorable/really interesting together. Probably not like crack either. I really like stories when they're taken seriously as complex characters and together.
In some fics it's a focal point that Bender's been abused and I'd rather it not be a main point or something that's dwelled on much if you choose to go that route. Also just to be thorough no noncon, or torture. Other stuff like general teen angst, Brian's canon-typical suicidal ideation, etc., is all okay.

Vikings (TV)

I really love Athelstan and Ragnar on Vikings and miss them terribly. I love their dynamic of slowly forming a relationship despite their differences and without many words- again, I love the actions-louder-than-words thing played out in fic. I'm really open to whatever genre you'd like to take this to- heck, even a modern au would be a-ok for me. I just would rather no deathfic please. Would prefer slash but preslash or more gen is okay too. If you want to include Lagetha that's fine, I'd just rather have her not be a focal point. Any rating is fine.

Dear Evan Hansen - Pasek & Paul/Levenson 
Connor Murphy (Dear Evan Hansen)

I loved the musical and now I'm really interested in seeing more Connor! Alive-Connor, that is. The bits and pieces we get of Connor are so intriguing I would seriously love to just sort of delve into him as a person/character. (also Mike Faist is so goddamn cute jfc. if you manage to get Connor in a messy bun at some point during the story I wouldn't have any objections)
I'm okay with pretty much wherever you'd want to take it, whether it's gen or tree-bros or something. I have a preference for slash but am super open. Other than that, I just would love some Connor-centric..... something! Um, probably would prefer not crack, but other than that I'm okay with however dark/light you want to take it. Although I guess also I would prefer no torture, non-con, or abuse (drug abuse etc. is fair game, I'm talking about physical abuse).
Thanks lots!!!

Give me Han being a badass, cold-hearted, hot-tempered assassin with a thing about people stealing his plane. If you're in the mood for something shippy, I'd love to see him (grudgingly and/or enthusiastically) get up, close and personal with Victoria, Frank &amp; Sarah, or any other character(s) you feel inclined to ship him with. If gen is more your cup of tea, I'd love something about his career as a contract killer - 5 times he killed someone with a piece of paper? Taking out an ad and setting up job interviews for his PAs? I'd rather not get anything focused on his career as a spy and/or his subsequent imprisonment after Frank framed him.

The Quantocks Quartet - Ruth Elwin Harris 
Julia Purcell

Please see my letter for prompts and more details! A brief summary:

I would love to see any exploration of Julia's life, particularly during her time in France or after Geoffrey's death. I'm not so interested in her relationship with her eventual husband, but if you want to write something that spans her whole life then of course feel free to include him and her children! I always found her relationship with both Geoffrey and Gabriel fascinating (I have to admit, Gabriel was my first literary crush!), as well as her relationship with Frances and Gwen, so anything that focuses on any of those would be awesome. 

General likes:
- casefic
- plot-focused stories
- before/after the canon stories
- alternative endings/au diversions
- time travel/time loops
- fix it fic
- canon ships/friendships and friendship fic
- UST
- realisations of desire or romantic explorations, explorations of characters realising they're 'more than friends'
- hurt/comfort (overcoming ailments to come out on top, painful confessions, stronger/leader character needing to be helped)
- everyone thinks a friend is dead but then they're not
- crossovers (between the fandoms I've requested, or with any of: Buffy, Firefly, LotR, Stargate SG:1, Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: DS9, Star Wars episode I-III, Discworld (City Watch), Persona 3, 4, or 5)
- dark!fic (permanent injuries mentally/physically, torture, Stockholm syndrome, dystopias, violence... ideally paired with hurt/comfort or with a not-completely-sad ending (ie bittersweet or happy ending rather than 'everything's still terrible'!). Feel free to go as dark as you want!
- long stories (I'm not one of those people who only reads short fics - I happily read everything from drabbles to 100k+ epics, so whatever length works for you, works for me!)

DNWS:
- miscommunications leading to awkwardness (I get major embarrassment squick from this, it’s just not a trope I enjoy!),
- character bashing
- jealousy as a major component of the story
- OT3 or OT4 fic focusing solely or primarily on domestic life/arrangements
- surprise!ships (i.e. non-canon ships/friendships/enemies in a story with no justification, explanation or background - non-canon ships are generally fine if they have some exposition or explanation though!)
- fluff!fic (ie, a little fluff is fine, especially in a happy ending, but if the fic is fluff throughout with no darker elements I would be a little disappointed!)
- sex scenes/porn as a major focus in the story (long sex scenes are just not my cup of tea)

Poirot - Agatha Christie 
Hercule Poirot (Poirot), Arthur Hastings (Poirot)

Please see my letter for prompts and more details! A brief summary:

For this fandom, I would love case!fic (or scenes from a larger plot would be wonderful too!). Alongside that, I would love to see the friendship between Poirot and Hastings - how they work together to solve the mystery, with their disagreements but ultimate appreciation for each other. I'd prefer gen here, or at least not romance if you do ship Poirot/Hastings (I don't mind fic that can be read either way, or in which they're clearly life partners but the focus isn't on romance or that aspect of their relationship). I also would prefer fic set during the 'golden era' of Poirot (circa Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile etc), rather than at the end of his life. Alternatively, an exploration of his backstory would be interesting, during his years in Belgium (perhaps involving his and Hastings' first meeting).

The Banner Saga (Video Games) 
Alette (The Banner Saga), Ekkill (The Banner Saga)

In the first Banner Saga, if you bring along Ekkill (like you probably did, the first time you played the game, little suspecting what lay down the road), he is revealed in Chapter 4 to be developing a delicate connection with Alette (to the deep horror of Rook). I would love to know more about that connection -- their disturbing conversations, their tentative camaraderie, their mutual habits of passivity and evasion -- in the context of the caravan. Is Ekkill developing a crush on Alette? Is Alette rethinking some parts of her worldview, thanks to Ekkill? Do they have any common reactions to this weird apocalypse that's slowly unfolding around them? Do they share any adventures? How do they react to the events of the story? What happens between them after Onef's mutiny? Why does Ekkill ultimately leave the caravan to join the Ravens? What, exactly, is their *deal*?

Maybe something from after the end of the movie -- how do the two of them juggle their professional and personal lives? What kind of work-life balance do they achieve, and how do they argue about it? Or maybe something from before the start of the movie -- how do Andrew and Margaret function as a team, even when they're deeply annoyed with one another? How much of Andrew's care-taking and nurturing is a result of his unconscious feelings about Margaret? How much of Margaret's persona is a result of her (irritating, inconvenient, and impossible) attraction to Andrew?

Atomic Blonde (2017)

There's a middle section of the movie, when Lorraine and Percival are working together but suspiciously circling one another, when Lorraine is still and cold and implacable and Percival is manic and combustible and relentless, in which I found their partnership exciting and alarming and fun. 

So: I'd like more of them, please, together in the same frame. Maybe it's a scene from the middle of the movie, when they're smiling at one another while planning all their elaborate double- and triple-crosses.  Maybe it's an AU fix-it: one of them makes slightly better life choices (or maybe the other makes slightly worse life choices), and they both make it out of Berlin a little less murderously inclined toward one another.  Or maybe one of them is a ghost haunting the other, who remains steadfastly indifferent to past trauma or spectral apparitions.

Final Fantasy VI 
Terra Branford (FF VI), Edgar Roni Figaro (FFVI)

Terra is my favorite character from this game -- I love her persona of dreamy menace, of soft-spoken and inadvertent violence, and her personal quest toward self-control and independence. I also love Edgar, who is witty and dashing and flippant and helplessly responsible, despite himself, like an accidental Prince Hal.

Thus I would particularly love a story about Terra and Edgar, and I would particularly love a love story, although I am deeply flexible on what constitutes a \"love\" story -- I am a sucker for sweeping passion, quiet domesticity, unrequited angst, platonic-buddy comedy, bloody tragedy, happy endings, sad endings, and bittersweet endings.

Madam Secretary 
Elizabeth McCord, Nadine Tolliver, Russell Jackson, Blake Moran

First of all, please note that I'm not expecting you to include all my requested characters, although I would like Elizabeth McCord herself to be in the story.

One of the things I love most about this show is the workplace relationships it depicts. I'm fascinated by the show's exploration of the kind of workplace intimacy that comes of high-stakes work, and I'd love to see more of that. I've frequently said to myself that I would watch a whole episode of Elizabeth and Russell Jackson locked in a room yelling at each other; alternatively, I'd love to see more of the friendlier side of Elizabeth and Russell's prickly relationship. I'd also be interested in backstory on Blake Moran and how he ended up working for Elizabeth, or something exploring Elizabeth and Nadine Tolliver's relationship - or Nadine being awesome and saving the day! Finally, if you want to write an ensemble piece, I'd also take any or all of these characters at work, saving the world (or not), or maybe just doing annoying paperwork and complaining about the office coffee. I unironically love this show despite all the American hegemony and American exceptionalism (I'm not American), and all I really want is workplace fic for it!

William Monk Series - Anne Perry 
William Monk (William Monk), Hester Latterly (William Monk), Oliver Rathbone (William Monk)

Although I imagine it would horrify Anne Perry, I personally feel that she has created the perfect setup for a William Monk/Hester Latterly/Oliver Rathbone threesome. This especially goes for the books Execution Dock, Acceptable Loss, A Sunless Sea, and Blind Justice, in which Rathbone's marriage crumbles, and he destroys his career. I'd love to see an exploration of the relationship between the three characters during this period - anything from something exploring their charged friendship to the formation or existence of a sexual relationship between them. Alternatively, I'd also be happy to receive something focused on either the relationship between Monk and Rathbone or the relationship between Hester and Rathbone at any point in the series - and again, that could be friendship-focused (or, in the case of Monk and Rathbone, something dealing with their friendship/partnership/rivalry), or involve sexual relationships, or anything in between. I ship all these characters in pretty much every combination, so go to town, and by all means introduce arguably anachronistic moral values at will, in keeping with the spirit of the canon!

I've included all four characters that were nominated in this fandom this year, but I'd be happy to receive fic focused on any one or more of the characters, so no need to include them all if you don't want to. I'm always happy to receive stories exploring the friendship between Cadfael and Hugh Beringar, whether that means them sitting in Cadfael's herb garden or riding out together to fight crime! Alternatively, I'd be interested to receive a story with Sister Magdalen and Aline Beringer as the female equivalents of Cadfael and Hugh - maybe as friends, maybe fighting crime, maybe just as two elite women wielding power and making their way in a patriarchal world. How would their lives be different from Hugh and Cadfael's? What might bring together a woman in a leadership role like Sister Magdalen and a noblewoman like Aline Beringer? Or how might Cadfael and Sister Magdalen team up to fight crime? Or, for that matter, how might Hugh and Aline Beringar?

Pod Save America (RPF) 
Jon Lovett (Pod Save America RPF), Tommy Vietor (Pod Save America RPF)

2017, or: The Year Podcast Hosts Broke Me. Does anyone love Jon Lovett like Tommy and Favs love Jon Lovett? Dear Lord. I got into this fandom because my wife repeatedly showed me things people had tagged #lovett and went IT YOU and then I listened to these smart smart idiots interact and then the surface was scratched and like HOLY CODEPENDENCY, BATMAN. I love everything about all of that. This fandom is so full of intimate vulnerabilities, which is frankly my favourite thing of all the things - they all know each other so well, and have known each other under such stressful intense circumstances and literally moved across the country for each other, and have been there for each other's best and worst moments, and started this company together out of a shared fear and guilt and hope and drive and determination, and frankly it all just k i l l s me. I love Jon Lovett's deep-held optimism and hope in people all wrapped up in this prickly hedgehog of a man, I love that they all love dogs, I love that Tommy looks like a WASP and is the biggest actual dick when pushed. I love Lovett's feelings about SILENCE DURING GAME OF THRONES, I love that he and Emily are bffs, I love their weird smart codependent wrapped up lives, I love the way they love and support and lovingly neg each other. PUNDIT IS AN ANGEL. END OF AD.

Society of Gentlemen - K. J. Charles 
Julius Norreys, Dominic Frey, Silas Mason

Seditious Affair is the most romantic book in the world, wowww. Two people compromising and making difficult decisions to make their lives fit together! The whole SoG cast fills me with an indecent amount of found family emotions. I love that Silas and Dominic mean to stay away from each other when they learn who they are and... can't, because it's been a year and they've been in love before they've known each other's names. I love the way they trust each other. I love how Dominic goes frantically looking for Silas post-fire but can honestly say that if Silas didn't want to see him, if he knew Silas was unhurt, he would let him be. \"They burned my books, Dom.\" Fucking hell. A comb and two cravats. I love that Silas is scared what he would say if Dominic asked him to give up his beliefs, and that's why Dominic would never ask him. Dominic's werewolf. I love the way they make their lives work together, and the way they are together, and the books they read together, and the way they argue and fuck and love. Dominic putting the Christmas thing together for Silas is so achingly thoughtful it makes me want to fall over. I love that Dominic trusts Silas to know what he needs, and that Silas helps Dominic see there's nothing wrong with it. I might love that the most.

ADDITIONALLY if you are here for Julius Norreys, he (like Milord from Prosperity) is an example of my favourite dude character type. Cold, composed blondes with a terror of and need for intimacy. I could read forever and ever about Julius shuttering himself away, locking everything back, and Harry irrepressibly and cheerfully holding him and bringing him back. The way Julius thinks about certain types of sex because they're too intimate and they frighten him is one of my favourite things. And then when he goes in, he's all in - he gives Harry something of his brother's; he buys Harry an earring; he runs OUT INTO THE STREETS IN A DRESSING GOWN FOR HIM. Julius Norreys breaks and makes my heart.

Prosperity Series - Alexis Hall 
Milord (Prosperity Series)

I love that Prosperity is about found family in the weirdest of ways. Most of all, I love Milord, every angry snarling \"that wasn't necessary\" part of him. Cruel-faced blondes are my biggest fictional dude weakness to begin with and then, like, Milord is essentially the embodiment of my favourite character type. I love that it makes him angry to love Ruben, because it's a weakness and because it isn't necessary. He thinks about love as something that can ruin you and still loves Ruben. He shoots Ruben so he can go after the other ship, which might be my favourite moment of the whole book, if it weren't for the scene Piccadilly watches. Milord on his knees, undone for Ruben. I want to read anything about Milord making the choice to do anything that's necessary, and the ways he goes against that - he didn't leap off the ship to save people! Ruben knows and wants him anyway! Milord wants Ruben, actually wants him for himself and not for any advantage or reason or logic, wants to get on his knees for him and also make him happy and hates when that goes against something else he wants and he STILL WANTS RUBEN. God. The way he obsessively cleans his hands. GOD. Also, he doesn't die in the book and so I will firmly pretend that is never going to happen, cool cool cool.

What do he and Ruben do post-Prosperity? What happened the second time Ruben finds him, pre-book, weak and coughing in a basement? When's the first time Milord lets Ruben see something vulnerable when they're not literally locked in a prison cell together?

I really love me some OG Nightwings. Anything about their travels together prior to the game would be amazing. Maybe a story about one of the Rites they might have faced together, prior to it all going wrong. Volfred/Oralech is my strong preference, but gen is fine, too.

House War - Michelle West 
Teller ATerafin, Finch ATerafin, Carver ATerafin, Angel (House War)

As you can probably guess from these characters, I'm looking for fic about Jewel's den.  I'm particularly interested in what happens during the 15 year timeskip between the first 3 books of House War and the events of The Sun Sword; we have a few hints, but that's it.  How do they adjust to being part of House Terafin?  Do they ever really fit in with anyone else?  Finch and Teller have jobs, at least, but Carver does not - what does he do with his time?  We know he liked hanging out with the servants, but he wasn't one himself, so is that really all he does? How does Angel make living in the House without taking the name or having an obvious purpose there work?  We know Jewel has sometimes traveled for House business and taken some of them with her - you could tell me about one of those trips.

I'm also interested in their relationships with each other.  Jewel might be the sun they all orbit, but surely that doesn't mean there aren't friendships and maybe even rivalries between the rest of them.  How do they relate to each other when Jewel isn't there?  What do they do while she's busy?  Do they have projects or hobbies of their own?

You don't have to include all 4 characters if you don't want to and you are also welcome to include the members of the den I didn't have room to nominate.

Namesake (Webcomic) 
Alice Purcell, Selva Chopper

I really ship these two; I would love shippy fic for them.  Something like \"five dates that got interrupted by Calliope emergencies and one that didn't\" or something cute about the difficulties of a relationship where one person turns random objects into shoes when stressed could be fun.  Or maybe Cheshire matchmaking or just interference?  (I love the Cheshires.)  Or you could do something heavier - both of these women have some seriously dark bits of their past, so hurt/comfort could easily work.  Or of course I always love porn.

I'd also be interested in fic about either one of them on their own.  How is Selva fitting in on Earth?  We see a lot more of Warrick - understandably, but it makes me curious about his sister.  What is she doing?  What does she think of Earth and Calliope?  What is she doing in her spare time?  Or tell me her side of their childhood: what was Selva doing while Warrick was becoming the Wicked Witch of the West?  How did she feel about what was going on?

Or Alice, I'd love to know more about her time in Wonderland.  Somehow I can't imagine the story of an Alice with a Cheshire cat soul was the same as usual.  What is Wonderland like now?  How have the Alices changed it or how has it changed over time?  What was Alice's time with Calliope like before our story begins?  We've seen a few bits and pieces, but I'd love to see more.

The Secret World 
Emma Smith (The Secret World), Hayden Montag, Annabel Usher, Sandy “Moose” Jansen

I'll start by saying you do not have to include all of these characters in your fic.

With Montag and Usher, I love their interactions during the Innsmouth Academy quests and I'd love to see more of them.  What else are they doing while the bees are working?  What was the school like before this happened?  What was the daily life of a teacher at Innsmouth Academy?  Do the faculty live on campus, or in town?

I don't get the idea they necessarily interacted much previously, but something like a fic about a faculty meeting, a chance encounter in town, or maybe something about the first time Annabel met Montag could be interesting, too.  Also, there's that reference from the Orochi to their \"back-up candidate in New England\" who I assume is supposed to be Carter - do the Orochi also have some sort of ties to the school?  Would the Illuminati have really shared or given them Carter, or are they just assuming they could take her by force?

I'm always very curious about Emma.  Was that house that burned really hers?  Was she even actually born in the normal way?  How did she end up with Orochi after the fire?  If they do have ties to the school, did they ever consider sending her there or did the Illuminati at least try to take her instead?  An AU where she did attend the Academy could be interesting, too.

I do ship Moose and Andy, but I've also always been intrigued by all the things he says about his background.  He's not a bee, so how did he come by his knowledge of the occult?  Is it really just a product of taking to the road?  What other occult disasters has he been through?  What really happened that time in New Orleans?  Or he mentions all the factions have tried to recruit him - how did that go?  (I assume it wasn't the same as the ones we see, given the difference circumstances.)

Sleepless Domain (Webcomic) 
Kokoro (Sleepless Domain), Undine (Sleepless Domain)

I do ship these two and this is another one where a first times fic could be really cute - first time they held hands, first date, first kiss, even just first realization of feeling something more.  Future fic could be interesting, too - what is their relationship like once they're no longer magical girls?

I'm also fascinated by this world and would love to see more of it explored.  What is the home life of either or both of these girls like?  Do parents ever not want their daughter to be a magical girl?  Were Undine's parents really ok with her going back out after what happened to her team?  What was it like at normal school when girls began having dreams and becoming magical girls?  Is the transition to being a magical girl a difficult one?  Why did Kokoro decide to fight on her own rather than joining a team?

I'd be fine with a darker fic, too.  How much have people in this city really forgotten?  We know the girls forget part of their dreams and Undine does not remember why someone could hate her, so loss of memory seems a real theme here.  Is there something about the city that causes it?  How often do magical girls die or become seriously injured?  Are the monsters always successfully contained by magical girls, or do people just forget if they go on rampages before they are stopped?

I know anything written about the world may well be jossed sooner or later, but I don't mind.

Drive Angry (2011) 
John Milton (Drive Angry), The Accountant (Drive Angry)

This B-movie is simultaneously <i>completely over the top</i> and absurdly nonchalant about its plot and the things it expects you to take in its stride. I love that John Milton gets more and more blasé and deadpan the more ridiculous his activities are, from a mid-coitus gunfight to trying to stop the end of the world with... a car.

I also love The Accountant: his complete lack of concern for human propriety combined with flashes of empathy and immense curiosity. I love that he has fun on the job.

And he and John have <i>immense</i> chemistry. Please, please, take the Accountant's curiosity in a natural direction. Or maybe John tries to seduce his way out of Hell. Or they have to work together and their differences only add to the sexual tension. 

Despite all the above, this is actually an or request! You do not have to include both characters if you don't want to. I am really curious to see John's life explored, not just his afterlife. What happened? How did he get the gun and get out of Hell? What made him the kind of person who could do that? Serious, ridiculous, either way. And the Accountant, TELL ME ABOUT HIM. Tell me about a previous assignment. Tell me about his conversations with the Devil, a 'quiet man actually, thoughtful ... well read'. What does he do when not chasing escaped sinners? (Surely they don't escape very often...)

Pegasus - Robin McKinley 
Ebon, Sylvi (Pegasus)

I love Ebon and Sylvi's close partnership, how each of them thinks the other is the best thing ever, and how excited each is to show the other their world.  Include romance or don't, include sexual feelings or don't, just please keep the emphasis on how important each is to the other. I could really go for one of them saving the other from peril. Or write me Sylvi and Ebon working on a normal activity together and using different respective skills. I love the cosy aspects of the worldbuilding - skyholds and dams and fine pegasus paper. More please. 

Obviously fix-it for the end of the book is welcome, but I'd also be interested in seeing how Ebon and Sylvi grow and change if they have to spend a long time apart.

I'm also fascinated by the weird comedy of manners whereby the human culture is smothered in meaningless ritual, and yet there's a dark core to it where maybe it really is protecting them from something. What's really going on? TELL ME. Tell me whether rocs really come from another world and why pegasi and humans are Inherently Inimical. What's the real story with Fthoom?

And if you want to sideline Sylvi and Ebon entirely, I'm interested in any of the following: Minial and what it's like to be a Speaker; Redfora and Oraan; Erisika; a similar historical minor character. I'd love it if you used a minor character to expand the hints we get about the history and world.

TELEPATHS IN LOVE. Wow I love these two together. I love how strong-willed they both are, and yet how each of them can change his or her mind and concede to the other. I love how clearly they realise that each has skills they can use. 

Would love to see them working together; would love to see Margo develop her powers; would love days in the life. I get a sense from the movie of Margo as a <i>character</i>, how she thinks and reacts, but what does she <i>do</i> all day?

Optionally, would also love Shiwan Khan to be a part of the story. Because the Shiwan/Lamont chemistry was through the roof. How about Shiwan <i>does</i> convince Lamont to rule the world with him, and Margo, part of a Resistance, believes that she can seduce Lamont back to the light?

Overall this is a great canon for darker fic or fic that explores the ethical underbelly of vigilantism. Lamont can control minds. When is he most tempted to abuse that? And on the lighter side of dark, does he ever try to make amends in Tibet, or only through his actions in New York?

Simoun (Anime) 
Dominuura (Simoun), Paraietta (Simoun)

Just one of these two characters is fine! I picked the two who interest me most as individual characters and as ways into the world of Simulacrum.

Paraietta so often is placed in the position of holding everyone else together  - though her own feelings are obviously so messy. I'd love a story of what life was like for her in Choir Tempest before the catastrophe at the start of the series. I'd also love more exploration of how she gets to the point we see her at at the end of the series. We do get to see her actions and opinions but I feel like a story that focuses on her would be interesting and awesome. I'd rather no requited Paraietta/Neveril, but other shipping for Paraietta is welcome.

Dominuura! When she showed up with her mysterious faction connections I thought she was going to be some sort of villainess; I'm still fascinated about her political ties. MORE PLEASE, MORE EVERYTHING. Except please no Dominuura/Limone - please keep that platonic or offscreen. What was it like for her to join Choir Tempest? What was her previous choir like? What else about sybillae did she learn from her grandfather?

And please, more about the world! More about what life is like in the mundane world, on the ground - what the sybillae know of that world, and what that world knows of them. Be my guest if you want to explore gender issues in this canon; the set-up is so fascinating.

Soon I Will Be Invincible - Austin Grossman 
Doctor Impossible (Soon I Will Be Invincible), Fatale (Soon I Will Be Invincible), Lily | Erica Lowenstein

I would love any two of these characters to appear. 

Events from Lily's perspective would be rad. What kind of things did she get up to in her villain phase? What did the school and university years look like to her? Is there a kernel of truth to her supervillain origin story? I would love Fatale &amp; Lily hanging out: maybe give me missing scenes in canon that take on more significance later, though I'd also love to see them meet up months or years after the book, on a different footing to how we left them. 

I'd also love to see Lily and Doctor Impossible together - for whatever quality of together, enemies, friends, lovers, none of the above. What did she see in him? Or Fatale and Doctor Impossible meeting up, either having difficult, awkward, spiky, interesting conversations, or being forced to work together for some reason, or matching wits on opposite sides of a mission. Is there an AU in which Fatale is on the side of evil or chaos and Lily and Dr Impossible are on the side of order or good?

And as well as something with spiky, adversarial character dynamics, I'd also love something that tended towards crack or fluff. Fatale has to rescue either Lily or Dr Impossible from a plan gone wrong. Hopefully a ridiculous plan. Dr Impossible tries to recruit Fatale with a false identity. One of them provides an emotional perspective the other needs. Etc.

Sucker Punch (2011) 
Rocket (Sucker Punch), Sweet Pea (Sucker Punch)

This is a polarising movie and I'm one of the people who really enjoys it. I love the different fantasy worlds and the bitter, brutal glamour of the club; I love Baby Doll's and Sweet Pea's grief and anger that carries through the asylum setting. I love the way the themes of self-actualization and sacrifice are used.

I'd love backstory for Rocket and Sweet Pea (extrapolating from canon, or completely AU if you want), or some kind of fix-it fic, for Rocket especially or for as many people and situations as you can manage. I'd love if you treated a different world than the asylum or the brothel as the \"real\" world, or gave Rocket and Sweet Pea their own unusual perspectives on the various worlds - how did they see the places they were transported to? Was every woman in a different universe, working in parallel, perhaps? I'd love if if you invented an entirely new world for our heroines to perform daring missions in. And I'd love an exploration of why Sweet Pea is the film's first and final girl.

Setting AUs, especially unusual settings (circus? angels vs. demons? a faerie court?) would be as welcome as canon divergence AUs; feel free to remix the whole movie to give me something that hits certain plot points or characters or parts of the setting I can recognize, but is otherwise quite radically different.

紅樓夢 - 曹雪芹 | Dream of the Red Chamber - Cao Xueqin 
Ouguan (Dream of the Red Chamber), Yaoguan (Dream of the Red Chamber)

A nineteenth century Chinese novel in translation feels like a perfect Yuletide novel but I know I've made things harder but wanting minor characters. The troop of actresses kept in the garden particularly fascinate me though and Ouguan's passionate love for Yaoguan, even after death, because they played lovers, seems to beg the story of their lives before they came to the Garden or how it changed them.

I know only a very limited number will have seen it but I loved this play so much and the relationship between James and Will was one of the main reasons. I'd love fic with the two of them at any stage from their first meeting as children through their teenage years with Will looking out for James and being his touchstone for reality through to becoming adults and trying to negotiate from friendship into king &amp; subject. Happy or sad, gen or slash I don't mind I just want to read about them!

Last time I saw Richard II live (the 2015 production at Shakespeare's Globe with Charles Edwards to be specific) I was struck by Richard, Henry &amp; Aumerle all being cousins and how the huge struggles of the play could be boiled down to a family drama with rival cousins and I'd quite like to read something exploring that.

Madam Secretary 
Blake Moran

Blake was my ride-or-die favorite character even before he came out, and now I get to ask you to have fun with his canon bisexuality in addition to his talent for sarcasm and his tendency to be in rooms where he probably shouldn't be. If you want to write romance, I lowkey ship him with Dmitri Petrov, but I'd be equally thrilled with a story that explored his dynamics with Elizabeth and/or Nadine. No romantic shipping with them, though, and I'm not a fan of Blake/Mike B., either. This show has become an escapist, Utopian depiction of an alternate United States that is run by competent people who generally mean well, so I'd love an exploration of how the events of 2017 might have played out differently with the Dalton administration in charge. I'd also enjoy reading some Blake backstory, particularly about his time at Harvard or what he did in the time between Wall Street and this job. Or I am always down for an In Space AU.

Pod Save America (RPF) 

I saw PSA in the tag set and my first thought was, a story narrated entirely in commercials, in which each paragraph ends with \"A better way to -----.\" If you're not up for that level of experimental prose, keep it within the bounds of the podcast, but give me the version that would have existed if Hillary Clinton were President. Or Conrad Dalton (see request #1). Or the version that exists after the aliens land and declare their sovereignty over all of humanity. I haven't requested specific characters because I'd prefer an ensemble piece where all are involved. Do your best to keep the irreverent tone of the pod, and to keep it at least somewhat responsive to contemporary American politics.

Figure Skating RPF

Shoma is astounding on the ice, but I'm requesting him for fic because he's one of the most intriguing personalities in figure skating these days. He's shy, he's intensely competitive, he's a daredevil, and he has a wicked sense of humor that sometimes gets him in trouble. Ship him with Yuzuru Hanyu, Keiji Tanaka, or both, or neither. I will also eagerly accept improbable crackshipping with Jason Brown. I'd prefer a story set in the here and now, as he prepares for the Olympics, with all of the different kinds of pressure that puts on him. Make it lighthearted or contemplative, or even PWP, but create some insight into who he is and how he's responding to the world around him.

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 
Deirdre Robespierre

On a show full of damaged people trying to build better lives for themselves, the utter moral vacuity of Deirdre Robespierre haunts me. She's smart, she's the kind of beautiful that will only become harder to maintain over time, she's scratched her way to the top of the Mommy Pyramid in their social circle, and she lied about a break-in when she shot herself. Deirdre's damaged and desperate. I want to know what she was and how she became this, and why she sacrificed every last ounce of her own soul for this empty life she hates. I don't ship her with Jacqueline, but I can definitely see a one-sided obsession on her part with this woman who chooses to throw away the things Deirdre has cut out own heart to get. Does she follow Jacqueline's lead and break away? Does she become a maniacal supervillain complete with cape, touching up her roots with the blood of her enemies? Tell me more about her, please!

Goodnight Saigon - Billy Joel (Song) 

This is my absolute favorite Billy Joel song. It's lyrical and gutting, and it gives no easy answers to anything. I'm not even into traditional war canons as a rule, but I want to know everything about the world of the song. The transition from eager young Marines who thought they'd win in a day to the horror-struck soldiers who discovered their enemy was smart and war was hell. The bonds they created and broke. The story from the other side of the war. Ghosts refighting the same conflict night after night long after the war is over. If Vietnam is too close as a setting, feel free to transpose the characters into other times and places, or even in space. I'd prefer no crossovers with this request.

Brandy (Song) 
Brandy (Brandy)

This song has always bugged me, and watching GotG 2 helped me put my finger on why. Brandy deserves better. I want a story where Brandy is happy. Does her sailor come back one day and stay? Is she happy with the arrangement they have? Does she live the opposite life of that guy who has a girl in every port, and instead, she has a guy on every ship and likes things that way? Does she preferentially go after men with the same name, because there are many Toms and Bobs and Harrys, or does she change out her necklace when Tombobharry is in port? Alternately, does she tell the story of the sailor, the only man she'll ever love, here's his name on her necklace as evidence he existed, then go home each night to the woman the rest of the town thinks is her roommate or her cousin? The point of view in the song is semi-omniscient, but there's a lot of room for other stories the singer doesn't know or isn't telling.

What do they do in the new theatre? Does everyone sign on to perform? You can crossover with any other anthropomorphized animal canon you'd like (Zootopia, BoJack, Roger Rabbit for starting preferences but I'm pretty open) or keep it strictly within the Sing canon.

BoJack Horseman 
Beatrice Horseman, Honey Sugarman, Sarah Lynn

This can be a OR request. This show broke me and I am still ruminating on the last season. I love, for varying definitions of the word, all the characters, and I'd be happy to see any of them appear. I've specifically chosen the characters who cracked open and bled out on the screen. In Bea's memories, Honey became a faceless shadow after her surgery, but Bea's memories are no longer reliable. What was their relationship like after Crackjack and the aftermath? What was it like before? We only saw a glimpse in The Old Sugarman Place, but surely a lot of weird went into creating the bitter woman Bea became. Sarah Lynn bent until she broke, but who else could she have been in another life? Did she daydream about architecture while she was up on stage? Was there ever an opening for her, however small, to escape Hollywoo and her fate, or was in set in stone by everyone around her? Like the Sing request, this can be crossed over with other anthropomorphized animal properties or not as you choose.

♥ Cook and Gunnar as the only god-damned adults on this god-damned ship (some days, anyway). (And then they commiserate and have sex?)

Pitch (TV 2016) 
Ginny Baker, Mike Lawson

I was in a rut for days after finding out that Pitch was canceled. There was so much left unresolved! Please see letter for why I requested this fandom and what I would love to see in a fic.

A few story ideas:

- Hurt/Comfort in dealing with Ginny’s anxiety/panic attack or some lingering PTSD with the car accident.

- The team and the media having fun and talking about how Ginny and Mike are perfect for each other and how they know every single thing about each other while remaining completely oblivious to the fact.

Things I don’t like: Alternate Universes, Non-Con/Rape/BDSM/Sexual Violence/Graphic Sex, OT3s, Character Bashing (see letter for further explanation of each of these)

The Darkest Minds Series - Alexandra Bracken 
Ruby Daly, Liam Stewart

Liam is such a sweetheart and Ruby is a precious gem that needs to be protected at all costs, even if it’s from herself. Please see letter for why I requested this fandom and what I would love to see in a fic.

Story ideas:

- Reunions are the best. Write how you would have liked the Liam and Ruby reunion in Book 2 to have played out or expand on canon to bring on even more feels. Other character reunions are also welcome (with Liam/Ruby as the main characters).

- Show Ruby’s struggle with her abilities and how she copes in healthy/unhealthy ways.

- I wish there were more scenes exploring the dynamics of Cole, Liam, and Ruby (not in an OT3 sort of way). Writing an extension of the scene that took place in the shower with Ruby and Cole where they talk more about their respective relationships with Liam and their powers would be interesting.

- Write a “scene between scenes” dealing with some of your favorite dramatic moments of the book series.

Tru Calling 
Tru Davies, Davis (Tru Calling)

THIS SHOW… It’s been over a decade and I’m still not over its cancellation. I requested two characters, but Tru is the only character that needs to be included; Davis can be included as her bantering co-worker/friend or side character if desired. Please see letter for why I requested this fandom and what I would love to see in a fic.

Story ideas:

- Continue the story. This can be your own headcanon of what would have happened, or what the various cast/crew members revealed would have happened (basically the show was going to revolve around the mythology of two opposing forces in the world that balanced each other out in terms of life/death).

- Write an episode-like story where Tru gets the traditional “save me” in the morgue and goes back in time to save their life. 

- Show the toll that all of Tru’s dealings with death are having on her, and how certain people in her life help her cope (i.e. Jack, Davis…)

- Flash forward into the future where Tru and Jack (or an original male character that has the same abilities as Tru) have become reluctant friends (or more?) and Davis is simultaneously appalled by the idea and also like “I knew this was going to happen all along.” (REMEMBER: No pressure to include Jack - I think it’s hard to continue canon without him, but I know there were some that weren’t his fans)

The Defenders (Marvel TV) 
Jessica Jones (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Luke Cage (The Defenders (Marvel TV)), Matt Murdock (The Defenders (Marvel TV))

I am hardcore Luke/Jessica, but I totally get the appeal of Jessica/Matt, so a fic with them as the pairing would be okay with me as well (no OT3s). Please see letter for why I requested this fandom and what I would love to see in a fic.

Story ideas:

- Luke and Jessica learning to trust each other again amongst the events of The Defenders, and Jessica sharing a bit more of her past with Kilgrave to help Luke understand what exactly she went through.

- Jessica Jones is a walking poster child for PTSD and I would really like to see this explored more. Recovery isn’t necessary, but having at least someone else realize her suffering (Luke, Matt, etc.) and talking it out a little would be great.

- Out of all of the relationships in The Defenders, I think Matt and Jessica’s was the most interesting. They had a natural chemistry and seemed to form a bond rather quickly. An exploration of their burgeoning relationship through the eyes of others would be fascinating.

Things I don’t like: Alternate Universes, Non-Con/Rape/BDSM/Sexual Violence/Graphic Sex, OT3s, Character Bashing (see letter for further explanation of each of these)

Kushiel's Legacy - Jacqueline Carey 
Joscelin Verreuil, Phedre no Delaunay

I would be gleefully thrilled – elated, euphoric, delighted! – with some wild smut for this couple. Joscelin and Phedre - loyalty and heartbreak and love all at once. This pairing takes my love for opposites-attract couples, stirs in BDSM and passion, adds my bullet-proof kink for priests with smudges on their souls, and results in everything I like to read. My special favorite scenes in the first trilogy are Joscelin and Phedre's first time together in the cave and their reunions, both in the Yeshuite camp and when Joscelin is 'all over fish'. :) So fics with that sort of feel are especially welcome. This is the perfect couple for that 'losing your composure' passion I mentioned above. Maybe Joscelin decides to start working through the Trois Milles Joies to surprise Phedre. Maybe Phedre teases/seduces Joscelin until he can't take it anymore - or maybe he turns the tables on her! Go wild with this. The kinkier, the better.

Nightrunner Series - Lynn Flewelling 
Alec í Amasa, Seregil í Korit, Thero í Procepios, Atre

I threw in all the characters there for some variety but what I'm really interested in is Alec and Seregil. I'd love to read more about them; their adventures, their relationship. Anything you can come up with, really. I'm not really in for pure PWP, however, and would love there to be some kind of emotional... chunks... in there. (And some drama would be very much welcomed)...

And because I have a huge, huge, huge love of AUs, I'd even take an AU that explores what could have been if Seregil and Alec met later in life. How would they fall in love? I think I'd love to see a sort of exploration of that relationship and why it works and if their partnership could be replicated under different circumstances. (Is it fate? The will of Illior? Or just plain luck?)

PS, I threw in Atre there if you ever need a bad guy for plot reasons, but otherwise his involvement is very very optional...

Tinker Bell (Movies) 
Zarina (Disney Fairies), James Hook (Disney Fairies)

For a good long while this year and the last, one of the Disney Fairies movies were always on in the background. I listened a little more closely on one of the numerous repeat viewings of Pirate Fairy, though, and a question struck me as I watched Zarina and James pirating over Neverland: Why can he understand her? Of course, because I am a sucker for romance, I immediately went to a shippy place. Is it true love and if so, how do they deal with that after becoming enemies? Did Zarina figure out a dust to make him understand her and decide to only use it on him? How angsty did their affair get when he decided to betray her? Did they keep going back to each other throughout the years, even as their respective camps became more and more enemies?

My perfect fic would be scenes of them throughout the years, getting angstier and angstier as time goes on (and then super nostalgic at the end, when they figure out that they have been enemies for so long when they could have worked so well together, siiigh). I would love all of these: How did Zarina convince him to let her became part of the crew, and even captain? How does he decide to betray her despite their steamy relationship? Is he conflicted about it at all? How is it the first time they see each other after their combat at the end of the movie? I'd love to hear about how she gets back at him - she was pretty naive during the movie, which, of course, but I'd love to see her wise up and beat Hook at his own game.

If you want to go to a steamy place, I am very fine with that. You can deal with the size thing however you want - magically make one the other's size, have Zarina disappear in his clothes while he's working with the crew, just handwave the whole thing completely, whatever. (I don't necessarily have a size kink, but I will follow you wherever you want to go.)

Remember Me? - Sophie Kinsella 
Jon (Remember Me), Lexi Smart

Oh man, do I ever love this book. It's written in such a great way, with the reader uncovering mysteries along with Lexi. I love the humor in it, too (which isn't a given with Kinsella books - sometimes I find them too heavy-handed with the second-hand embarassment). I really like the sideplots, with Lexi's old friends, with the way she saves her job. But I can't lie, the big, big draw for me is the relationship between Lexi and Jon. It is so great and we get so little of it!

I want to know how they got together the first time. I want the guilt combined with the feeling of finally finding the only person who understood her - all of her (\"You left stuff here.\"). I want the secrecy (that plan they cooked up so they wouldn't be found out!), I want the rushed sex because they have so little time together, I want the nights they did have together and how magical it felt to feel like a normal couple. I want the angst of their relationship combined with the sunflowery-ness of it.

I want to see his perspective on the events of the book. (I'd love to get his perspective on all of it! He keeps things pretty close to his chest and yet he feels so much. He's been looking after that last sunflower so closely!) I want more/alternate scenes where he tries to convince her, to make her realise. I want to see them fall in love again. I want Lexi to get her memories back, or not, I want to see how they work together after the book. 

In case it's not obvious, basically anything with the two of them would make me happy. I do think I'd like the fic to stay close-ish to canon than go super AU (though canon divergence is fine), since I feel like there's a lot left to explore there!

Hamilton - Miranda (Broadway Cast) RPF 
Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton Broadway Cast RPF)

I feel like there are no non-cliché ways of saying how much I love Lin-Manuel, so I'll just say that I love him and he is the best. Hamilton defined so much of my life in the last two years, and the original cast is a big part of that. I requested this a couple of years ago, before I knew much of anything about Broadway or about these people, but now I'm even more excited to read about them.

I don't particularly want anything shippy (unless you count the fact that everyone loves each other!!), I'd just love to get to read about the show, and the making of it. I'd love to read about Lin's writing of it, with Vanessa always by his side, how the birth of his son paralled the creation of the show, how sleep-deprivation probably made him even more intense/excited/Lin-ish than usual. I want to read about the show itself, I'd love to have just dialogue (or twitter!) of everybody shooting the shit, teasing each other, having weird rituals/running jokes. I want to read about writing the Moana songs, getting Chris and Pippa to do the demos, how the rest of the cast felt when Lin was gone. I want to read about the reunion they'll do, about how it is when they get together again for various projects, about how they'll support each other in their new projects as best as they can, about how Hamilton will always be a part of their legacy. I want to read about them being astronauts on a new mission, or superheroes. I just want more of Lin and the gang. ♥

Non-Lin favorites are Chris and Pippa, plus Karen Olivo and Mandy Gonzalez if you want to write some \"passing of the torch\" feelings when the original cast left, but I love everyone in this room, so go wiiiild. And please don't get too political, real life is hard enough!

The Illuminae Files - Amie Kaufman & Jay Kristoff 
Ezra Mason, Kady Grant

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: Life on Kerenza Backstory! Missing Scenes! What Happens Next? What COULD have happened?

In one of my favorite - and most entertaining - openings to date, Kady breaks up with Ezra just in time for the world as they know it to be blown to smithereens. What I want to know is HOW DID THEY GET TO THAT POINT? How did they get together? How did they fall in love? More details on Ezra’s struggle to NOT tell Kady the secret of his mother &amp; Kady’s frustration with Ezra’s reticence would be fantastic. There are hints throughout ILLUMINAE that stirrings of BeiTech’s machinations against the UTA were already running through the universe pre-the events of the book, so bonus points if those details are foreshadowed or discussed amongst the characters.

Bouncing from there, Kady &amp; Ezra spent most - if not all - of ILLUMINAE on either separate ships or out of contact. I would love to see more missing scenes of their day to day lives &amp; thoughts on the other a la Ezra’s drunken/desperate emails at the start of the book and Kady’s secret journal log. Were there more drafts Ezra never sent? Discussions he had with teammates while training? Discussions of Ezra between Kady and her fellow hacker? How far back did AIDAN’s investigation, by the way, into their relationship go? What thoughts of AIDAN, if any, did we not see? Did AIDAN know Ezra had survived? AIDAN is, again, not a mandatory inclusion, but I do find his relationship with Kady, and his fascination with her and Ezra, ever so interesting.

Speaking of Ezra surviving, I would definitely love to know what he was doing while Kady was off on her death mission - what are his thoughts when he realizes she had left the ship? When did he realize WHERE she had gone? How did he spend his time until he discovered she had survived? Was he busy writing unread (or AIDAN read) emails of his own?

While Hanna &amp; Nik are not mandatory to include, I would also definitely love to see fic exploring the aftermath of both ILLUMINAE/GEMINAE and the sending of the ILLUMINAE files. When exactly did Ezra, Kady, Hanna, &amp; Nik start putting together the ILLUMINAE dossier to send to Executive Director Frobisher? While still on the Hypatia &amp; before they’d encountered Heimdall? Or on their way to Kerenza (or even after)? What is the dynamic between Ezra, Kady, Hanna, &amp; Nik? How much of a role did AIDAN play in the making of the files and how involved is he in Kady and Ezra’s machinations now? Speaking of AIDAN, while he is by no means a necessary inclusion, how does he feel about Ezra &amp; Kady’s relationship once reunited? What kind of relationship do Ezra and him have? Honestly, I’d even just love fic of the team recuperating and hanging out on Hypatia as they all get to know each other.

Alternatively, I need about 1 million more words speculating the aftermath of GEMINA in Universe B. Or the events during GEMINA in Universe B. Or the events of ILLUMINAE in Universe B. Pick your poison, really, but I am fascinated by Universe B - or the possible Universes C, D, and E that could exist beyond. Seriously, feel free to go wild here. What if’s galore!

For all of these prompts, utilizing the epistolary style of the book is, of course, optional (though I most definitely would not object to it!)

Spindle Cove Series - Tessa Dare 
Minerva Highwood, Colin Sandhurst, Charlotte Highwood, Piers Brandon

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: Missing or Pre-book Scenes! Life after the HEA! AU it (AKA Modern Day AU)!

<i>Either/Or Requests</i>: So long as either Charlotte &amp; Piers OR Minerva &amp; Colin are included, I shall be happy.

My requests for this fandom are, I would say, my most straightforward ones. This series is one of my happy romance places, and as such, I just want more fun romance shenanigans, however they may come to be!

Both couples have such fun, fodder-filled tumbles into love, and while their stories are everything to me, I would never object to more - particularly in the case of Minerva &amp; Colin. We know they had a rather antagonistic relationship pre-gallivant to Scotland, and I would love to see more of their interactions from that time. Colin denying any attraction to Minerva; Minerva denying anything likeable about Colin. What if’s and could have been’s re: their falling in love are, of course, more than acceptable as well - I do always love a good “caught in a compromising position &amp; rushed to the altar” trope.

As for post-HEA, I cannot deny the desire to see more as well! Gimme Minerva &amp; Colin settling into married life, and Colin being the beaming husband to Minerva’s scientist self. How do they split their days between London &amp; Spindle Cove? How does Minerva handle society? Colin not feeling like he’s good enough? Alternatively, I would adore seeing Charlotte &amp; Piers, married spy couple in action - think of their adventures! How does Charlotte’s spy training go? What kind of shenanigans do they get into? Bonus points if you give Delia the much-needed HEA she deserved.

Last but not least, I would love, love, love to see some AUs here. Spies, clearly is a natural one for Charlotte/Piers! College professors or professor/professional playboy for Minerva/Colin! College! Sports! Corporate Rivals! Really, feel free to go wild here!

Maiden Lane Series - Elizabeth Hoyt 
Artemis Greaves, Maximus Batten | Duke of Wakefield, Margaret \"Megs\" Reading, Godric St. John

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: AU it (AKA Superhero AU)! Missing or Pre-book Scenes! What if’s!

<i>Either/Or Requests</i>: So long as either Artemis &amp; Maximus OR Megs &amp; Godric are included, I shall be happy.

My requests for this fandom are going to sound fairly similar to my requests for the Spindle Cove series, with a few small differences. This series is another one of my happy romance places, and as such, I just want more fun romance shenanigans, however they may come to be!

As much as I love each couple’s original stories, there is nothing I would love to see more for this fandom than AU fic. Mostly because the Ghost of St. Giles lends itself to an AU so well! My most first suggestion, of course, is going to be a superhero AU (established superheroes, from fandoms I already love like Iron Man &amp; Arrow are great, as are original superheroes based off the Ghost), but I think spies, heists, thieves &amp; agents, etc. work here as well! Given Hoyt’s fondness for framing devices, fairytale AUs would be fun as well! But really, I am an AU-holic, so feel free to go wild here!

My secondary requests here are much more straightforward. Both couples have such fun, fodder-filled tumbles into love, and while their stories are everything to me, I would never object to more - particularly in the case of Megs &amp; Godric. I know Hoyt has a short story depicting some of their letters to each other, but really, I’d love to see Godric’s fall-by-letter in completion and/or more pine tree-worthy detail.

What if’s and could have been’s re: either couple’s falling in love are, of course, also catnip for me - I do always love a good “caught in a compromising position &amp; rushed to the altar” trope &amp; think that could be great fun for Artemis &amp; Max, in a world where Apollo was never falsely imprisoned. Alternatively, a world where either Godric or Max had been caught as the Ghost and had been ostracized by society? How would they meet their lady loves then? This is another prompt where any variation is bound to make me happy, so feel free to go wild!

Anastasia - Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally 
Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov Grand Duchess of Russia (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally), Dimitri | Dmitry (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally), Gleb Vaganov (Flaherty/Ahrens/McNally)

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: All of the Missing Scenes! Backstory Exploration! In-Canon &amp; Alternate-Reality AUs! What’s Next Fic! AU it, any style!

<i>Shipping</i>: I only ship Anastasia/Dimitri, so while I’m obviously okay with you sticking with Gen if you do not, I do request that there be NO Anastasia/Dimitri/Gleb or Anastasia/Gleb pairings (the only exception is Gleb unrequitedly pining for Anya/Anastasia).

You can guess that if every lonely girl would hope she’s a princess, that would yes, including this one. My love for this movie is intense, so you can only imagine the excitement in my theatre-girl loving heart when it was finally adopted into a real Broadway musical! And while the team, cast, &amp; crew did absolutely amazing things with this childhood classic, there is definitely a lot of fic to be had with what wasn’t there.

To start, while I understood the practical reasons for changing Anya &amp; Dimitri’s backstory, my romance-loving heart was more than a little upset at the downplaying of their enemies-to-lovers/childhood crushes romance. I would love more scenes of their perhaps less antagonistic, but no less fire-y relationship as Anya “Learn[ed] to Do It” or while the gang traveled from Russia to Paris during the “Traveling Sequence.” Similarly, while Ramin did his best, I was hoping for a more menacing and/or layered villain re: Gleb, so any scenes to fill that gap would be very welcome. For example, I desperately wanted Dimitri &amp; Vlad to be more aware of the threat GIeb posed to Anya’s life, so more scenes or indications of him actually posing a threat would be great.  It’s also implied that Gleb, rather than Dimitri, knew Anya when they were children, so I’d love to see more of the backstory there and a stronger understanding of his feelings for Anya in the present day. In essence, while I understood the reasons for many of the plot changes in the musical, I left feeling that too many questions re: the plot and character arcs were left unanswered/unsatisfied, so any fic that filled in those gaps would make me extremely happy.

On that same note, if you feel that the plot of the musical would be better served with some rewriting or what if scenarios, go for it! Give Gleb a completely new story arc - make him a guard from the palace turned Communist! Revive Dimitri &amp; Anya’s childhood friendship and throw childhood-rival Gleb in! What if Gleb had taken a shot at Anya at the ballet? What if Anya had been dancing in the ballet when she’d found Dimitri? What if Anya had stayed with her grandmother &amp; Dimitri had come back to her, instead of the other way around?

I am also a true history nerd, so I have all the questions re: Anastasia &amp; Dimitri’s lives post-musical. Where are Anastasia &amp; Dimitri when the stirrings of WWII/Nazi Germany begins? What are Maria &amp; Anastasia’s discussions like re: the potential fallout/benefits of the return of the Russian monarchy - does Anastasia feel her people would be better or worse without her, as tales from communist Russia continue to spread? Do they stay in Paris permanently? Do they travel? Go to America? Visit her relatives in every country in Europe? I’m also here for Anastasia &amp; Dimitri, WWII spies, just to throw that out here.

Jumping off, this is obviously a story ripe with AU potential and I would love to see it retold in any which universe. Contemporary mob AU! Space AU! Magical monarchies AU! Steampunk AU! Ballet royalty AU (The Ballet Sequence is 100% one of my favorite new bits in the show)! Mix &amp; match with any of my favorite fandoms (Lunar Chronicles AU, I’m thinking would be great fun)! Really, there is no way to go wrong here.

Still Star-Crossed (TV) 
Benvolio Montague (Still Star-Crossed), Rosaline Capulet (Still Star-Crossed)

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: Missing or Pre-Series Scenes! What’s Next Fic! All of the AUs!

Oh this series. This series. My trashfire romance series, in essence. Do I care the plot is nonsensical and the costumes are in no way historically accurate and the Shakespeare references are bad/obvious enough to stick an elephant through? Fuck no I care about my ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS TROPIEST OF TROPE BABIES. And, really, that’s all I’m asking for here. Rosaline and Benvolio hit upon all my enemies-to-lovers, I’m not good enough for you but goddamnit I am gonna try/I am too busy being awesome to deal with your angst but I will save your ridiculous boy ass buttons, and you know what, I am here for that. So, while the series gives us a lot of the pining eyes &amp; the Rosaline realizing Benvolio is actually kind of less of a dick than Escalus, because at least he has a backbone, I would like all the in-between moments before and after please. The Pilot episode implies Rosaline and Benvolio had known each other before becoming engaged, thanks to our star-crossed idiots, so what were their first impressions like? When did their thinking start to change from disinterest/hate to attraction? Or was it always a little bit more interest, a little bit less hate? All of the Benvolio pining, I mean, is what I am saying.

Moving forward - that cliffhanger! That cliffhanger! Seriously. What is going on with Rosaline and Benvolio now? Or are they Excellent Students at Avoidance because There is A Lot of Stuff to Deal With? How much does Paris, asshole of all assholes, stand to fuck shit up and when is everyone going to crown Isabel so she can start getting shit done? Rosaline &amp; Benvolio rescuing Livia would also be great - hopefully more effectively than their last few save the day attempts.

Of course, this is another story RIFE with AU scenarios, all of which would be so much fun to play with. Crime fighting AUs? Regency AU? Government assassins with crushes AU? Even ridiculous high school/college/some kind of contemporary sports AU could be lovely here as well. These are, of course, only suggestions and possible prompts. This world is full of so many fun possibilities, in essence, and if any strike your fancy (mine or of your own making!), I would love to see where that goes!

Designated Survivor (TV) 
Tom Kirkman, Alex Kirkman, Aaron Shore, Emily Rhodes

<b>Possible Prompts</b>: Backstory and Missing Scenes! What If fic!

<i>Either/Or Request</i>: So long as either Tom &amp; Alex OR Aaron &amp; Emily are included, I shall be happy.

I love this show because it is pretty much the political show we need right now, but what I want from this show is pretty much romance and ladies.

Tom and Alex are such a fucking great, steady couple, so obviously, I would like more of their story. How they met! How they fell in love! Their decision for Tom to be Leo’s father 100%. I’d also love more missing moments of their marriage now that Tom’s president - Tom sharing the day-to-day burdens with Alex, Alex dealing with being First Lady and potentially putting a hold on her own career for the moment, their discussions with the kids, etc.

Aaron and Emily - not such a steady couple, but hi, hello, they have such great chemistry it hurts. They started the series on such an antagonistic foot, before moving to respect, then like, then attraction, and and all I want is more. How did they start off on such a bad foot? When and where did things start to change for them? How did that attraction flicker &amp; falter after Aaron left the White House (and then came back)? And most of all, what’s next for them? To they even dare to go forward? (Yes, obviously they do, but you know, how).

Alternatively, I am 100% gone for the ladies of this series, and I kind of would love to see a What If Women Ruled the World AU. Gimme Alex in the line of succession as the Designated Survivor (maybe not as HUD Secretary but as Attorney General or Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services?). Gimme Emily as the White House Chief of Staff, dealing with newcomers who think she’s a traitor. Or Emily as Alex’s Chief of Staff! I am here for the ladies, basically. Including Hannah as her badass self would obviously be delightful as well. 

**I will be watching season 2 of DESIGNATED SURVIVOR as it airs and may add a prompt or two as we go, but please do not feel obligated to keep up with the episodes or take notice of additional prompts if you have already started writing or have ideas!**
