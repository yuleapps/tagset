涼宮ハルヒ | Suzumiya Haruhi - All Media Types 
Suzumiya Haruhi, Kyon (Suzumiya Haruhi)

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

I love this series for its weirdness and its genre-hopping, but especially the strange rules of its universe and all the odd things you can do with them. I've nominated Haruhi and Kyon as characters; I ship it, but I'd be just as happy with fic about them as friends, or an it's-complicated-I-don't-know-what-we-are, or the UST thing they have going on in canon.

Some ideas I'd especially enjoy: Kyon gets hit with a truth spell; a look at their lives years in the future and how their relationship changes; any kind of supernatural weirdness; Kyon gains powers because Haruhi wants them to be equals

If you're up for writing porn, that would be cool, but I'd prefer it be set after they've finished high school. That said, I'd love to see fic explore what could happen with Haruhi's powers during sex.

Shoujo Kakumei Utena | Revolutionary Girl Utena 
Tenjou Utena, Himemiya Anthy

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

Every character in this series is brilliant, but Anthy and Utena's relationship is what I fell in love with the first time I watched it, and I'd really like fic about them as a couple. Some ideas:

    a missing scene about their developing relationship while they're still at school and everything's still very complicated - when was their first kiss, and were they really on the same page about their relationship then?
meeting again after school - how are things different when Anthy's been independent and looking after herself for a while now
If you're up for writing porn, I'd love some reunion sex for these two, the sweatier and filthier the better

Wayfarers Series - Becky Chambers 
Sidra (Wayfarers Series)

General likes and dislikes in my letter.

Sidra really sucked me in - something about her is really relatable even though I have never been a spaceship computing system stuck in a human-ish body kit. The way she goes about exploring her new world, and finding a lot of pleasure in it even though it's often challenging and upsetting to her, was really beautiful to me. I'd love some fic about her continuing to explore her new human-ish life.

    I loved the bit about Sidra looking to get a tattoo, and I'd like to see her try body modification again, whether it's tattooing or piercing or something else altogether, or everything she can find.
I don't ship Sidra with anyone in particular, but I'd love to see her exploring a relationship with someone, and especially exploring more of what touch means to her, whether it's with Pepper and Blue, or Tak, or an original character. I don't know what sex would be like for Sidra, but that would be something interesting to explore too.
I'm interested in how Sidra enjoys parties and festivals but interacts with them differently to other people. Going to parties and exploring dancing and meeting new people would be nice.

Battle Creek (TV) 
Russ Agnew, Milt Chamberlain

Russ/Milt slash would put me over the moon! There just isn't enough good slash for these two as a couple. If you feel you have it in you to write non-AU slash for these two, where Russ is his cantankerous, suspicious self and Milt is an assortment of secrets and sly wit hiding under a well-pressed suit and a Pollyanna smile, go for it!
If slash isn't your thing, I'd love a Gen fic focusing on these two. Any and all of the other characters are welcome to make an appearance, but please no Russ/Holly in place of Gen, and again… not AU. I love the characters and settings in their Battle Creek form, and just wish we'd gotten several more seasons of it.

Justified 
Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder

I'd love Raylan/Boyd slash, but if not then I'd prefer purely Gen. I love the complicated relationship between these two, the sense of them being not quite friends and not quite enemies. If Art were to make an appearance to snark the place up, I wouldn't mind. Drunk!fic, pre-series (the coal-mining days), collaboration, reluctant attraction-- all suggestions, none required, just trying to offer some inspiration.

Die Hard (Movies) 
John McClane, Matt Farrell

John/Matt slash is always welcome (not kinky, please), or a Gen relationship fic. These two characters are opposite who balance each other surprisingly well, and usually with their own particular brand of dry, snarky humor. Matt trying to find a new job, or John in the throes of yet another dangerous adventure, or the two of them discovering romance in an unexpectedly masculine package, but again... this is just in case you need inspiration.

I wish we saw more of these two interacting. I feel like they actually could have a lot to offer each other, with their respective difficult secrets and troubled childhoods.

Trixie grew up with a man suffering PTSD - how does she feel about again living with someone who suffered in the war?

Mona Lisa Smile (2003) 
Giselle Levy, Elizabeth "Betty" Warren

I was so worried for what their ending would be, the first time I saw this movie (way back on DVD hire in like 2004), and so, so delighted for what happened. I must admit I fast forward a lot of the film on my rewatches but never them. I want to know about their lives together (I admit I ship it pretty hard, but close and supportive friendship would also be lovely). We never see them agree to live together - how did that conversation go? How does their flat look/get arranged/feel like to them? Where do they go, what do they eat, who do they meet? Or maybe you'd like to retell the arc of their relationship in the movie, or even before the canon.

The Martian (2015) 

So much to love about this movie (I also read the book, and I'm happy for you to draw on either/both). I mean, I love Mars, I love science competence that solves things, I love teams that go back to get the last guy, I love quests, I love the whole Earth getting united to Fix The Thing, I love snark about Aquaman. This was always going to suit me *g* 

As I've said above, I'm into stories about people interacting, generally speaking, so if you want to go the romance route Your Ship of Choice (including OT3 or more, with a preference for people being at least a bit queer somehow) is fine by me - I've seen various combinations for this fandom and liked them. Or cross people over into other fandoms as you like. I'd also love Space and Science to get in there - like what about future space missions? What about the first Mars colony? What about Saturn and it's cool moons? You could go to a Star Trek or Cloud Atlas type place or keep it more as The Nasa Coffee Shop, it's all good

The Americans (TV 2013) 
Elizabeth Jennings, Paige Jennings

Ok I finally started watching the Americans this year. I’m OBSESSED. 

Specifically, I really love Elizabeth and her dynamic with Paige. While I ship Phillip/Elizabeth, I’m more interested in the dynamic between mother and daughter. The similarities and differences between them – how Paige feels about her heritage, the added tension of raising a teenager who could ruin their lives.

To that end, I’d love something that explores the two of them. Maybe Paige gets dragged further in and goes on missions? How do her parents really feel about that? How does Paige feel about that?

Or maybe Paige rebels and outs her parents to Stan. What happens then?

What happens if Paige kills someone? What does that do to her? 

Or: Paige as a young-ish adult, out of college. Where is she and her family now?  Is she a spy? Did she get a normal life? Did they move back to Russia? Stay in the US?

If none of these grab you – I also would love to see Elizabeth in a spy mission where she seduces a woman. But not in a soft way, in a very Elizabeth way. You don’t have to include Paige if you go with this idea.

Note: I wrote this only having seen through season 4, but s5 is on Amazon Prime soon and I’ll be all caught up by December, so if any of this has been jossed, or you want to build on what happens in season 5, that’s totally fine!

The real draw of the Magicians for me is Julia, Marina (rip), and Kady. These characters hit the beats I tend to like in my media and I find that their stories are far more interesting than Fillory/Brakebills as magic in the real world is what interests me.

Ultimately this is a show about magic. There’s a lot of places you can go here. I’m pretty open to them all, except Fillory. I ship both Wickoff and Marina/Julia pretty hardcore and would love to see something hella tropey (soulmates, body swap, bound together etc) with either one of those two ships because they’re not characters who would take very kindly to that. 

I’d also like to see something from one of the other timelines where Julia is a student at Brakebills. What does that mean? I mean, yeah, Quentin dies in all of those timelines but *cough* I don’t care about that.

OR. More Hedgewitch backstory. How did Marina become so powerful? What would’ve happened if Julia hadn’t been kicked out?  What if Marina hadn’t died?  Who takes over after Marina’s gone?

Okay, this show man, this show. We could have had it all, but unfortunately MTV sucks. But I loved this show, I sat in on panels about this show at Austin TV Fest, I pimped it to everyone who would let me talk their ear off about it.

But, enough about my love and affection for it. What I want from you, should we match on this, is any of the following: case fic, post-finale fic, fic that leads up to what Jen said the ending would be (had she been able to get more seasons) where Ophelia takes the fall for Jules, fic that delves deeper into Ophelia’s fractured relationship with her mother. I am pretty open on the ship spectrum here – canon ships, Juphelia, Kennedy/Ophelia, Kennedy/Jules, Jules/Harris etc etc. The only real hard passes are poly ships and Ophelia and Harris, as I see their relationship as sibling-esque.

Please note: I requested the girls because I want the story to center around them, but I do love Harris as well, so please feel free to include him!

-"Are you fucking my hound?"- Considering how Gabriel was very careful in trying to establish a sense of equality between him and Max, and not to make Max feel like he was a thing, how would their relationship change if they were fucking (from the start)? Would it be a power play on one of their parts? Gabriel trying to keep Max loyal or Max trying to make sure Gabriel finds him useful? Would it change things down the line?
-Osteomancer!Gabriel AU- I feel like this would be pretty dark, but I'm also very intrigued by how osteomancer!Gabriel would be different from how he is in canon. How would his and Max's relationship be different, considering Max's sensitive nose and Gabriel's relatives?
-What happened during the ten years between California Bones and Pacific Fire? What sort of power plays went down in LA that the new Director of the Water Department and his Assistant Director had to deal with? How did the progression from allies to best friends go, and did they even notice the progression? How many attempts on Gabriel's life have they had to deal with (or on Max's life)? How many people assume they're fucking, and are they/did they?
-What happens after? Getting shot didn't stop Gabriel from working, and Max stays by his side, so does this continue? Does Gabriel train up a protege or do they go out in a blaze of glory or what? If you want them to go out in a blaze of glory, then consider the 'permanent major character death' DNW lifted, but please don't linger on the process of them actually dying.
-What was Max's life like before Gabriel?

Lightless Series - C.A. Higgins 

General/Narrative Likes: monsters; magical realism; larger-than-life characters/scenarios; canon-divergent AUs; non-mundane AUs; future-fic; adventure; character studies; need vs want vs have; missing scenes; ethical dilemmas; friendship; found/made family; competence; cooking; dream sequences (that aren’t the entire fic); banter; fight sequences; introspection; worldbuilding; time travel; loyalty (to people or to causes); casefic

Ship-related Likes: Complicated feelings; bad at feelings; friends-to-lovers; enemies-to-lovers; slow burn; awkward flirting; fake relationships turned real; intimacy; sensory details; handholding; pining; forehead-touching; hand-holding

DNW: Pregnancy; body horror or body modification beyond canon-levels; A/B/O; incest; major character death (permanent); infidelity/cheating as a focus or plot point; medical kink; underage (15 and under); hopeless endings; mundane AUs; issuefic

&nbsp;

-What happens next? For Althea, who defied Ananke? For Mattie and Ivan, together now but heading towards an unstable rebellion? For Ananke, who has been rejected by all three of her "parents"? Where does the revolution, fractured and scared, go from here? Does Ananke go after Mattie and Ivan again?
-We know Ivan flirts with/seduces targets, and we see Mattie's jealousy. I'd love to read about Ivan undertaking a longer-term seduction and how that affects his relationship with Mattie. Pining, unstated (unrecognized?) feelings, sexual tension...all good. If you want to keep it in-line with canon and leave everything unspoken, that's cool, or if you want to go canon-divergent and have something happen between them, that's also cool.
-More about Ananke and Althea's relationship. Althea tried to kill Ananke, and Ananke punished her in a horrific manner. Now they're stuck with each other, so how does that go?
-I'd love to read more about Ivan, Mattie, and Constance, pre-series. I know Constance isn't nominated (four slot limit :/), but she's a huge part of their characters, so if you want to write about her, please do!
-Worldbuilding! There's so much that can be done with worldbuilding, and I'd be delighted to read any of it.

Ni no Kuni 
Oliver (Ni no Kuni)

So, what does one do after one has saved the world? Tell me about Oliver’s life post-game! Show me Oliver using magic to discreetly help out the people from his town, or going back to the other world to explore, or just hang out with his friends. The game hinted there are other parallel worlds out there: what are they like? What will Oliver be when he grows up: a racecar driver, a zookeeper, a professor at Hogwarts?
Ahem: the Great Sage Oliver. If Oliver hasn’t earned the title by the end of his adventures, he’s certainly well on the way. It doesn’t seem like a very demanding job when there aren’t any evil overlords around, but surely they do something with their time. Maybe a plucky traveller from the other world needs the legendary Great Sage’s expertise and has a hard time reconciling their expectations with reality?
Oliver could return to see the people whose hearts he mended during the game, and discover why exactly Shadar broke their hearts in the first place. Why was it so important to the Dark Jinn that this little catgirl not get a proper education? Why did that couple HAVE TO be thwarted from opening their shop???
At the end of the game, Oliver promises he’ll get on with his life. Is it that simple? Do his Motorville friends notice the changes in him? Is it weird to be friends with two versions of the same person? Is it hard to go back to school? How does Oliver pay the mortgage? Do child services notice he’s living alone?
Oliver survived the death of his soulmate, because Shazar severed their connection. But… is it really that easy? Are there no ill effects whatsoever to only having half a soul? Of course, his mom’s time-travelling universe-jumping antics managed to erase hers from existence altogether and she seemed fine (although… was this the reason she had heart troubles?).

Fate/Zero 
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne | Lancer (Fate/Zero), Arturia Pendragon | Saber (Fate/Zero)

These two give me life, from the moment they met and decided they were going to be Chivalry Buddies in this ruthless battle royale, to the bitter, bitter end. I’d love to have something shippy for them!
Missing scenes or stolen moments, no matter how little canon support there is - just them getting away from the war and simply hanging out, sparring to their hearts’ content, and why not a roll in the hay or two while they’re at it? Getting to know each other better, the awkward realization that he’s basically Irish Lancelot, the different ways their respective cultures interpret chivalry (and neither being quite what modern people think of as chivalry - more enemies’ heads as trophies, less ‘butbutbut I can’t hit a girl!’). Fun stuff!
Another possible tack is the fixit - perhaps in the AU created by Fate/Grand Order’s Accel Zero event if you’re familiar with that, or any canon divergence of your choosing. Maybe the canon divergence point is that they had different masters, or were summoned in a different class. How would that change things?
Or maybe an even more awful AU that flips the order of their deaths, or something equally tragic? Maybe Fate/Zero, sad as it was, was in fact the least horrible path their story could have taken?
Post-canon fic. Why not? There’s F/GO of course, a hypothetical sixth Grail War, an AU version of the fifth… There’s plenty of ways they could meet again! And it would be so awkward. He died cursing her, thinking she betrayed him, after all. It’s the kind of things that takes a while before one can get over it. (That just makes the reconciliation all the sweeter!) Just them slowly overcoming all that and growing close again, please. (Two things: 1)It prooobably doesn’t make sense for heroic spirit Diarmuid to forever have the scar from when he impaled himself with his own spear during that one Holy Grail War, but dammit I want him to have a scar. For, um, aesthetic reasons. Especially if it features during sex. Especially if he can’t remember how he got it because 2)The lore says he wouldn’t remember the events of Zero but she would. And man, there’s some delicious angst potential in 2), but feel free to ignore that one if you’d rather they both kept their memories - I’m fine with both scenarios.)

Fate/Grand Order 
Lancelot of the Lake | Berserker (Fate/Grand Order), Lancelot of the Lake | Saber (Fate/Grand Order)

I love characters having to deal with different versions of themselves from different points in their own timelines, and this canon is so great for that (especially since the “younger” versions still have vague memories of their “future”). To be the same person, and yet so fundamentally alien…
How do these two get along? Do they try to avoid each other? Do they seek each others’ company? Do they try to kill each other? Who was summoned first, and do they get territorial when the other shows up? Do they have to take down a dragon together to save their Master before they learn to work as a team? Are the other knights of the round table there? Is Arturia there? How well do they deal with having two Lancelots around?
How do they communicate? (I’m oddly charmed by the Protagonist’s attempts to bond with his/her less articulate Berserkers, from taking them on picnics to giving them chocolates for Valentine’s just like everyone else, so I’m guessing he/she would step in as an interpreter, at least at first.) I’d like it if they somehow, against all odds, managed to hash out their issues with each other and learn to accept themselves, even if one half of the conversation is carried out entirely in growls!
And here’s the spoilery bit: what’s their relationship with Mash like? How much time passed between the Camelot singularity and their summoning in Chaldea? Or was one or both of them already present (even, perhaps, along for the ride, with a front-row seat for the big reveal)? (Gameplay/story segregation is in full effect here; plot says they weren’t there, story mechanics mean they totally could have been, so go with your heart.) She’s not really their son-slash-daughter, but she’s also not really NOT their son-slash-daughter, and the whole situation is just so gloriously awkward. Zerkalot’s “About he Grail” dialog line is a very cryptic “Gala… had”, and I so dearly want to know what he means by that. Could be as simple as “Oh yeah, the Holy Grail. Yeah, Galahad found it that one time”, but where’s the fun in that? Most Servants use that line to say what they’d wish for if they had the Grail, so that’s a possible tack. Did he somehow sense or guess the identity of the heroic spirit possessing Mash long before everyone else? Or did he fight by her side for weeks/months without ever realizing? I dunno, I just want those three to be an awkward sort-of-family, beyond the Dad jokes.

I really love this show and I especially love Axel. And I love Catherine despite her trying to kill him. I could always see the broken girl with PTSD in her and I was so sad to see her die. I don't even know how many times I watched the scene when she attacks him with that self-made spear in the cage, the way he shoves it away once and says 'Enough' as if he expects her to listen to him.

Prompt: Fix-it time! Mohamad saves her and they meet up with the group again? She needs no saving and finds the group by herself? And once they're back together, their arguing, her rage and fear and his power to actually protect her (together with Vanessa) lead to something new?
Prompt: The group decides against throwing Catherine and the others out of the hospital. Alliances and backstabbing for everyone!
Prompt: souldbond/trope-y stuff - The two of them end up with a soulbond that requires them to be close to each other. He can't throw her out because of that. Both of them are pretty pissed about the bond but that slowly changes.

I loved the relationship between Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor. The support and trust between them, the tense camaraderie. I kinda figured Taylor was part of the conspiracy early on which didn't take away anything from the scenes between him and Barnes. Their last scene together, after Barnes shot Taylor and pulled him out of the car wreck, was amazing. Barnes' grief and anger over his partner's betrayal, Taylor's belief in his mission. Taylor starting to call Barnes "Thomas", Barnes returning the favour and calling him "Kent" as he died.

Prompt: A post-movie AU in which Kent doesn't die. Maybe he's in jail for his crimes and Barnes gets him out for a mission and there are ... feelings?
Prompt: Kent's group kidnaps Barnes before the attack, trying to get information out of him. But Kent can't betray him completely, is kinda protective.

Jimmy MacElroy, Chazz Michaels, Katie Van Waldenberg

I love this goofy movie so very much but I love the characters an their interplay even more.

1: What the hell happens when Jimmy and Chazz land after the movie ends?  Was it a hallucination?  What even occurred?

2: Brotherly bonding!  This could be a missing scene or something that happens after the movie.  What does a movie night look like with these two?  

3: a Katie/Chazz/Jimmy committed poly situation, and all the weirdness that would entail. 

4: Katie and Jimmy getting closer, him proposing or her proposing!

5: Chazz becoming a big brother figure to Katie and Jimmy's offspring, them forming an extended close-knit family since all they have is each other (this would be an ideal way to write Christmas fic for them!) Basically every found family trope ever, please.

6: Chazz and Jimmy's training process for the next World Winter Sports Games.

7: Katie being badass and assertive as an assistant, with Chazz as her biggest advocate on the team.

8: They try another sport.  Doesn't even have to be a winter sport.  Just try to imagine Chazz and Jimmy synchronized swimming!

9: Katie's view on being part of Jimmy's life, and leaving her biological family behind.

10: Canon AU where Katie starts out as Chazz' coach and they take Jimmy under their wing after his adopted father all but disowns him.

2: Something meta-tastic.  Brian and Danny do Yuletide and are either the toast of the fest or become an object of horror!  Brian and Danny try to figure out fanfiction and one of them becomes fannishly passionate?

3: So we know what made Danny decide to go with dance over ninjadom - what set him on the path of trying to become the world's best lover (according to him)?  

4: A day in the life of slightly-competent galaxy-and-time-roaming crimefighters, successful or not.

5: Anything based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvLz5kCVIss">6969.</a>  Cracky or goofy post-or-mid-video.  Maybe Brian and Danny have to do it to save the world?  Heck, even go bittersweet with it or uber-serious.  Maybe Dan accidentally killed the future by reintroducing sex to it!  Maybe the present he comes back to is ruined by what he did in the future?  Maybe he feels bad about forgetting Kristen's name?  Maybe Brian left his teacup in the future? 

6: Arin/Danny or Brian/Danny slash, as stabby and/or ridiculous or PWP-heavy as you want to make it.

7: Anything based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%20v=Utj8DoSjfqo&amp;list=PLcIDqHah6ZnCp48Mixo9UvT505e7itqp7">Any of the videos</a>.  There are lots to choose from!

8: What's Arin like when he's not chasing after Danny and Brian?  What does the SAP DO with its extra time?  Maybe there's a reason they're so pro-chastity.  I'd like to see if you can make them more sympathetic!

9: Ninja Brian backstory!  We don't know anything about him, at least not as much as we know about Danny.  What was he like when he was younger?  What's he like in his off-hours?  What's he like when he's doing something super-mundane? Do some world-building! 

10: Brian has a vague idea as to how Brian and Danny met once upon a time (A backstory Dan doesn't even remember writing); There's also an animated short that was shown at the last string of Rock Hard Tour concerts that explores this idea.  But what's your take?  How did they meet?

This is a very old favorite of mine, and I've enjoyed it ever since I was in high school.  Alternate histories, wild aus, alternate pairings and anything in between is what I'm looking for.

1: Juliet escapes her marriage to Paris, asking Mercuito to help her out.  The two of them either become friends or fall in love during the long trip to (general) safety.

2: Space AUs or Fairy Tale/mythological retellings of the canon.

3: AUs where Juliet is the only one to survive.  Five things fics. What if one little thing had changed?  What would she be like as an older woman, a mother, a nun, a spinster?  And what would change if Mercutio were alive?  Would he have gone on to become something or someone different?  

4: both characters (or just one of them) as ghosts haunting Capulets and Montagues. 

5: Mercutio meeting Juliet as a child instead of a teenager.

6: Simple everyday character studies.  What DON'T we know about these three?

7: Juliet rises to become a lady warrior and assume control of the Capulet holdings.

8: Mercutio's wit and wisdom, and his impression of life in Verona.

1: Star before.  Who was she?  Who were all of the various hers that existed or might have existed before David and her conscription as the team's Wendy?

2: What about after?  Does she stay with Michael?  Is she able to accept her new, mundane life?  Can she accept the rigors of aging?  Of dying?  Does she become a mother and guardian beyond (likely) keeping an eye on Laddie?

3: Missing bits, hidden and lost scenes.

4: Star as the ringleader of the gang.  Would there be less desperation?  Moral improvements?  Less risky foolishness?

5: I am here for every single queer interpretation of her ever.  Does it add to or relieve her alienation?

6: Any and every kind of au you can bring to life.  Star heading a biker gang; Star running away with the circus; Star being Star, but somewhere else.

7: Star hanging around in Lucy's video store, developing a passion for film.  Alongside that - the march of time as seen through the world's transition from VHs rental to DVD rental to the loss of brick and mortar  stores.

3: Anything Meg-centric will please me.  Meg seeing Herbert's softer side.  Meg kicking ass and keeping them from fucking up.

4: Bride POV fic.  She's herself and yet not.  She's part of Meg, and yet not.  How does she handle this dichotomy?  Is there a world where she can, and can forge her own identity?  

5: Meg as a guiding force in the Bride's life from beyond - as a friendly spirit or ghost.

6: Dan and Herbert during their war years, or trying to live domestically after coming back to the states.

7: Anything that would involve heavy applications of the sweet, sweet crack and body horror these movies provide in dollops!

New Mutants 
Illyana Rasputin (New Mutants), Danielle Moonstar (New Mutants)

My favorite New Mutants stories are the Headmaster Magneto era, and I'd love to see some of him interacting with the kids, but I also love Dani/Rahne and, really, anything to do with Illyana. Dani is my favorite character. Honestly, anything relating to the classic New Mutants era would be wonderful - I don't care what characters you do or don't include.

Star Wars Legends: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords 
Kreia (KotOR2)

I would honestly be okay with receiving any KOTOR fanfic, for either version of KOTOR or even TOR, but Kreia is my absolute favorite character in Star Wars, and I would kill for a good fic about her.


Request 3 by Hexiva
Dungeons & Dragons (Roleplaying Game) 

I would love something that is set in the 4e default campaign setting, and/or something that concerns illithids or other mind flayers. Some of the stuff where D&amp;D intersects with Lovecraft.

We Bare Bears (TV) 

I love all the bears equally so I'd really like ensemble slice-of-life stories. Alternately feel free to pick a random AU or have them meet some famous bears of history/literature/etc. 

I love the bears best when they're playing off each other (and Chloe the awesome). I don't know what else to say but moar #bearstack please.

Milo Murphy's Law 
Milo Murphy

I'm happy with just about anything here as long as Milo's in the center of things being his usual calm self. Time travel hijinks? Bring on Cavendish and Dakota. Pre-show backstory with either Sara or Melissa? Go for it. Zack's past coming back to haunt him again? Why not? Or maybe a school story or just a wild adventure, or a glimpse of that Phineas &amp; Ferb crossover they keep teasing us with.

Wynd Family Series - Stephen Krensky 

I'd love to see the Wynds meet another magical family. Crossovers welcome or just expand on the magic in their world.

Alison, Edward, Jamie, Jennifer and Perry are the kids in a family with hereditary magical powers. The books are light magical adventures/mysteries in which the kids have to band together to save the day. I just love the entire family so I'd love to see either an ensemble adventure or focus on any member or members of the family.

The series is out-of-print but cheap used copies are available and all three books are available on Amazon Kindle.

My Two Dads 
Nicole Bradford, Michael Taylor, Joey Harris

Yes, I ship it. Michael/Joey, I mean. I'd love to see either Nicole playing matchmaker or maybe having a bet with the Judge about how long it would take them to figure it out. Or any other plot in tone with the series. 

On the off chance that you don't ship it, I'd be perfectly happy with a sitcom-esque plot with Nicole at the center. I'd appreciate it if you avoided some of the 80s gender stereotyping (especially relationship-wise) of the original, and keep it in tone with the original intended audience, but otherwise go wild.

Kitty Telefair Series - Florence Stevenson 
Kitty Telefair

A long out-of-print "gothic" series - 1970s urban fantasy before it was called that. Kitty is a member of a family of occultists, and does occasional stints on a television talk show. Mostly though, she deals with occult menaces of various sorts.

This is my long-shot fandom but I'd be happy with another case set in the 70s, what happened to her after the series, or maybe a time travel adventure to the present.

Asbjorn (Northmen: A Viking Saga), Inghean (Northmen: A Viking Saga)

No Thanks:
Slave worlds, demon-possession, mind control, prostitution, noncon, dubcon, character death, infidelity, love triangles/jealousy focus (I am far more fond of OT3ing it up), characters de-aged during the story (if you make one of the characters a child, make them “canon” children for that story if that makes sense), A/B/O, gangster/mob, noir settings, amnesia fics, loss of limb/amputations, mpreg, underage, gender swap, teacher/student stories, or focus on drug abuse or alcoholism. Regarding incest – I have exactly two sibling pairings that work there for me and I haven’t requested either fandom for this exchange, so please avoid that. Also, no parent/child pairings. Please no 2nd person or 1st person POVs except for the Innkeeper Chronicle request (enjoyed them in the past - just not in the mood this year for the other fandoms).  For M-rated fics, for triggering reasons I have to shy away from knife play/blood play/gun play (only in a sexual context – canon level plot/action violence is fine), scat, watersports, rape-as-fantasy-scenes, anal for M/F pairings, and any kind of direct blow in a sexual connotation even including spanking/flogging.

Yes Please:
Post-apocalypse fic, slice of life/domestic fic, epistolary stories, teamfics, found family, crossovers, AUs (particularly coffee shop, Black Jewels trilogy, daemons, steampunk/neo-Victorian, Sentinel/Guide, Old West, and Pacific Rim fusions), outsider POVs, supernatural elements, badass chicks and men who respect/lust after them for it, OT3s, fixit fics to bring back killed off characters, fics where characters have kids and are adorable parents, 5 and 1 style fics.  I’m definitely OK with an M-rating, and for smutty fics, I particularly love dirty talk, a clear top ordering their bottom around, hair-pulling, restraint i.e.: ropes/shibari/handcuffs/holding partner down, wall sex, shower sex, cramped vehicular sex, biting/marking (without major blood being drawn), mate bonds, “OMG we didn’t die” sex, and “sharing body heat” leading to sex.

Fandom Specific:
Tom Hopper pulled me into this teeny tiny fandom (No really – there are 7 fics. SEVEN. And I’ve written half of them LOL) after Black Sails moved him to the top of my fandom boyfriend list. I gotta admit, it’s such a terrible movie objectively, but it totally appeals to my love of questionable action movies.

We get all the Tom Hopper biceps you might hope for in his character (and the lead) Asbjorn, though sadly he never takes the shirt completely off. As the leader of the exiled and shipwrecked Vikings, he’s awesomely competent and has mad chemistry with the one female lead (in the entire film sadly), Inghean. She is a Scottish princess the Vikings kidnap in hopes of ransom only to discover her father prefers to see her dead than pay for her safe return. She also is the source of the one fantasy element in the film: an earth sense that warns her when the group is in danger.

All in all, I just desperately want a post-movie fic with these two. The movie ended so very abruptly, and there was so much more of the story hanging. How do they all survive the long boat? Do they ever find safety? Is it at the Viking encampment they hoped to find? Does Inghean’s earth sense end up more under control or cause people to see her as a witch? Will Inghean and Asbjorn EVER do more than stare at each other longingly? LOL

Fandom Specific:
Ilona Andrews basically owns my readerly soul LOL. I mainlined through everything they’ve written last fall &amp; have devoured every new book that has come out since them. The Innkeeper Chronicles series is definitely my fave though. Really what’s not to love about an intergalactic Bed and Breakfast? I put “any” for character choices because honestly I really love all of the characters in this story, including the inn itself, Gertrude Hunt which DEFINITELY feels like a character all on its own. Just FYI tho, I ship the canon ships, so please no Dina/Arland or Sean/Maude stories if at all possible.

So, prompt/concepts I’m excited about: I’d love to have a 1st POV fic ala the books (though from any character you like – Dina, of course, is always a win as the book’s POV character, but I’m game for a look into anyone’s head!), &amp; I’d like it mostly set in and around Gertrude Hunt since the inn is a delight. Domestic fic in particular would make me super happy here. We always see Dina in a panic, but rarely get those calm moments of life running like normal or even with a guest that ISN’T close to causing an intergalactic incident. Are Arland, Maude, and Helen visiting for a holiday? Have Dina &amp; Sean finally made it official &amp; started bonding Sean to the end? Is Orro in a tizzy? Does Caldenia have a visitor who ISN’T trying to claim a bounty for once? Of course, if you do want to write an actiony fic I’d be happy to read that as well. Seriously run wild – this series just makes me happy in general LOL

Oh! BTW, I would TOTALLY be thrilled to have a crossover with any of the other Ilona Andrews series as long as it’s taking place in the Innkeeper universe. I mean, it’s already canon that Edge verse characters have made it there, but what about a visit from Julie &amp; Derek ala the Kate Daniels books? Or one of Nevada’s sisters &amp; cousins from the Hidden Legacy books? I think that would be a TON of fun for sure. (Hell, now that I think about it – a crossover with any of the other fandoms I’ve requested would also be a blast. This fandom just totally works for crossover fics in general I think!)

Oh yeah, I shipped it. I shipped it HARD. Honestly, I’ve never quite gotten the appeal of Tom Hiddleston, but oh holy hells this movie convinced me! Conrad and Weaver’s chemistry was fantastic, and I loved how well they worked together. My competency kink was definitely tingling every single scene they had together. I think what I really want is post-movie fic for this one. Do they drift apart and find their way back to each other during another strange creature related incident? Do they join Monarch &amp; get read into the Godzilla insanity? Just give me these two confident badasses together facing the world after learning that it was so much bigger in some places than they ever knew.

Fandom Specific:
I both loved and hated this movie. Most of it was so right up my alley I could hardly stand it, but I have to admit I was disappointed by the way ladies were fridged right &amp; left, and that The Mage didn’t even merit a name. So, I want her story. Who is she really? I thought her to be Nimue, but I know some people see her as Guinevere. Could she be Morgana? I want to know who she is and why she risked so much for Arthur, especially if Merlin was dead and gone. Hell, who even was Merlin to her? Just a leader of her people or more? Feel free to ship her if you like! I’m game for Mage/Arthur or even Mage/Maggie or Mage &amp; one of the brothel girls. Femmeslash, as always, is definitely welcome. I’m game for the rest of the cast making appearances too, but she should be the focus. Just give me awesome Mage fic. That’s all I ask.

I am a sucker for people at war coping with the horrifying realities they are participants in, I am a sucker for comrades in arms coping together, I am a sucker for flash-in-the-pan friendships and romances that only last a moment or lifetime and are exactly what is needed right in that moment.

I would love to see more moments in-between. Corran is my favourite, a good start, but I will be so pleased to read about any and all of these hot shot pilot rebels and the important nothing moments that make up most of their time together &lt;3

I will jump at any chance to queer up the Star Wars Expanded Universe in any way, representation is my jam, but I'm perfectly happy with gen stories, and doubly so if they have casual no-big-deal diverse queer casts.

Earthsea - Ursula K. Le Guin 

You could write the weather report in this world and I would be so so so so so happy. Seriously. Worldbuilding, missing moments, long introspective character pieces, like anything. I love Ged, I love characters who flicker in and out like Vetch, Tenar's powerful outsider view of the gender dynamics of Earthsea are my favoured wisdoms, I ADORE Arren and everything about politics in Earthsea, and every word Tehanu thinks brings me a deep happy-sad satisfaction. Pick any moment or any tiny character or any side quest or any red herring wordbuilding clue that spiked your interest and I promise you I will adore hearing more. Ogion and his goats chilling? Yes. The childhood friend witch who tried to run off with Ged in the frozen northern Keep? YES. The ancestors of the ladies keeping the old house where the great ancient king once stayed in that one Tales of Earthsea ancient background side story?  YES!!! Something you COMPLETELY CAME UP WITH using this place and setting and with only tangential relations to the characters we know, be it millennia in the past during or before the reign of Erreth Akbe or centuries after when everyone we know is dead and gone, YES THIS IS GOOD TOO!!! I want it all.

As above, queer representation is my jam, but that doesn't need to mean romance- I'm perfectly happy with gen stories, and doubly so if they have casual no-big-deal diverse queer casts.

Code Name Verity Series - Elizabeth Wein

Some ideas, which you don't have to use: 

- Julie before the war. Julie growing up -- if you've read The Pearl Thief, feel free to include any canon you've gleaned from that; if you haven't, feel free to make up what you want.  
- Julie on missions during the war. Julie being smarter than her enemies. 
- Julie falling in love. Julie pretending to fall in love. Julie realizing too late that she's in love. 

Feel free to use any/all other characters from canon as you see fit; I've read all the books so I'm good there. I do very much love Julie/Maddie, and also Julie/Ellen (from the Pearl Thief), and also will gladly read gen or het or whatever you come up with.

Taboo (TV 2017) 
James Delaney, Zilpha Geary

When I saw Taboo, I was instantly like, oh boy, this is a Yuletide fandom. 

(Obviously this show is super fucked up, including but not limited to the, ah, explicit incest, so don't feel like you need to tread lightly with content.) 

I just want anything and everything about Delaney and Zilpha. Maybe scenes from each of their lives when they were separated when Delaney was in Africa. Maybe something from their earlier life, showing how they ended up taking their relationship to, uh, a different place.  Maybe Zilpha really isn't dead? 

Go ahead and use any of the other characters in the show, too.

If bad things happen to Zilpha, that's fine? It's canon, for certain. But I guess I'd prefer not to see explicit violence against her written out in great detail. 

Of all my requests, feel free to just get really heckin' weird with this one.

It has been ages since I've read these books but Phedre and Joscelin are my forever OTP and I would read any story about them. Here are some thoughts.

- Any sort of "missing moment" throughout canon
- We know they go on some of their own adventures after the original trilogy/during the Imriel books. What are their adventures?
- Sexytimes, obviously. Of any kind. 
- Quiet moments at home? Loud moments of court intrigue? 
- Young Phedre, headstrong and brash. Older Phedre, still much the same, but wiser. Phedre and Joscelin growing old together, content, beautiful.

I am a super huge fan of Hyacinthe/Phedre/Joscelin, if you want to use him in any way, too. 

As always, feel free to toss in other characters from throughout canon, and clearly, this is another canon where things can get dark and if that's the direction you want to go in, that's fine. (I would prefer not to read about non-consensual violence against women. Consensual kink/BDSM play is fine.)

Cynster Family Saga - Stephanie Laurens 
Sylvester "Devil" Cynster, Honoria Cynster

I’d love some sort of an outsider’s point of view of their relationship (and it can be at any point in time). A servant’s point of view, Lady Osbalderstone’s point of view, their children’s point of view … whatever really. I for one, would think it would be hilarious to see the thoughts of the servants about certain happenings that take place at the Place in The Untamed Bride (which I know isn’t technically part of the Cynster Family Saga books but does feature the Cynsters heavily). And if you’ve read the book, you know what I mean. Alternatively, I’d like something about Devil’s and Honoria’s thoughts and feelings when they might have to worry or fear about their children (for instance, in By Winter’s Light when Sebastian and Michael are with their cousins, stuck in a storm, where Lucilla is assisting with a birth of a baby).

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Roberto Nicholas, Hiraga Josef Kou, Lauren Di Luca

This show was one wild trip, but definitely never boring for a second. Maybe it was the cocaine. Anyway, the cracky enjoyment of the incredibly paced anime aside, I genuinely grew very attached to our investigator duo. Something about their mutual high respect and affection for each other (which doesn’t mean they won’t drag each other in public for the occasional short coming re: science or understanding human relationships, which only goes to show they are true friends imho) is just very touching, and seeing them stumble into murder conspiracies every second Thursday and solving them with casual grace, common sense and some liberally applied Catholicism was always a joy to watch.

So I would absolutely love a case fic for them! Go wild with conspiracies, red herrings and out-there motives, last minute twists, fake exorcisms and deii ex machinae! If you have any local trivia to share, please do, because casefics set in the real world (or the heightened reality this show is set in, rather) are the ideal opportunity for that and I really enjoy reading about other places.

However, I would equally like just a fic about them hanging out together when off-assignment, in case you’re not up for murders and mayhem - just a nice day where neither of them is about to get murdered for once, you know what I mean.

For these two, I like everything from just their close relationship in canon to a more definitively romantic take, so please feel free to go with either.

Also, I very much like Lauren and his friendship with Hiraga versus his tolerance for Roberto, so him making an appearance of some sort is also always welcome!

Aldnoah.Zero (Anime & Manga) 
Kaizuka Yuki, Marito Kouichirou, Mazuurek (Aldnoah.Zero), Yagarai Souma

Note: for this fandom, I’m also fine if you don’t include all the requested characters! Focussing on any of them will make me a happy reader :D

Yes it’s been three years and I’m still hung up about this show, mostly about the older generation of the UFE side to be specific. I loved literally everybody among the Wadatsumi/Deucalion crew a metric ton, and how they all just got along so well without any unnecessary drama was just very refreshing somehow.

Really just anything with them interacting would be great! I have a particular soft spot for Marito and Yagarai, no matter if as friends or lovers. Their utter unshakeable trust in each other and supportive relationship developed so naturally and the strong sense of familiarity their interaction conveys was something for sure. Staying together is a strong (or main) motivator for them to fight (in Yagarai’s case, to enlist in the first place), and there’s the fact that Yagarai is one of two people who recognise Marito’s exceptional qualities even when he’s at his lowest point in life post-Tanegashima. Yuki being the other one, of course, and her friendship with and loyalty to Marito is just great. So anything about them, both during the series or after, would be lovely!

Also, any mundane adventure including Count Eastercake of Arabia Mazuurek would also be much appreciated! I ended up really liking this accidental double agent and his generally cheerful disposition. I thought it was a bit unfortunate that we never saw him interact with the ones who actually bested him in combat, so I’d love to have him meet Marito and Yuki, seeing how he seems to remain on Earth post-canon and clearly enjoys befriending former enemies and learning about their lives. (Also if you’re up for a challenge - truth is, I’d really love to see anything involving Mazuurek and Yuki in a more shippy way. It’s a one-man rowboat kind of ship, I know, but they actually might make a nice couple! They have quite a lot in common - both are Inaho’s biggest fans, both are great with children, both care aggressively for those around them (with more passion than advisable in an all-out war), both are upbeat and warm people who can ruthlessly get things done if necessary and are a force to be reckoned with. TL;DR: I’d love to see any take of Yuki remaining utterly nonplussed by his quick changing between being genuinely sweet and smugly arrogant. Those voice switches, mate.)

モノノ怪 | Mononoke (Anime & Manga) 

Mononoke was an absolutely unique experience, especially because we learned so little about the main character, and so much is still a mystery. The series lends itself to casefics in particular, the wandering exorcist/medicine seller appearing across centuries just at the right time, and seeing how the people affected react to him and his seemingly very grey morality when it comes to saving humans. Mononoke plays a lot with absolutely unreliable narration and people’s lies, which always makes for an interesting narrative. Also, the challenge is of course capturing the surreal style and atmosphere of the anime, so if you are up for a more experimental request, I think this might be the choice for you!

While a look at how he and Hyper are connected and work together is very interesting as well, I think a spelled out origin story would take away some of the charm of this character. Also, please no shipping between those two!

Fantastic Four (Comicverse) 
Valeria Richards (Comics), Franklin Richards (Comics)

I love the FF.  I especially love Valeria, Franklin, and the other Future Foundation kids.  Kids are a tricky thing to pull off in comics, but Franklin and Val are capable enough to hold their own.  They also have a sibling relationship that can run either antagonistic and envious or all in, which feels very accurate to me.  Both of the Future Foundation runs have great moments for them, but I particularly like the end of Hickman's FF and the Dark Reign: Fantastic Four mini. I'd love anything that focuses on their sibling relationship or that features them teaming up! Any/all other Fantastic Four/Future Foundation characters are also great and I'd be super happy for them to be included.

I have such a weakness for Regency period stories and magic and girls being smart, so this series always feels like it was written for me.  I love the bantery romance.  I love the magical elements.  I definitely love the Regency trappings - the balls, the dancing, the weird etiquette and dialogue.  Wrede and Stevermer do such a great job giving all of the characters their own voices and making the girls clearly the heroines, even while keeping much of the period-specific sensibilities.  I didn’t request Thomas or James but they’re certainly welcome if you so choose!

Champions (Comics)

My other Marvel faves.  Mark Waid's Champions run was a little hit or miss for me, but the friendship between these three was definitely a stand-out element.  I love that they're going through so much of the same things so differently (highschool, parents, superheroing).  I really enjoy seeing them come through for each other and also seeing them relate/not relate to older heroes.  Note: Gen or romance are both fine for this, but if it's the latter, I definitely lean more towards Sam/Kamala (Samala?) than any of the other combinations.  Although I was definitely intrigued by Miles's apparent interest in a Sam/Kamala/Miles love triangle in the All-New All-Different Avengers Annual, so feel free to play around with that

So the Robot Devil's always been my favorite minor Futurama character, but he's so underutilized in fic! I will take just about anything--trying to make a deal with someone (successfully or unsuccessfully), the ups and downs of running Robot Hell, additional run-ins with Fry or Leela after the events of "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings" (or set during it), how exactly he wound up granting Calculon his UNHOLY ACTING TALENT, etc. I also think he and Bender play off of each other really well, particularly given the fact that Bender's evilness shocks even him, so you're welcome to explore that in any way you see fit.

The Simpsons 
Sideshow Bob

Bob's my favorite Simpsons character by far, but I really hate what the show's done with him over the last decade or two. (Well, I hate what the show's done with just about every character over that timespan.) I'm less interested in Sideshow Bob as a deranged psychopath and more interested in Sideshow Bob as a guy who perpetually struggles with the notion of forgiveness instead of revenge. He's bitter about a lot of things, some of it justly, and some of it unjustly, but he's still capable of emotions like guilt.
There are really a lot of ways you could go about this. Bob and Krusty, at any point in their lives (first meeting, during the time they were working together, after Krusty was framed, after Bob tried to kill him, etc.), Bob and Bart (any time after Bob was sent to jail the first time, including the times that they worked together)--hell, I'd even be interested in the two Sideshows, Bob and Mel, getting to interact more! Maybe even Bob and his brother Cecil in jail squabbling over who gets the lead in a prison production of "The Mikado" or something like that. (The more high culture--or at least highbrow culture--you can work into it, the better. He's basically evil Frasier with more hair, after all.)

DNW: References to Bob's faceswapping or genetic modification. It's not a squicky thing (well ok, maybe a bit with the whole "cutting your face off" thing), I just really dislike the whole premise of those episodes because they're too farfetched.

They're both absolute bastards in one sense, and a lot of fun in another, so I really don't want to see either one get turned into a punching bag regardless of your personal proclivities, fair author. I'm amused by the whole notion of Vidal writing characters into his novels that are extremely insulting or unflattering caricatures of Buckley, so something based off of that would probably be fun, but really, anything would be fine. Incredibly awkward meetings at other social events, the whole sad history of Buckley eventually flipping out during their televised debate, really, it's your call.

The Administration - Manna Francis 
Val Toreth, Keir Warrick, Jean-Paul Baptiste Carnac

Anything, explicit or not - if you offered these three, then you know what they're like together. I don't care what you come up with as long as they stay in character. There can never be enough Administration stories! Throw in Leo Warrick, or Carl Ruiz if you want – I love them all. Feel free to add Sara as long as there's no het sex. I've read the most recent book so it's fine to include any plot points from it as I won't be spoiled.

NOTE: I don't have a letter this year, but here are some of my likes/dislikes-Please keep in mind that these prompts are for guidance purposes only. Most of my likes are not shared by a lot of writers. I certainly don’t expect someone to go outside their comfort zone just because it’s something I would enjoy reading. And even though I may dislike something in general, I always keep an open mind. Well-written fluff or crack will not go unappreciated. Most of all, write what makes you happy. I know I’ll enjoy it too. And thank you so much for taking the time to write me a story.

Likes: I really like slash/p0rn (explicit or implied) and dark themes, hate-sex, rough-sex, sex-up-against-the-wall, non-con/dub-con, handcuffs/bound-hands, blindfolds, hair pulling and just about any of the different 'plays' (breath, knife, blood, etc.).

Dislikes: silly fluff or crack, sappy romance, any of the characters behaving out of character (without a good reason for it), het sex and explicit mention of girly parts (although I can’t see that happening in any of these fandoms with these characters).

Don't Series - Jack L Pyke 
Jack Harrison | Martin, Gray Raoul, Kes (Don't Series)

Not many people are aware of this series unless you like very dark slash. It’s a great series with lots of potential side stories. It would be a challenge to write something with these characters since they’re all so complex. Kes is a new character in the latest book. There's some sexual tension going on between "Martin" and Kes but it's never realized. A missing scene or AU where they do get together would be really hot.

Dark Edge Of Honor - Aleksandr Voinov & Rhi Etzweiler 
Mike | Andrew Miguel Villanova, Sergei Stolkov, Pat (Dark Edge Of Honor)

This book has been out for several years but I only just 'read' it last year as an audio book. Although the main pairing is Mike and Sergei, I think the relationship between Sergei and Pat has a lot of potential for exploration because of Pat being Sergei's torturer. Sergei is clearly afraid of Pat when they meet later in the story - some dark hate-sex might work as an alternate scene. Or, perhaps a missing scene during the torture part. We know Mike intervened, but what exactly was said between Mike and Pat? And I don't think it's too far-fetched to imagine these characters in a threesome at some later point after the actual story ends, when Mike is supposedly retired. Mike knows so many 'secrets' that he has to be a target for kidnappers/interrogators. Perhaps Pat is sent to Mike to ensure that he won't ever be able to reveal what he knows.

The Good Place (TV) 
Chidi Anagonye, Eleanor Shellstrop

So Season 1 was just a roller coaster of fun and twists and I’m so pumped as we head into season 2! By the end I was in love with the whole five-some of Chidi/Eleanor/Tahani/Jason/Janet and I can’t wait to see what they do when they’re in the know.

I’m still shipping Chidi/Eleanor like crazy, though. Maybe more now.

Elements I like about the source:
--The high-concept nature of the show
--The possibility of in-canon and fanfiction AUs of all the ways Michael could have attempted to twist them (I do not consider these mundane AUs)
--The humor and heart of the five as they interact
--The behind-the-scenes fun we’re already seeing of the non-human denizens of The Good Place

Prompts:
--Tell me more about all the ways Chidi and Eleanor found each other as they went through all of Michael’s failed attempts.
--How did that first time come about in the Medium Place? Was it different every time or were there things in common?
--Now that Eleanor knows she's developed feelings for Chidi in the past - does she actively work toward that, or does she try to ignore it?

Ships:
--Eleanor/Chidi
--Tahani &amp; Eleanor (and Eleanor’s flirtatiousness with Tahani)
--Jason/Janet
--The five-some

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (TV 2017) 
Miriam "Midge" Maisel

I was blown away by this pilot. There’s so much to explore about Midge and her life and the stand-up comedy life she’s about to experience. I want so much more of it, and there’s no information about when the next episodes will air. So if you only have the pilot to go by during the writing period, that’s fine with me!

Elements I like about the source:
--Midge and her perfectionism. It was played as tragic in the face of the dissolution of her marriage, but I look forward to seeing how it helps her as she goes forward.
--Her father, Abe. They seem to have a close relationship, but not without its expectations and conflicts.
--Susie. Who is this woman with her lonely apartment and the hints of her failed dreams?
--Imogene. Is she the fair-weather best friend, or more?

Prompts:
--I’d love to see more funny Midge in the past and how it helps her in the future
--Abe and Midge growing up
--More about Susie’s past as she helps Midge
--Imogene ends up seeing Midge perform, by accident

Ships:
--Midge/stand-up
--Midge &amp; Susie

Emily Locke, Teddy (Powerless), Beatriz da Costa | Green Fury (Powerless)

Oh, my poor canceled show. I saw the original pilot at Comic Con 2016 (it was funnier, aaaggggghhhhh) but I stuck by the show in its new format. I thought the cast was really starting to click! I have seen the 3 unaired episodes, but if you haven’t, you don’t need to reference them. On the other hand, use them if you like!

Elements I like about the source:
--The conceit of regular people in a superpowered world. People who can still make a difference.
--Emily’s ambition and sweetness, Jackie’s acerbic wit with a hidden heart, Ron’s excitement about things, Wendy’s weirdness, Teddy’s everything.
--I really enjoyed Green Fury’s few appearances and wanted more!
--I can see the three requested characters in any combination, shippy or friendship. Don’t put them in a triangle, though, please.

Prompts:
--Emily or Teddy (or both) get to help Green Fury save the day!
--Emily or Teddy run across Beatriz in her secret identity. What is that? (Could be the comics version, but I’m fine with anything).
--Teddy starts seeing Emily in a new light after she helps Green Fury with stopping a crime.

Dance Academy 
Kat Karamakov, Grace Whitney

God, this is such a cute, silly, endearing show. I don't even care how absurdly outside of the target audience age range I am, I love it. So bizarrely addictive, and the characters, though they occasionally act like the bratty teenagers they are, are all really watchable and rootable (root-for-able?) in their own ways. I love Kat's neuroses and her continued struggles to figure out just who she is and who she wants to be independent of her famous and accomplished parents. I find Grace alternately insufferable and sympathetic and fun, really an asshole at times but clearly with her own issues and a desperation to form bonds that she just doesn't know how to form.

I would love femslash for these two. Maybe it's kind of a random pairing, but I like rivalships, and they have kind of an interesting history in their sort of competition for Tara's friendship in Season 2. They also have somewhat similar pasts, with wealthy, famous, absentee parents, dancing as the family business, etc, as well as both of them being somewhat unsure about their own feelings towards dancing and whether they each do it because they're good at it or because they really love it.

So I was watching the final episode, and got to the scenes with Grace and Kat talking in the hospital waiting room while waiting for news on Tara, and Grace admitting that she'd thought she wanted Tara to be injured but now that she's seen it happen she really doesn't want this, and then later when Kat is freaking out and then Grace comforts her... aaaaaaaaaand shipping it. 

As in FYI, I haven't seen the movie, but I'm okay with being spoiled, so whether you want to use anything from it or ignore it is fine either way.

Some ideas, feel free to use any or none of these:

-Expanding on that comfort scene - comfort-sex, or even just something with them sticking together through the night and talking about their crazy families and dancing and whatever else

-Set during that "8 months later" montage, Grace emailing Kat photos from her travels, maybe Kat meeting up with Grace somewhere along the way.

-Trying to figure out how to tell Tara about their relationship later, after the little reunion/dance center dedication?

-Something set during Season 2, during that whole push-pull with Tara? Hate!sex between these two could be epic. 

-Grace looked so perplexed and lost at seeing the others all together during Sammy's memorial, like she knew she wanted to be a part of the group but didn't know how to go about it. That's something I'd love to see explored more, especially with Kat who is so friendly and outgoing and seems to build friendships and connect to people pretty easily when she wants to.

Stuff I like in general: romance, friendship, hurt/comfort, explicit sex (but if that's not your jam, no worries, any rating is fine), fiction tropes like stuck somewhere together or bed-sharing or amnesia or thought-you-were-dead, codependence, intense loyalty and devotion, missing scenes or post-canon, UST that eventually gets resolved, taboo relationships or just general we-shouldn't-be-doing-this.

Space: Above and Beyond 
Nathan West, Cooper Hawkes

Oh man, I love this show. When I win the lottery the first thing I'm doing is funding a revival of it. Sadly, many of the old archives that were packed with fic are gone now, so I'm always desperate for more!

West and Hawkes start out in very different places - West is your sort of average boy-next-door type who is kind of single-mindedly focused on finding his girlfriend and has some bitterness towards In Vitros because he blames them for he and his girlfriend being separated, while Hawkes has never really had any type of family or structure in his life, so he's rather brash and reckless and initially uncaring about what anyone else thinks. The two of them butt heads early on but grow to really care about each other, as all of the characters do for one another, and in the end they're the last two left standing.

I would love some West/Hawkes slash - I've just always really loved the development of their relationship through the series; how they go from hating each other, resenting each other, to a slow-building friendship and mutual respect, to having genuine affection for one another. I love Hawkes' wonder at West (such as the scene in which Neil dies and Hawkes watches West grieve with this curious sort of fascination), West eventually sort of taking Hawkes under his wing, and that it's the two guys who began the war hating each other who survive the last episode alone together.

Vansen is my other favorite character - I didn't request her and it's absolutely not a requirement, but feel free to include her, or any of the other characters, in any capacity. 

Some ideas, feel free to use any or none of these - pretty much anything involving these two surviving together would be wonderful:

-How do they get through the loss of the 58th together, either the immediate aftermath and West dealing with having regained Kylen at the same time that he lost Vansen, Damphoose, and Wang while Hawkes is figuring out how to adjust to the first family he's ever really known being totally torn apart; how they manage to continue fighting while leaning on each other, how their relationship, whether friendship or something more, continues after they suffer this huge loss. I would totally go for some grief!sex / comfort!sex, and/or them realizing their feelings for one another and acting on their mutual attraction in the midst of dealing with their loss.

-Searching for (and finding?) Vansen and Damphoose. Either going AWOL together to find those two (reminiscent of West going after Kylen and then Hawkes and Vansen going after him in The Farthest Man From Home) or somehow convincing Ross to allow them to mount a rescue mission.

-Something else incorporating their close relationship with Vansen or checking up on McQueen, maybe something touching on Kylen being rescued and what that means for West, and/or them going back to Earth together. 

-After Neil's death, Hawkes trying to be supportive and help West and having absolutely no idea how to do it, but trying his best.

-AU set during another war from history - soldiers during WWII or the Vietnam war, trying to navigate their feelings for one another in an era when it's much less accepted, dealing with most of their unit going MIA perhaps.

Stuff I like in general: romance, friendship, hurt/comfort, explicit sex (but if that's not your jam, no worries, any rating is fine), fiction tropes like stuck somewhere together or bed-sharing or amnesia or thought-you-were-dead, codependence, intense loyalty and devotion, missing scenes or post-canon, UST that eventually gets resolved, taboo relationships or just general we-shouldn't-be-doing-this.

Beverly Hills 90210 (1990) 
Brenda Walsh (Beverly Hills 90210), Dylan McKay (Beverly Hills 90210), Brandon Walsh (Beverly Hills 90210), Roy Randolph (Beverly Hills 90210)

The nostalgia show of my heart! I still watch the reruns with some regularity and there's so much of it that's just so silly and ridiculous but I still love it so, so much. I'm especially partial to the Brenda Years, as she was my fave no matter how bitchy or OTT she got with her melodrama. Loved her on again/off again friendship with Kelly and the constant push/pull with Dylan (I never bought Dylan/Kelly as a couple, too much of a Brenda/Dylan shipper to the core). Season 2 Dylan was my favorite flavor of him, but despite how much I loved Brenda/Dylan, I also really liked his relationship with Toni. The destruction of Dylan and Brandon's friendship in Season 5 was a bummer, but I did really love the intensity with which Dylan trusts Brandon right up until he left in Season 6, and Brandon's loyalty to Dylan in return.

Other ships I enjoyed: Brandon/Kelly, David/Val (I loved Val a lot in general - I didn't nominate her, but if you want to work her into the story, feel free - I'd especially love to know what Val and Brenda's friendship must be like) 

When it comes to post-series, I don't consider the 90210 reboot to be canon, so I'd prefer everything from that show to be ignored (also, feel free to ignore Dylan's return to the show towards the end of the series).

Anyway, tell me anything about any of these guys, in any combination. I didn't nominate Roy Randolph and he's not someone I would've initially thought of requesting, but I was so oddly charmed to see his name on the fandom list, so I'm totally down to read about him too. 

A few prompts, feel free to use any or none of these:

-Brenda/Dylan after Toni's death - how Dylan ends up in London and living with Brenda, what their relationship is like as Brenda tries to help Dylan through his grief, eventually turning into something more. And what happens to the cat??

-Brandon/Dylan - fumbling sexual escapades in high school, Brandon trying to over-analyze everything while Dylan is chill and all "whatever, I don't do conformity!" about it. 

-Want to go incest? Brenda/Brandon - they always seemed to skirt around the edges of flirtation (remember that crazy ass "Brandon" song from the Senior Breakfast in which Brenda and co sang about Brandon's love life??). 

-Brandon/Brenda/Dylan - during high school, Jim and Cindy out of town, the three of them are hanging on the couch, Brandon breaks his no drinking rule and things get a little too friendly... Or sometime after Brandon's left the show, he goes to visit Brenda and Dylan in England, perhaps he still mourning his relationship with Kelly or just generally feeling a little lost or out of place with his life, Dylan and Brenda try to buck him up.

-Brenda/Roy Randolph - what <i>did</i> happen that night when she came to his house to ask for a second chance on her audition?

Stuff I like in general: romance, friendship, hurt/comfort, explicit sex (but if that's not your jam, no worries, any rating is fine), fiction tropes like stuck somewhere together or bed-sharing or amnesia or thought-you-were-dead, codependence, intense loyalty and devotion, missing scenes or post-canon, UST that eventually gets resolved, taboo relationships or just general we-shouldn't-be-doing-this.

I would love to read a story about the relationship between two or more of these characters. I prefer happy or positive stories, please, alternatively a story that has a lot of character depth and doesn't make a villain out of anyone.

Here's a few ideas!

1.) What if Leah liked Mercy? Romantically, in a purely physical way, sisterly, motherly... How would that have changed things?

2.) What made Bran believe that Ben was salvageable and allow him to come to the US? Did he keep an eye on Ben and his progress?

3.) Mercy and Bran being romantically involved, oh my! Perhaps in a trio with Leah?

4.) Bran has some sort of showdown with his wolf, comes out on top and finds that he can dare an emotional relationship with Leash. What happens?

5.) Ben adores Mercy - the books says so. Show me a few instances of it that surprised both Ben and Mercy!

Belsomra "Cats and Dogs" Commercial 

This is my favorite commercial. Maybe because I'm a cat person without a cat. (I love dogs, too). Or because the anamorphic Title characters are freakin' adorable. It's just so sweet and happy-making, except for the little Wake dog, who just wants to play with the Sleep kitty, and doesn't mean to keep the woman up all night.

Tell me more about their lives. What's keeping the woman up at night? Is there stress in her relationship with whoever's under the covers with her? Do the pets get along when the woman isn't trying to sleep? What's the deal with the neighbor dog and owner?

If you're inclined to crossovers, I'd love to see other medication (or otherwise) ad characters appear. Ditto for animals from memes or internet famous pets i.e Ceiling Cat and Grumpy Cat or Monty. (Would that be Real Pet Fic?)

Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (2003)

Hello! Please see my YT letter for more details about my likes/dislikes. Here below are some prompts! (Plus DNWs at the bottom.)

- What if Leto had asked Ghanima for help when she confronted him after he went out to the desert at night with Stilgar in Ep.2? Would anything have gone differently? Would Leto have not chosen the Golden Path? Would they have chosen it together?

- Hurt/comfort and protectiveness are my jam. What if one of them (maybe because of poison/sabotage) at one point ended up looking like they're in danger of possession? What does the other do? I want to see them going to the ends of the world for each other.

- Anything about them growing up and always being there for each other, with added shenanigans arising from them being pre-born. Bonus points for exploring their relationship with Irulan and/or Alia.

- A crackier version of the above - they must have been pretty creepy kids, right? How does the house staff/guards react to pre-born kids shenanigans? External POV welcome!

- Ghanima is just a little bit faster and a little more ruthless in her plot to avenge Leto's death. When Leto comes back, Ghanima has uncovered the Corrino's plot and Alia's abomination and risen to the throne. I just want to see revenge-driven!Ghanima, devastated by her brother's death, and then her joy and relief at having him back.

- Any fix-it for the Leto-turns-into-a-giant-worm thing. I liked it just fine in canon, but I'd also like it if one of my faves did not turn into a giant worm.

- Time Travel! Leto and Ghanima travel back in time to the beginning of Children of Dune, when both their parents are alive. Do they try to save Alia? Their parents? I'd love to see how everyone deals with them treating Irulan a bit like a mom (especially Irulan's!).

DNW:  character death unless it's temporary, unprompted pairings, crossdressing, genderswap, F/m, humiliation (I have a massive embarrassment squick, so characters being publicly embarrassed or humiliating themselves is a big no-no), M/f, fluff for the sake of fluff, domestic/curtain!fic, graphic non-con (but mentions of past non-con are fine, same for characters being threatened. I'm okay with reading about it if it's part of a plot point), Mundane or Settings AUs (Coffeeshop/High School/etc. AUs), infidelity unless it's part of a rocky start for the get-together of an OT3, PWP, kidfic, second person POV, festive fic.

- AU, Kieren and Simon are at the same facility during Kieren’s treatment (maybe they never let Simon go, and kept experimenting on him?). Kieren discovers him, or they end up knowing each other in some way. What happens?

- AU, after his dad kicks him out, Simon doesn’t call the Undead Liberation Army and roams instead. He ends up in Roarton.

- Post-canon, Kieren slowly comes back to life. How do they both react? Or alternatively, even more post-canon, Simon starts to come back to life. How does he cope? How does Kieren help?

- “You could be great! If you could just be a normal person for two seconds!” What is it in particular that exasperates Kieren? What does he think of Simon? If you want a more humorous take on it, give me Simon who constantly slips into messiah mode in the most disparate situations, and Kieren looking into the camera like he’s on The Office.

- When Gus drags Kieren out of his house to bring him to the cemetery in Ep. 6, what if Simon didn’t remain hidden, but made up his mind to free Kieren instead? Do they run away together, from both Roarton and the ULA? Do they stay? I would love something that explored the anger and frustration that we could see building in Kieren when his parents were about to send him back to the Norfolk facility.

- Simon has never been afraid of the HVF, but that was before he started dating the brother of one of its members. I want to see Jem going to ridiculous lengths to make it clear to Simon that if he ever hurts her brother, she still remembers how to use an undead as target practice.  

DNW:  character death unless it's temporary, unprompted pairings, crossdressing, genderswap, F/m, humiliation (I have a massive embarrassment squick, so characters being publicly embarrassed or humiliating themselves is a big no-no), M/f, fluff for the sake of fluff, domestic/curtain!fic, graphic non-con (but mentions of past non-con are fine, same for characters being threatened. I'm okay with reading about it if it's part of a plot point), Mundane or Settings AUs (Coffeeshop/High School/etc. AUs), infidelity unless it's part of a rocky start for the get-together of an OT3, PWP, kidfic, second person POV, festive fic.

Six of Crows Series - Leigh Bardugo 
Inej Ghafa, Kaz Brekker, Nina Zenik, Matthias Helvar

Hello! Please see my YT letter for more details about my likes/dislikes. Here below are some prompts! (Plus DNWs at the bottom.)

- Kaz being a scheming ruthless bastard. He's smarter than you, and you don't know it yet, but you're about to find out. Any moment during canon, pre-canon or post-canon.

- Any fix-it for Matthias' death. In particular, I'd love to see Nina and Matthias embarking in their mission of bringing peace between the Fjerdans and the Grisha. "We'll go together, Matthias. We'll be spies. Genya will tailor us and we'll go to Fjerda together. I'll wear all the ugly knitted vests you want." Please make it happen!

- Nina's backstory! I want to see her past as a soldier, I am so fascinated by a “magical” army, and how the different types of Grisha talents are used in battle. Especially Nina! Give me all the grittiness of Nina in battle!

- Post-canon. Inej comes back to Ketterdam and Kaz after her first mission against slavers. I'd love some smut (clothed sex!), but just feelings and Kaz being constipatedly adorable is also fine.

- Alternatively from the prompt above, external POV fic from a new member of the Dregs who has not met the Wraith yet.

- Matthias' POV of capturing Nina and the following shipwreck. How was it for him to fall in love with a Grisha? I loved how taken aback he was by Nina's attitude in the flashbacks. (Would prefer if the fic stopped before Nina's "betrayal").

- Kaz and touch-starvation. He can't stand to be touched, but lack of human contact weighs on everyone after a while. Bonus points for he and Inej working on it post-canon.

DNW: character death unless it's temporary, unprompted pairings, crossdressing, genderswap, F/m, humiliation (I have a massive embarrassment squick, so characters being publicly embarrassed or humiliating themselves is a big no-no), M/f, fluff for the sake of fluff, domestic/curtain!fic, graphic non-con (but mentions of past non-con are fine, same for characters being threatened.

Madness (Manga) 
Kyou (Madness), Airishuu Izaya Luke

Hello! Please see my YT letter for more details about my likes/dislikes. Here below are some prompts! (Plus DNWs at the bottom.)

- AU, Madness finds Izaya prior to Kyou's apparent death. What happens? I'd love to read about Kyou's conflicted feelings (or him not understanding why he's having feelings in the first place), and trying to balance keeping Izaya safe and leading Madness at the same time. I sort of headcanon that prior to disbanding, Madness members either hunted together/in groups, or had some sort of headquarter.

- Anything from Kyou's POV. I'm interested in how he feels his bloodlust and pleasure in killing, both pre-canon and during canon. I love characters being unrepentant about the terrible things they do! And how does Izaya fit into it?

- Miyabi and Kyou role reversal AU: he is the one that after meeting Izaya and falling in love betrays the leader of Madness, Miyabi. He thinks that Izaya is dead, but little does he know that Izaya's being kept hostage by the Church of Ruka to buy his brother's silence about the chips. Reverse!canon events unfold.

- Time Travel! Post-canon, Izaya travels back in time to pre-canon time, when Madness is still active. He now has to a) find his boyfriend, b) convince him to stop killing, and c) get him to have his head checked and chip removed.

- What's it like to love a monster? I feel like we don't get a lot of insight into why Izaya loves Kyou as he is, rather than just the parts of amnesiac!Kyou that he can still see in present!Kyou. And I got the impression that at the end of the series, the Kyou that comes back is both amnesiac!Kyou and Madness!Kyou rolled together. How does older!Izaya react to both of them?

- Anything post-canon. How was Izaya changed by his adventure? When Kyou and co. come back, how do they settle down? Do any of them ever face danger again? Would Izaya be more ready to fight, and Kyou less bloodthirsty?

DNW:  character death unless it's temporary, unprompted pairings, crossdressing, genderswap, F/m, humiliation (I have a massive embarrassment squick, so characters being publicly embarrassed or humiliating themselves is a big no-no), M/f, fluff for the sake of fluff, domestic/curtain!fic, graphic non-con (but mentions of past non-con are fine, same for characters being threatened.

Stranger Things (TV 2016) 
Nancy Wheeler, Jonathan Byers, Steve Harrington

Hello! Please see my YT letter for more details about my likes/dislikes. Here below are some prompts! (Plus DNWs at the bottom.)

- I would love to see Steve's POV of the big fight onwards, up to the final Christmas scene, and then how the OT3 would get together post-canon.

- If the OT3 is not your cup of tea, I would love to see how they grow into a friendship. Maybe post-canon, they're back in school and Jonathan goes to thank them for the present, and they take it from there.

- What if Steve had gone to Nancy's house earlier in Ep 6? Except he's driving through the woods to her house when he hears Jonathan scream her name. They help her get out of the Upside Down together, and Steve gets roped into planning how to take the Demogorgon down. Bonus points for a scene where Nancy teaches Steve how to shoot.

- Role Reversal AU, Mike is taken by the Demogorgon instead of Will, and Nancy is determined to find him. Up to you how Steve and Jonathan get involved!

- AU, pre-canon: Steve is failing a class, Jonathan is assigned to tutor him/is the only one who can tutor him, and they sort-of turn into friends. Then the canon events unfold: how does Steve deal with helping his new awkward sort-of-friend find his brother without attracting Tommy H and Carol's ridicule, especially when they already give him grief over Nancy? Well, to start, a pool party will surely help Jonathan take his mind off his missing brother for one night. What's the worst that can happen, after all? (A Demogorgon, that's what).

- Post-canon, something about how Nancy's life has changed for her after fighting the Demogorgon. How does she adjust to going back to school? Bonus points if she gets confronted by Carol and Tommy H and wrecks them.
