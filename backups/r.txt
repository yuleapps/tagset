New Avengers (TV) 
Purdey (New Avengers), Mike Gambit (New Avengers), John Steed (New Avengers)

This is my perennial request, as you'll be able to tell from past Yuletide letters.  I'd love a nice smutty threesome with plenty of banter and good humor, but I'm happy with something that suits the tone of the series, or a day in the life, etc.  If you go for hurt/comfort, Mike's the one I'd enjoy seeing the other two try to coddle.

Good characters being evil
On-screen torture or non-consensual sex (recovery fics are okay, though, see heavy on the comfort above)
For Yuletide, I don't want AUs where the characters are in a different milieu like coffeeshop or highschool,etc. because I don't have enough of the original verse.

The Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett 
Martha Sowerby (The Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett), Mary Lennox (The Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett)

I'd love to see more of Martha's side of the story.  With all those younger brothers and sisters, does she have some insight into what Mary needs that didn't come out in the story.  And does Mary ever realize how much difference it made to have Martha be the person who saw to her needs when she first came to England?   Does Mary ever see  her as a person and not a servant?

Night Calls Series - Katharine Eliska Kimbriel 
Alfreda Sorensson (Night Calls), Marta Donaltsson (Night Calls)

I love these books, and I especially like the bits where Marta and Alfreda are exploring the magic they share.  This would be a good world for missing scenes within the timeline we have, letters between them over the years, or a reunion at some point in the far future.  It might also be interesting to get Marta's point of view on Allie -- the first time they \"met\" when Allie would have been small, perhaps?

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Tahani Al-Jamil

We know in season two that there was at least one mis-start that had Tahani and Eleanor as soulmates, and I would love to see how that played out.  Or go beyond the enemies-to-friends route (\"Mean Giraffe!\")  and take it to a femslash place.

The \"second chances\" trope is one of my absolute favorites, and that is already built into the series premise, so anything you do that keeps the tone of the show will be golden!

p.s. - feel free to add any of the canon characters you want.  I asked for Eleanor and Tahani as I want their relationship front and center, but Jason, Janet, Chidi, and Michael are welcome to play a part.

Alpha and Omega - Patricia Briggs 
Asil (Alpha & Omega), Bran Cornick (Alpha and Omega)

I really love Asil, and think his friendship with Bran is exciting.  I would love to see something about one of their earlier encounters, maybe a bit about why he trusts Bran so much and why Bran trusts him.  I think it would also be fun to put them in modern day hijinx, as Asil is being pulled out of his focus on the past to embrace the modern world.  I think Bran would be both pleased and startled by things that Asil adapts, maybe something as simple as going to a rose show to see some modern varieties.

Frontier Wolf - Rosemary Sutcliff 
Alexios Flavius Aquila, Cunorix (Frontier Wolf)

I was really taken by the way Alexios and Cunorix clicked immediately and how much they value their friendship, so anything that focuses on the strength of their relationship would be great! Hunting trips with just the two of them, maybe confiding in each other as they're both growing into their leadership roles; developing feelings through the summer and tentatively groping their way toward acting on that; or even after the Frontier Wolves withdraw and the Votadini are on their trail, how their connection shapes the way that events play out until it's just the two of them again, on opposite sides this time. I also have a letter up, if you'd like more detailed prompts. Thank you!

Monstrous Regiment - Terry Pratchett 
Maladict (Monstrous Regiment), Polly \"Ozzer\" Perks (Monstrous Regiment)

I really loved how in a regiment full of people keeping secrets Maladict picked Polly as a person to trust, so basically anything about the development of their relationship would be amazing. Slow burn through the course of the war, maybe some very confused feelings on Polly's part as the gender revelations come about,  getting together post-canon? First time shenanigans would be great, especially if, despite Maladict pretending to be very cool and suave, things don't go so smoothly in the actual moment. I'd also be thrilled with something about Polly becoming the excellent and competent sergeant she was meant to be and Maladict being very into it. On the flipside, I'm okay with whatever pronouns you'd like to use for Maladict, but I'd rather not have the narrative be about gender identity. I also have a letter up, if you'd like more detailed prompts. Thank you!

Wow, well, the chemistry is electric and consequently I ship everyone with everyone. (Just two Boston bro best friends who think that Jon L. is the funniest person on Earth!) Something about how their friendship developed would be great, or any kind of White House shenanigans. I'd also love to see any exploration of how they all eventually left this very high-pressure environment and then ended up drifting together again and founded this company together. And then of course, stuff about how they're doing now (ads that <i>didn't</i> make it into the pods!) and how they're going forward would be equally fantastic. Honestly, you can go in pretty much any direction you'd like! The only thing I'd ask is that real-life partners not play a significant role in the fic; pod-typical level of mentions would be fine, as would AUs where the relationship didn't happen. I also have a letter up, if you'd like more detailed prompts. Thank you!

I'd love to see how the two of them grew up together and ended up where they are at the beginning of the movie; or at the other end of the spectrum, meeting again post-canon after they've gotten their lives more together and seeing if they can work better this time. I'd also be thrilled to see an AU where they ended up going through with the Halloween party threesome, or a story where Charlie does leave for San Francisco (maybe without saying goodbye!). I also have a letter up, if you'd like more detailed prompts. Thank you!

君の名は。| Kimi no Na wa. | Your Name. 
Miyamizu Mitsuha, Okudera Miki

I have requested these two characters because I would really like to read more about them interacting together. Mitsuha seems to start out interacting with Miki for Taki's sake, only, but she clearly develops her own feelings for Miki pretty quickly. When Mitsuha doesn't get to go on the date with Miki she seems genuinely disappointed - she wanted to date Miki &amp; I was so sad for her when she woke up in her own body!

닥치고 꽃미남 밴드 | Shut Up Flower Boy Band 
Kwon Ji Hyuk, Joo Byung Hee

SU!FBB is one of my all time favourite dramas and I would love fic for it. I know that we only got to watch the interaction between these two characters in the first couple of episodes but it was more than enough to leave me with tons of feelings for them, individually and as best friends. Byung Hee is a bit of a loose canon, and he seems to get the group into a lot of potential trouble, but they still see him as the glue that binds the group together nonetheless, which intrigues me.

Triple H (Korea Band) 
Lee Hwitaek | Hui (Triple H), Kim Hyuna (Triple H), Kim Hyojong | E'Dawn (Triple H)

I loved this sub-unit's debut this year! Hyuna seemed to have tons of fun promoting with the boys; constantly updating SNS with them and talking about their chemistry. The 365 Fresh music video plays out like a four and a half minute movie, complete with sex, drugs, murder and some clear driving under the influence, which ends with the trio jumping (to their death?) from a parking lot wall as the police chase them, which is totally over the top and dramatic and scandalous. So, I loved it.

 I'd love to read something set in 365 Fresh video!verse, but if you'd prefer to write RPF about them I'm totally here for that too!

I love this show so much, and I would love anything with these two. For specific prompts: Tom and Barbara's first few months as a married couple, Tom and Barbara dealing with a crisis in poplar, a day out in the country where all sorts of things go wrong and they carry on and have a lovely day anyway, really anything light and fun (though I love how the show mixes light and fun with more serious issues, and that is welcome as well). I also love their interactions with the sisters and other nurses so please include anyone you need to make the story work.

Things I do not really like in fic: violence, animal harm, in story character death (things that deal with canon character death is okay), lots of darkness (a little is okay), non-con, and character bashing.

I am so very very sad this show ended and I miss checking in with the residents of Bluebell, Alabama. I would love some post series finale fic with Zoe and Wade still living in the guest house and Lavon and Lemon married and living in the main house. Especially dealing with raising kids.

Or really anything about any combination of these four. I loved how Zoe and Lemon's relationship developed over the series and I really think they ended in a good place though I'm sure Lemon will never be able to avoid schemes and dragging Zoe into them or vice versa. and Lavon and Zoe - I loved that they just became fast friends!

I also would totally be cool with Lemon/Lavon or Wade/Zoe ship fic with a side of the other two. I loved it when Zoe and Wade were friends with benefits and how they carried that forward into a real relationship.

This show really values all of their skills and I love how they play off eachother.

The Tillerman Cycle - Cynthia Voigt 

I've reread these books this year and have been blown away all over again by how amazing they are in terms of depth of character, thematic development of love and friendship and growing up and holding on and letting go and community and how we give to each other… I would love <i>anything</i> for these books. Any character. What <i>you</i> want to write, what interests you, that's what I want to hear about! I really, really want a Tillerman story to have a good ending, by which I don't mean an unalloyed happy ending — what I guess I mean here is I need a fic where the characters grow and learn, and where they're able to keep their family together, and I'm assured they're going to be OK, even if bad things happen in the meantime.

And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side - James Tiptree Jr. 

This story, like all of Tiptree's stories, is about sex and despair and really about what it means to be human. \"We're built to dream outwards.\" So: I want a story dealing with what that means, that humans are built to dream outwards (or not -- is that actually true?), whether it deals specifically with the situation set up in this story or whether it does something completely different with that sentence. Also, as Tiptree's stories have: love, sex, joy, despair, death, humanity, or biology — it doesn't have to be all of those, but I do contend that it should have at least one quotation from at least one piece of literature, if only in the title :) But anyway, I would really be happy with just about anything! I would ADORE to have a new Tiptree-esque story, whether it follows her style or draws ideas and themes from this story to be its own object.

Der Ring des Nibelungen | The Ring of the Nibelung - Wagner 
Brünnhilde (The Ring of the Nibelung - Wagner), Sieglinde (The Ring of the Nibelung - Wagner)

I would *love* an AU where Sieglinde survives and gets to actually parent Siegfried properly, maybe with Brunnhilde?? Or, if not parenting him together, how does it work when Brunnhilde meets Sieglinde again, and alt!Siegfried? Can they, now that they can work together (and if Siegfried is raised to be wise and observant instead of an idiotic brat) somehow still take down the gods without all dying horribly? (And how does it work if Siegfried is nice enough not to break Wotan's staff?) If that's not something you're interested in, I love their interaction and the emotions they have together, that amazing scene where Brunnhilde and Sieglinde really connect through Sieglinde's future child… Maybe a very slight AU where they have a bit more time before Brunnhilde has to face Wotan? Can she impart any additional wisdom to help Sieglinde?  Really anything where they get to interact and be awesome would be great! For this one I'm totally okay with dark (source canon is the end of the world, after all), but a) I don't want Brunnhilde/Siegfried if she is acting in an explicitly parental role towards him, or b) if Siegfried <i>is</i> nicer, I'd like that to have some sort of positive effect, even if overall it ends badly for Our Heroes.

I do really love the way Kethas, Krenn, and Tagore think about things, so I'd love to see some of that Thought Admiral/Captain thinky strategy and/or Tagore  even if it's through another character's experiences or thoughts.

Adventures of Shirley Holmes (TV 1996) 
Shirley Holmes (Adventures of Shirley Holmes), Molly Hardy

- What if, with Bo gone, to Molly's horror she somehow becomes Shirley's de facto adventuring companion?
- Detecting at a re-enactment or cultural event, per canon. Molly resenting both the necessity of a costume <i>and</i> Shirley, for requiring her to wear one.
- Victorian AU! Shirley and Molly as rivals in that era? Epistolary fic, whether letters to each other or to their respective friends.
- Undercover as a couple and hating almost every minute of it. At Christmas, if possible, giving Molly one more thing to be resentful of. Can't imagine she's spent many holidays with her parents.

LOVE: Mutual respect, prickly antagonism, grudging admiration, only-<i>I'm</i>-allowed-to-threaten-you-like-that

Or, she is their actual mother and they keep her busy full-time extinguishing the neighbours' gossip? Or she doesn't know them but remembers her youth spent sauntering the streets in fashions that made her elders despair of governing her.
- The girl in the dorm looks quite young to me; is she a resident or was she visiting an older sister or a slightly older girlfriend? Did she sneak out to the inn? Is there a love interest at the table: one of the boys, or one of the girls?
- Group/summer tour of some sort. Maybe they fall into a Trixie Belden/Nancy Drew/Mary Stewart type accidental intrigue? Or a more ordinary sort of adventure, summer flirtations and the like. I am definitely open to a relationship, or potential relationship, between any of the three younger girls.
- Tweaking the time period ever so slightly and setting it all mid-war. Teens as spies, or just ordinary kids in wartime. Is the staid older woman raising the next generation of spies, or is she their utterly oblivious dorm mother?

Dòu Máah Dáan | Peking Opera Blues (1986) 
Cou Wan | Tsao Wan

This film is so much MORE than I ever dreamed. More hilarious, more shippy, more dramatic. I think what I want most from this fandom is something on a similar emotional scale - not necessarily something where the plot itself has a national or international scope, but something that has room for opera slapstick, corpse puppetry, and torture; material concerns, and high aspirations; saving each other’s lives, and having sleepovers. Thematically, I’m really interested in the way the film shows friendship and familial love sometimes dovetailing with ethics and ideological goals and sometimes conflicting with them, and in the various ways women can find, or seek, their own independence.

Tsao Wan is the only character I’ve put in my request. I was fully expecting to come out of the film with femslash ships, and instead I have a big OT5 and a huge crush on Brigitte Lin (okay, that part I could see coming), so I’d be happy with any combination of the main five, including the two men, who were not nominated, as long as Tsao Wan is there. Some combination possibilities: how do any of them meet up again after the events of the film, whether by chance - do Bai Niu and/or Sheung Hung happen to be making a tour stop somewhere Tsao Wan has a mission? does Tsao Wan and Ling’s work take them near Tung’s village farm? - or intentionally - how would a new opera about Tsao Wan and Ling’s exciting adventures be created by Bai Niu and/or Sheung Hung, in terms of research and role creation? Or maybe Tsao Wan needs Bai Niu’s skills for a mission. In fact, maybe she needs everyone’s skills for a mission. Recruitment road trip! Some solo possibilities: what was Tsao Wan’s time in Europe like? Was she involved in any political activity there? What does she do post-film as History continues? In anything set post-film, I’d like to know that all five characters are important to each other, even if they’re not actually in the fic and/or sexually involved.

If you want to get really plotty, I love heist and con stuff like Leverage, Ocean’s Eleven (remake), and The Italian Job (original), where there’s a Plan with steps and roles, and then it plays out. If straight-up casefic isn’t your style, it could be fun to throw some shippy tropes at this canon (fake marriage where Tsao Wan is pretending to be the husband? hurt/comfort or sickfic? hell, I’d read accidental baby acquisition), but tropey stuff is not necessary - I’m just trying to throw out some ideas to get things moving. Ideally there’d be at least a figleaf of plot in the background, even if it’s not casefic.

Fandom-specific DNW: Explicit references to torture are still a hard DNW (I covered my eyes during the scene in question when watching the film), but I recognize it’s part of canon and consequently might be part of the world of the fic. If someone is tortured or creatively executed in your story, it’s fine to mention it but I do not want to know how.

Far from the Madding Crowd - Thomas Hardy 
Bathsheba Everdene (Far from the Madding Crowd - Thomas Hardy)

I didn’t nominate this and it didn’t occur to me that it would be in the tagset, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it! One thing that always sticks in my mind about this novel is the way Hardy calls Bathsheba “the young farmer” just as he refers to the men as farmers - which, just saying, is more than most people writing about this story can do - and so, that being the case, what I’m most interested in is something about Bathsheba as farmer. One day in the life or four seasons in the life or five plantings/harvests in the life, or pseudo-academic fic about a case study of a woman farmer in the Victorian era, or a conflict between the farm and nature that Bathsheba has to decide how to solve.

Feel free to bring in the other nominated characters or other major characters if it suits what you’re trying to do, but what I’m really looking for is a focus on Bathsheba’s work, determination, and process of learning. I’d also love to read something like a merchant ship AU (as the first alternate setting that came to mind where it would be not exactly the done thing for her to captain her inherited ship and make commercial decisions herself - although I do have to point out that contrary to popular belief, there were a lot of women on shipboard in the age of sail, may this be useful - but also where nature and luck/fate are as influential as they are in the original setting), or something in which the land, superstition, and ritual were more overtly magical.

月刊少女野崎くん | Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 
Kashima Yuu (Gekkan), Nozaki Umetarou

Pick a trope. Have them fuck it up.

That’s one of the things that makes me love this canon - the simultaneous send-up of and indulgence in tropes, in a very good-natured way. (Another way I’ve described its genre: “nothing happens, but very dramatically.” Everything is shocking or devastating or the pinnacle of bliss.) Kashima and Nozaki are two of the characters whose propensity to do this is most likely to set a story in motion, due to Nozaki’s experimentation/observation for his manga and Kashima’s princely self-fashioning and going 120% on everything; I also love Kashima’s bifauxnen-ness, acting talent, and earnest failboating, and the way that Nozaki could have been written as a tall-dark-handsome-stoic cipher guy and instead is just as quirky as anyone else. That said, this is an OR request, not an AND, and I’d also be happy to read stories about pretty much anyone from the nominated tagset (except Mikoshiba or Mayu; I don’t know Mayu very well because I originally got into this through the anime, and Mikoshiba just isn’t my fave, although I have no objection to his appearing in the story).

There are all sorts of lists out there of common shoujo(/romcom/fanfic) tropes if you’re not sure where to start. And, because Nozaki is all about subverting gendered characterization and role-boxing, and also about people trying to make their lives conform to narrative, go ahead and apply those tropes to whichever characters you feel would be the most interesting or fun. Feel free to pick non-high-school-setting ones, too, if there’s magical/historical/high-society shoujo you want to see them tackle, or to take a play that Kashima (and whoever else) is involved in as a jumping-off point.

As you may have gathered, I love the way the canon plays with romance tropes, but I would prefer no overt Shipfic. If you’d like to include a ship, whether slash/femslash or het, I’d like for it to be handled without much seriousness, and for friendship with characters who aren’t part of the ship to be a significant part of the fic, as per canon. I do really like the show’s variety of friendships between characters of different temperaments, interests, and sexes.

If you’re really getting a “why don’t you just rewatch/reread the canon, reconditarmonia” vibe off this, which I’m kind of giving myself, you could try sex comedy future fic? Give them magical powers? What I’m most interested in, wherever you go with this, is the playing-with-tropes thing.

Fandom-specific DNW: I love Hori and Kashima’s relationship, but I’d strongly prefer that her feelings for him not be written as overtly romantic. High levels of ambiguity/intensity/tropey-ness are fine and great.

Monstrous Regiment - Terry Pratchett 

Give me all the loyalty kink for this fandom. Characters rescuing each other from peril, risking their reputation or position or ethics to defend each other, accomplishing the impossible or sacrificing things without even thinking twice because one trusts the other’s orders or judgment. Or A not going off the leash or into danger to defend B because B said not to, to protect A’s conscience or life or reputation. Can be romantic or platonic - I ship Polly/Mal and Tonker/Lofty, but I would also be delighted with Polly&amp;Jackrum, Wazzer&amp;Polly, or other non-romantic twosomes or moresomes in situations of loyalty and trust. Maybe Polly sends Mal on a dangerous mission, or Tonker is captured after she and Lofty burn down another place where women and girls are being abused, or Polly protects Jackrum’s secret/s from someone who could reveal them, or Wazzer ends up in the field again with the general’s retinue and Polly and Mal rescue her from danger (or vice versa!!). What strengths or sacrifices do they have at their disposal for each other?

Pratchett-esque voices would be great. He’s really, really good at sucker-punching the reader with sincerity in an overall satiric mode, and I think that style lends itself well to this sort of thing.

I’m not going to lie, Polly is my fave. I like that this could have been a generic coming-of-age or women-in-war story, where the protagonist learns that she’s brave or worthwhile and then the crisis is past, but instead Polly learns that she’s a cunning bastard and a hell of a sergeant, and being a one-off hero in a country that’s at peace and making slow social progress isn’t good enough for her. That said, just because I’m better able to articulate what I like about Polly doesn’t mean I’d be less excited for fic about anyone else! I think that’s something I’d want to explore for any of the characters who enlist in the course of the story - what are these women good at? What lets them fulfill their potential? What do they want when their hand isn’t being forced? Or for Jackrum, who’s already gone through that whole process by the time the story begins, any more backstory would be fabulous.

If you’re going the Polly/Mal route, I also love ludicrous levels of sexual tension in a military context (I think it’s the unavoidable proximity + the presence of others making it hard to act on it).

Fandom-specific DNW: vampire romance tropes (such as turning and/or immortality) as focus; non-female pronouns/headcanons.

Simoun (Anime) 

Simoun somehow ended up being a really weirdly meaningful show to me. I loved how all these women got to be flawed and fucked-up, noble and loyal. How, in the mold of all my favorite epic shoujo anime, it starts off beautiful and fine and then Shit Gets Very Real and that’s actually one of the themes of the show - we had a little debate a few weeks ago on FFA as to whether or not Simoun was a military canon, and the fact that circumstances have remade a team of priestesses in fancy quarters and magic flying machines who are there to pray to God, put off their choice of sex, use their talents, maintain or claw their way into a social position, into a military force involved in a war - that’s an idea that the characters themselves struggle with in the show. (Neviril’s scene in the hearing is one of my favorites.) How everyone gets character development, in the sense of learning and changing, and even what seem like annoying mandatory straight subplots actually end up serving that thematic or character development, to say nothing of the more focal relationships between the leads (not just Neviril and Aeru, but also Mamiina and Rodoreamon, Neviril and Paraietta…)

I’d really like to read a fic where an individual character’s development or two characters’ relationship is similarly tied in to plot developments; it doesn’t have to be a plotty fic as such, but I was very interested in the way the developments of the war and the pilots/priestesses’ actions in it precipitated changes in their relationships. So how might Neviril and Aeru’s relationship develop in the other world (what are they doing?), or Mamiina and Rodoreamon’s on the Messis when they’re not the narrative focus before Mamiina’s last mission and the braid thing? (Or if this is more your speed, dig into that and see how a character grows or the relationship between characters develops when that’s not being moved along by outside events in the same way, especially if they’re aware of that being an issue. When Neviril and Aeru are outside the normal flow of time, or Paraietta and Rodoreamon are civilians, for example.) I’m also interested in all the permutations of loyalty we see in the show - like loyalty to a position over loyalty to a side (as with the Plumbish priestesses’ siding with our Sibyllae), loyalty that develops before liking or friendship, the devoted loyalty to Neviril. I like the show’s military themes despite its magical-girl visuals. I think this is also a canon where it would make sense for sexual first times to be part of a fic - what does that mean for the characters you choose?

I should also say that due to all the magic and timespace warping in the show, I am more than okay with post-canon fic that gets characters back together who were separated by canon, if that’s what you want. You can resurrect Mamiina, or have Neviril and Aeru visit the main reality/timeline again. Or play with timespace even more - time loop fic?

If you would have told me this time last year by favorite thing going in NXT would be Sanity (SAniTY? I always get which letters are supposed to be capitalized wrong) I would have wondered what wrestling mirrorverse you’d escaped from. But here we are! I love these weirdos and their weirdo camaraderie and I really just want more with them. I don’t necessarily ship any of these three so feel free to let your gen flag fly, but I also don’t not ship them? Go with your story flow, is what I’m saying here. If I HAD to pick a favorite it would probably be Alexander? Maybe? He hits that same underappreciated, team player sweet spot that makes Erick Rowan my favorite Wyatt, and I really like his dynamic with Nikki especially. If you were thinking about “a Sanity member gets beat up and the others are homicidally concerned over it” type of story, Alex would be my preferred target. (And it’s pretty much his role anyway!

I’m very OTP about them, please let them be happy for Yuletide (but absolutely pile it on before then!)

新日本プロレス | New Japan Pro-Wrestling 
Kenny Omega (NJPW)

Kenny is a beautiful mess of his own making and I haven’t fallen this hard this fast for a wrestler in a very long time. I love the legend-building he does, how he very deliberitly creates an image to project to the world and then warps everything to make it fit, including his own past. (Yes Kenny, Ibushi left you. He’s the bad guy here. That’s exactly how that all went.) I find his thought process fascinating and would love anything that explores how much of what he says he actually believes and how much of that bright-eyed kid who moved his whole life to Japan because he had to fight Kota Ibushi still exists. I love his ambition and the pride he takes in his work and would like anything that weighs that and his history making success against everything he had to sacrifice to get here.

It gotta have a happy (or at least bittersweet) ending though.
Like, the cure only half works and Yasu only looks normal while on the inside he's gone mad or the other way around. Or maybe Kashuu also gets corrupted and they run off together.

This is my go-to series when I need to restore my faith in humanity. I am looking for a story which makes me feel the way the books do: a little sad, but ultimate hopeful and uplifted. Blackout/All Clear are my favorite books of the series. If you could find a way to cross them over with the MCU, Bletchley Girls or Indiana Jones, you would officially be my favorite author.

Melos - Wednesday Campanella (Music Video) 
Japanese woman (Character played by KOM_I), Mongolian woman (Character played by ANU)

Holy crap, I was so struck by this music video when it came out, and I feel like there's so much story there to pick apart. I'm so intrigued by the story that it tells, with this slow development of friendship (and maybe something more) between two people of different cultures. The two women in the MV have such amazing chemistry--they just seem so fascinated by each other, and it seems like they develop such an intense, loving relationship.  I love the Mongolian woman who is the main character of the MV--she has this kind of longing and determination that is so compelling, and I'm so curious about her story. What makes her bond with a stranger who shows up in a broken-down truck? Is KOM_I's character a journalist who came to do a story in Mongolia and who got stranded? Or, if you want to play with some of the bits of strangeness in the video and its kind of modern-myth feel, is she some kind of minor supernatural creature who has taken a human form? Seriously, pick any bit of the MV to expand on, and I will be over the moon. Tell me about the Mongolian woman teaching KOM_I's character to ride, about the two of them playfully getting to know each other, and how that blossoms into this intense, loyal relationship. 

I love this MV both as a romantic story or a friendship story, but for serious, if you want to tell me about the two of them kissing, PLEASE DO. (The bit with KOM_I riding in front of the Mongolian woman on her horse! THE WAY THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER. That joyful hug at the end when they reunite! The lipstick!! I have mentally inserted kisses at so many points of this music video.)

(By the way, I'll be totally happy with however you want to deal with the names (or lack thereof) of the two characters--go for whatever option makes sense for the story you want to write!)

Oh my gosh, I love these two train kids so much, and I would absolutely love to see what they get up to post-canon. Both gen and femslash are great--I love their friendship, and oh my gosh, I would be thrilled to see them as girlfriends. Like, give me their sweet highschool romance (with occasional breaks for monster-punchings). Tell me about Mio crushing on Kagura and denying that she's wooing Kagura with home-made bento box lunches, or about the all the times that Mio almost confessed to Kagura, but got interrupted by a rampaging typewriter clown monster. Tell me about Kagura roping Right into planning an overly imaginative way to confess to Mio. I would love anything that explores how their relationship to the Rainbow Line as they get older, too--how they remember the time they spent on the Rainbow Line and how it affected them, and to what extent they're still in contact with the Rainbow Line as they grow older. Like, do they keep in contact with Akira? Oh my god. If you want to write about the different way in which Right, Hikari, Tokatti, and Akira  conspire to play matchmaker between Mio and Kagura, please do it, because it can only be amazing and disastrous. 

I loooove the weirdness and the cheesiness of tokusatsu, and the way that ToQger is such a funny, dorky series, while still being so emotionally affecting--I love the way that ToQger has this kind of essential good-heartedness and positivity at its heart, and I would love something that draws on that same kind of sweetness.

I LOVE THIS BAND SO MUCH. Seriously, they just get along so well and are such ridiculous nerds together, but they're also a group that really stuck together through some tough times, and all I want is just fun, tropey fic that shows off their dynamic. I love, love, love fic that is set in the canon idol setting, but has some magical-realism element/trope added to it, like superpowers, or sudden inconvenient mind-reading, or daemons, or whatever else you can think of. I really enjoy seeing how these tropes interact with the pressures and challenges of idol life. But also, give me all the goofy AUs. Space AU where EXID is a rag-tag bunch of space smugglers? Yes. Heist team AU? YES. 

Both gen and femslash are great! If you want to write something shippy, I love Hani/LE so much, as well as Junghwa/LE. I would love anything about Junghwa and LE trolling each other into dating through mutual bothering. Or LE and Hani fake-dating for convenience and being half-kidding and ridiculous about it but then developing Feelings.

Oh man, I really fell in love with the entire world of Pyre, and with Jodariel's gruff, protective manner. I would love anything that explores her relationship with the rest of the team, especially in the down time between rites. I'm fascinated by the world of the Downside, and I would love any worldbuilding related to it, especially everyday things like how foraging for food or making sure the camp is safe. I love the found-family dynamic of the wanderers, especially because it's so precarious and temporary, changing as people come and leave. It's so bittersweet, and I would love to get Jodariel's take on these delicate bonds between them. I'd love anything about Jodariel's early years in the Downside and how it felt for her to become a demon, or about her meeting Hedwyn and Rukey and the Reader.

I also love it when fic for games integrates gameplay mechanics into the story and explains them in terms of the universe? I would love anything that explores the way that doing the rites feels for the participants, how it affects their bodies, how they perceive the connection to other participants and to the Reader. I would love some straight-up h/c where Jodariel is hurt in some capacity, and she has to rely on the rest of the team.

Please tell me a story about Conway and Moran and their epic friendship and/or partnership! Something set in the canon universe would be awesome. Down time or squad time are welcome. I love Conway's fierceness and intelligence and I love Moran's canniness and intelligence. I love that it's the two of them against the world sometimes. I don't particularly ship them with each other fwiw. (If you desperately ship them, that's fine; I can deal.)

Stuff I like: gen, femslash, het, slash, poly relationships, asexual characters, women being awesome, genderqueer characters, found families, slices of life, competence, passion, magic, food, road trips, wonder, plants, pining, landscapes, world-building, canon-divergent alternate universes

Stuff I'm okay with: holiday stories, canon character death, unhappy endings

Do not want: onscreen graphic violence, focus on fire/fire-related trauma, unacknowledged abuse, onscreen underage sex, onscreen rape/non-con

Optional Prompts: Undercover dating for a job that doesn't lead to feelings; hanging out on a stakeout; Conway and Moran are confronted with more in-universe magic (not metaphors) (okay let them get confronted with metaphors too if you want but I'd prefer the magic to be real)

I love that Flower is a gentle soul trying his best throughout some big changes and that he's surrounded by other people doing the same. I love that he loves what he does and is good at what he does. Gen or ship fic would be equally welcome. (I don't ship Flower with anyone in particular fwiw.)

Vorkosigan Saga - Lois McMaster Bujold 
Ekaterin Vorsoisson Vorkosigan

Please tell me a story about Ekaterin! I love that she is creative and resourceful and coming into her own after some hard times. Something set in the canon universe would be awesome.

Please tell me a story about Jae-hee! Something set in the canon universe would be awesome.

I ship her with Kang Maru as long as it's a relationship where they are more-or-less equally nice or equally awful, fwiw. (I also ship all permutations of Jae-hee, Seo Eun-gi and Kang Maru.)

레전드히어로 삼국전 | Legend Hero Samgukjeon (TV) 

In all honesty I will accept fic about <i>any</i> characters from this show, whether they're in the tagset or not. If you want to write about the bug husbands or the Hero Pieces (especially postseries Liu Bei with his now-human pieces) or Sun Ce's preseries globetrotting I will be pleased as punch, don't worry

As far as prompts that stick to the tagset:

Shangxiang's rival-lust for Gongsun Zan was incredible enough when it was confined to martial arts competition. Now that Zan is learning the business side of running Dowon-Kwon, they'll be business rivals too. How does this lead to a confession/angry makeouts/an illicit night of passion and where do they go from there?

Diaochan finds out about Zhuge Liang's new role as wish-granter and wishes for her father back. I want to say I would prefer a happy ending but we all know good angst is good angst

Or maybe Diaochan doesn't, but there's a story in Cao Cao being uncomfortable taking Wang Yun's place (maybe he accepts help from the bug husbands, who are so thrilled to have a fan?)

Or \"No Legend War\" AU where Liu Bei still gets wrapped up in the Dong Zhuo investigation somehow but it ends successfully and Tae-O is left to deal with feeling like Wang Yun has replaced him with Liu Bei (which of course he hasn't, it was an <i>addition</i>, but Wang Yun underestimated Tae-O's capacity to Tae-O). Congrats Diaochan on your three dads once they sort it out.

And of course as much as Wang Yun/Tae-O/Liu Bei is <i>a</i> ship, Liu Bei/Zhuge Liang is <i>the</i> ship, and any excuse you could find to write about them spending time with Xu Shu would be grand.

I'm not kidding when I say I will love <i>any</i> fic about this show

Where to find this canon: there is an official playlist uploaded to YouTube by the creators <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUKUjYIsnUA&amp;list=PL8lZeURETyi1ITXZX1_x35-TTNnMRCZwn\">here</a> (be sure to turn on closed captions for English subtitles)

I love love love Daichi and X having the most gigantic crushes on each other and dating and having the most gigantic crushes on each other <i>while</i> dating but also I'm really interested in Kamiki and Tachibana?

What's going through their heads as they lead? How much do they let their team get away with and when and how do they draw the lines? Do they have disagreements and how do they handle them? Does their friendship extend outside the base? (It seems so, given their conversations when Kamiki's daughter gets married, or is theirs just a very close working relationship?)

Focusing specifically on Tachibana and even more specifically her time as Nexus would also be neat

うどんの国の金色毛鞠 | Udon no Kuni no Kin'iro Kemari | Poco's Udon World 
Tawara Souta, Nakajima Shinobu

I very much ship Souta/Nakajima. I'd be interested in a fic looking at the growth of their friendship and eventually romance over time (did they get together briefly in high school and post-canon/in canon timeline get back together?, did they just have feelings in the past and are just getting together now post-canon?, were they always just friends and meeting again as adults things are now different?). 

Fic exploring their relationships with their families is something I'd be interested in too, though please avoid familial rejection and anything more than light angst. Rinko seems to accept them as a unit (and family unit) when she sees them together, Nakajima's parents are trying to get him married off but Nakajima's dad did get to bond with both Souta &amp; Poco, if you want to write a story about families coming together and accepting each other I'd be here for that. 

For any plot line you feel like writing, feel free to include Poco if you'd like, I definitely love them as a family unit. If you want to write fic focusing post-canon I know Poco's inclusion is totally up for interpretation Poco and I'm fine with either way (though if Poco is absent as a human-shaped character, dealing with that absence for Souta and Nakajima emotionally in the fic would be neat).

Tales of the High Court - Megan Derr 
Sarrica (Tales of the High Court), Allen (Tales of the High Court)

I'd love to read more about Allen and Sarrica's romance post-High King's Golden Tongue. I have not read the following books in the series yet sadly as I'm waiting for the audiobooks (once I start in a series in audio I have to finish it that way, if possible). I'd be delighted with just something fluffy (or porny) for these two, but if you want to add in some political intrigue or linguistic nerdery I'd be totally delighted with that. 

I super enjoy Sarrica's snark with Lesto so if you want to add in his character as greek chorus/wingman I'd be totally happy with him as part of whatever you write (all the cast is great, I loved everyone). 

What I don't really want for these two though is miscommunication and angst. The slow burn of Golden Tongue gave me all the angst I need for these two and post-first-book I want them to be happy and without interpersonal conflict.

昭和元禄落語心中 | Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (Anime) 
Yuurakutei Sukeroku, Kikuhiko | Yuurakutei Yakumo

I ship Kikuhiko/Sukeroku a lot. If you want to write Kikuhiko pining or you want to write porn I'm here for either. If you want to write an angst, grief, and eating disorders/attempted-suicide-by-apathy story/character study for Kikuhiko (or generally Kikuhiko's romance with death), I would definitely read that.

I'd also be interested in Konatsu and Kikuhiko repairing/building their parent-child relationship, coming to understand each other a little better, and Konatsu as an Outsider POV reflecting on Kikuhiko's feelings about/relationship with Sukeroku. Or if you want to write a Sukeroku-didn't-die AU, I'd be happy to read how life would be if they raised Konatsu together, whether that is an uplifting story and a Happily Ever After, or not so much. 

The only thing I do not want is Shinnosuke as Kikuhiko and Konatsu's kid, I know that's a possible interpretation of canon but I very, very much can't deal with that at all, so if at all possible if that could not appear in any way in the fic I would be grateful.

Renowned Explorers: International Society (Video Game) 
Maria Rodriguez (Renowned Explorers), Emilia Karwowska (Renowned Explorers)

I've always considered RE:IS to be a game that is very suggestive or story and of characters. In reality, there isn't actually all that much there, since most encounters are limited to a paragraph or two at most, but it always feels to me as if there's more to it. The different attack animations make the characters feel alive, for instance, as do the characters' specific skills and abilities.

I picked Maria and Emilia as my characters here because I think it would be fun to see how they would interact. Maria, of course, is confident, seductive and flirtatious, whereas Emilia always comes across as more of a shy and naive ingenue type of character. The age difference (respectively 24 and 18) also seems to reinforce that dynamic. It's up to you whether you want to approach this as a romantic relationship between the two, as more of a mentor relationship, just as friends or colleagues, as a contrast in how they interact with people they meet on their travels, as an unrequited crush (either way!) or in any other way that you think of.

If you're looking to include other characters, then I'm also very fond of Anna and Dolores, but please don't feel any pressure to include them. Truthfully, I think I like all of the characters, so would probably be delighted with whoever you included. Or delighted if you just stuck with Maria and Emilia. The one exception is that I haven't played very much with The Emperor's Challenge DLC, so I don't know those characters and would prefer that you not include them on anything more than an incidental level.

In terms of the overall plot of the story, I am open to all sorts of possibilities. If you want to take something from the game and expand upon it, then that would be cool. (I would prefer they use a friendly approach, if possible.) This could be a single encounter, a full expedition, or even a complete campaign. Or it could be a campfire story. Or then again, you might want to completely make up a new expedition that isn't in the game; there are lots of amazing places on earth that aren't in the game (the Himalayas! The Silk Road! The Amazon! Madagascar! Siberia! Lots of others!). Or you might prefer to look at how they originally met and decided to go exploring together, or at what they do after their adventures are over, after they've found fame and fortune.

OVERALL LIKES &amp; DISLIKES, AND GENERAL NOTES
(These are copied and pasted and are identical in all my requests.)

Firstly, I just want to say hello, dear author, and thank you for offering to write me something set in one of these wonderful fandoms. I hope you're as excited to write for it as I will be to read for it. I also want to stress that I absolutely don't expect you to cover all of the different points that I'm making here, either in this section or the individual prompts. They're there to try to inspire you and give you ideas, and to give you a general idea of my tastes and preferences, not to be a checklist that I want you to tick things off from. I'm sure I will love whatever you end up writing for me.

That said, onto the extra details. Generally speaking, I like gen, and I like F/F relationships &amp; romance. I am not particularly interested in sex (of any orientation), or in M/F or M/M relationships. It's not that I'm inherently opposed to these things, if they happen as a background or incidental story element; I'd just prefer that they aren't the main focus of things.

Tropes &amp; story elements that I enjoy:
Chosen family
Non-traditional relationships
Trust
Working together
Friends to lovers
Happy endings
Fluff
Genderbending &amp; genderfluidity
Bets, dares &amp; forfeits (low stakes, silly, for fun)
Science &amp; technology

&nbsp;

Dislikes, squicks &amp; DNWs:

Racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. (even if it's from villainous characters; I just want a break from having to think about that stuff)
Gum (squicks me)
Rape/non-con/dub-con
Major character death

XCOM Series (2012 reboot) 
Lily Shen (XCOM 2)

I found Shen a fascinating and sympathetic character because of how the war and XCOM had basically been her whole life. She was 8 during the initial invasion, and had been focused on her father's legacy ever since then. She had none of the trappings of what we would consider a normal life from that point forwards. One of the more touching moments in the game, for me, was when she had to put her pet GREMLIN in danger, for the sake of the mission. That a robot is possibly her closest friend was so very telling.

I'd love to see the more human side of Lily Shen. Maybe as a stolen moment during the war. Maybe as something that happens after the aliens are defeated, where she finally gets to explore who she is as a person, rather than who she is as an engineering prodigy. Maybe even something that happens after the invasion but before the events of XCOM 2?

I wonder, who are her friends among the crew of the Avenger? Does she have any? Is she romantically involved with anyone? (Firebrand? Outrider?) What does she do when there are missions going on? Does she get nervous, hoping everyone makes it back alive? Is she trained to fight at all? What special programming has she given to ROV-R? How do they interact? When and where did she get her tattoo? What does she want to do when the aliens are defeated? Is it even something she's ever thought about, or has she been too focused on her work? Would she ever want to femme it up -- given the chance -- or is she truly happiest in the sort of practical, utilitarian clothing we tend to see her in?

Swallows and Amazons - Arthur Ransome 
Titty Walker, Dorothea Callum, Peggy Blackett

I have to confess, I'm finding this prompt harder to write than my others. It's surprisingly difficult to put into words exactly what it is that I like about this series. I think the best I can do is to say that I find it calming. Grounding. It's an escape from whatever ails me, into a world where problems are simpler to state and never insurmountable, and where the possibilities are endless.

I think that the feeling of endless possibility is also a big part of what draws me to the series as a fandom and makes me want to read more fic set in that world. It's also why I've chosen the characters that I have. Titty and Dorothea are the creative ones, the dreamers. Then there's Peggy, who seems always to be in Nancy's shadow, struggling to find her own identity outside of trying to live up to her big sister's expectations.

I guess I'm looking for \"what comes next?\" here. What happens as the characters start to get older? As childhood gives way to adolescence, and the nature of adventure starts to shift? If the Walkers and the Callums still take their holidays at the lake, what form do they take as the children are in their teens? Do they stop seeking adventure and instead prefer a more languid life, messing about in boats still, but with less urgency? Just enjoying the company of old friends? Or do they seek out ever grander adventures, more befitting of their abilities (as was starting to happen by the latter books of the series)? Do any of the friendships turn to romance? And whatever the answer, is it the same for all of them, or do they tend to separate into sub-groups as they grow older? If yes, how do they retain their bonds as a single group of friends?

If possibly I would prefer to keep the setting in the Lake District, at least partially, since that is a place that is dear to me. I also prefer to keep the focus on the Swallows, Amazons, and Ds, rather than the Coots or Eels, since I am more familiar with the former set. Finally, I would prefer to keep the setting before the outbreak of WW2, since that changes everything.

- Lady Whose Overniceness In Her House Makes Her Husband’s Life Uncomfortable - What does the poor woman suffer? How might she reply to a missive of the sort Richardson suggests? What might a letter coming from another angle say to her about how to handle her husband?
- Miss Dawley - The poor woman wants to talk about politics and current affairs - I imagine her lonely and wanting a friend, instead beset with suitors. What is going on in her world? What would she say if she could speak plainly?
- A Young Lady Affecting Manly Airs - Her uncle says going to Bury has improved her, is that related to her “appearing more masculine”? Does the improvement in her person and the manly airs have a common root - perhaps the love of a good woman?

Anne of Green Gables - L. M. Montgomery 
Gilbert Blythe (Anne of Green Gables - Montgomery), Anne Shirley (Anne of Green Gables - Montgomery), Diana Barry (Anne of Green Gables - Montgomery)

My number one trope is best friends falling in love, and Anne is the perfect example. I ship her with both Diana and Gilbert (not at the same time) (although, hmm), so I’d be happy seeing her with either kindred spirit.

I’d love to see some early married life for Anne and Gil. Getting used to each other, finding new quirks, making routines, playing house, balancing their ambitions. Does he call her Carrots in bed?

For Anne and Diana, give me youthful crushes and kisses pre-marriages, or give them a happily ever after living in their own lovely home with a spare room. It’s all good.

Also, snow. Winter. Kissing. Sleigh rides and snuggling. Enjoying sharing a bed for the warmth. Fighting in the snow/being snowed in together when they are just friends or after. Yay. (Also, I really love PEI and nature and would love any Island wandering descriptions.) (Anne and her partner probably wouldn’t get carried away outside, would they? But hey, maybe! Moonlight madness.

American Girls: Kit - Various Authors 
Kit Kittredge, Ruthie Smithens

Periodically, I get on a huge 1940s kick, and here I am again. I would love something set during WW2 on the homefront, which is one of my favorite time periods and settings. 

I ship Kit and Ruthie, but understand if you don’t. I love Kit’s sense of adventure and Ruthie’s romanticism, and how they play off each other. They’re great friends/potentially more, and I’d love to see what they get up to during the war.  What are they doing for the war effort? Is the USO involved? Dances? Is Kit a journalist, or playing ball, or a riveter? Does Kit think there’s a spy on the loose, and drags Ruthie into an investigative adventure? I’d love all the details, however you choose, and I would especially love to see romance/fun in the snow. I’m a big fan of winter and snow and snow activities.

Remember WENN 

I would love to see life in the 40s here. I have always been fascinated by the Barbican Hotel for Women and it would be great to see Betty’s experience living there. For Maple, I tend to ship her and CJ, which I know is odd, but anything exploring her past and/or sex positive love life would be super fun. Something about hers and Scott’s past, how they met and stayed friends/with benefits would be wonderful, too. 

I’ve always said I wanted to grow up to be Hilary Booth. I especially love her complexity - she’s a woman who knows her value, but is insecure, torments her husband but will take care of him and his nightmares nightly without letting him know. What are things like from her perspective, with all the emotions she hides?

I am a huge fan of winter and snow, so I would, most of all, like it to feature snow in some way. Whether it’s being snowed in (there’s another prompt! That Christmas the WENNers were snowed in at the station would rock, maybe cuddling for warmth, or a snowed in slumber party at the Barbican!) or flakes just starting to fall, I love it.

Oregon Trail (Video Game) 

I am a historical fiction nerd, and this game may be one of the formative reasons why! My favorite thing was always to use the diary feature to create my own romance/soap opera amongst my characters. (Always carefully named and aged for optimal romances, ha.)  I think this is why I basically spend October-December reading 19th century pioneer based Christmas romance novels. 

So, give me a fun adventure with your party, preferably with a romance. (With characters older than 18, please.) I would love the main character to be female and while I have a slight preference for femslash, I would also enjoy het.

Do these characters meet in Missouri when their families join the same wagon train west? One wanted to move west and one is horrified by the turn of events that led to the train?  Does one have to save the other in some way, especially being miles away from towns? I do enjoy sick/injury fic, and hurt/comfort (with an emphasis on the comfort). And most importantly, all of the game tropes, highlights and milestones!

Supernatural Society - Gail Carriger 
Imogene Hale (Supernatural Society), Genevieve Lefoux (Supernatural Society)

I read Romancing the Inventor this past May, fell hard in love with Madame Lefoux, and spent the rest of the summer reading all the other books in every related series.  It was a highly enjoyable time, but the novella is still my favorite--lesbian steampunk romance with a cross-dressing inventor! What’s not to love? (The novella stands alone very well, and is all that is needed for these prompts!) 

So: what was going on in Genevieve’s mind during the story? Why was she so obsessed with a 9 year age difference, when Imogene is nearly 30? What is life like when they get a chance to move back to London or anywhere away from the hive? What creative ways does Imogene use to make sure Genevieve takes breaks from the lab and eats/spends time with her?  

I loved seeing Genevieve and Imogene in bed, so this is one fandom where I’d enjoy some good gertruding scenes! I’m sure they can get very creative. Are there inventions involved? Do any go awry?

This is perhaps my most favorite novel, or at least my most favorite comfort-read novel; I love the way we get to follow Kit as she grows up, and the way all her relationships unfold and change over the years. There's a gentle loveliness to this book that I adore. 

I'd love to see a bit of the story of what happens to Kit and Stevie next. What is their future like, in this new Ireland? What happens after Lena's death? Do they stay in Lough Glass, or do they move to Dublin or London? Give me a slice of their life and I'll be so happy. Seriously: I think I ask for this every year at Yuletide.

This one has been on my list of wishes for years, so I would read just about anything. I confess, I don’t ship the canon pairing Cliff/Tamara. Instead, I ship Cliff/Lydia van Dyke, Tamara/Helga, Mario/everyone and Lydia/everyone. Both Lydia and Tamara are my favourite characters, so of course I would love to read fic about them being awesome or having fun together. But I’d also read teamfic, adventure, canon pairings and a story about Villa or the other members of the crew. I also think a story about Spring-Brauner has potential. Canon left me with a desire for more that I haven’t satisfied yet. If you are a native speaker of German, please consider writing the story in German, if that isn’t against the rules. If not, English will do as well!

I really crave more about the family life of Damien Locke, particularly his relationship with his father and the adults in his life.

Maybe a fic about him attending some family gathering or someone throws a party for him when he passes summer school after book 4.

After Civil War I fell down a youtube rabbit hole of cast interviews and PR that left me with an intense craving for Anthony Mackie/Sebastian Stan who have the most adorable chemistry between them - teasing, mutual appreciation, some actual competition I think, Team Cap solidarity. I love behind the scenes stuff, and in general find the setting of the Marvel films filming pretty fascinating - a project these people return to time after time, and especially Civil War when all of these different characters were brought together. So anything Mackie/Stan you want to write, or like, Mackie/Stan/Evans, will be cherished.

(*btw if you're worried - Stan/Evans aren't eligible in the nomination process, but you can definitely still write them either into the story or as part of a ship, so long as the fic isn't, like, only about them.)

If you are not into that ship or their relationship at all, I am very happy to read about Anthony Mackie on the set or press tour, interacting with RDJ, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, the rest of the actors, yay team.

Or, if you prefer something else - Doreen's the kind of person who's going to be underestimated so much of the time, whether for her powers or her social skills or personality, and I love moments where people who underestimated you are proven wrong, or discover your secret skills/identity(/the fact that you're kind of BFFs with Iron Man).

DearS 
Nonaka Hirofumi, Xaki (DearS)

I'd especially love to see how they're doing after the end of the series, but something set during the manga would also be just lovely--anything that expands on what little we see of them together. Slash/pairing fic would be amazing, but gen is fine too; please don't ship either character with anyone else, though. I'm really interested in Xaki's feelings on being a DearS with a master after so long as a Biter, and how the importance of service and pleasing one's master works for Xaki, since he's presumably not used to them or even properly trained to serve instead of fight. Why was Xaki drawn to Nonaka in the first place and how does he feel about Nonaka as he spends more time around him? And, of course, on the other side of the equation I'd love to see how Nonaka's life is changed by Xaki and hopefully him coming to feel that it's a good thing that Xaki chose him.

Magna Carta: Tears of Blood 
Calintz, Agreian Jei Owen

Something set late in the game would be really, really awesome--the later the better, even. A canon-what-if type AU could be especially interesting with this one, or even a complete AU as long as you maintain their complicated relationship and keep the setting fantasy or science fiction. Something set earlier in the game, maybe something lighter but with some foreshadowing, could also be interesting! Slash or gen are both cool; I do like Reith as a character, though, so even if the fic is slash please don't bash her. Themes or ideas I'm particularly interested in: basically, the themes that get presented in canon with Calintz having to re-evaluate his feelings and beliefs as he learns more about the people and events he's involved with (especially after late-game events).

More of how Ramirez changed from the person Fina knew to the one we meet in the game would be lovely, as would more of the late-game fallout; we get some backstory in the Legends version of the game, but there's always room for more! Further insight into Galcian's head could also be very interesting.

Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuchou Tou 
Hiyuu Tatsuma, Houraiji Kyouichi

I ship these two like FedEx, but I'd also be happy with friendship gen; please don't ship either character with anyone else, though. I love how quickly they became close, and how well they understand each other; Kyouichi's protectiveness of Tatsuma, watching over him when he needs it and when he doesn't, is really great. I'd love to see what happens after Kyouichi and Kisaragi track Tatsuma down in China. Are there physical consequences for Tatsuma (other than the hair and eyes), like for the Vessels of the Four Gods? Or an outtake from earlier in the anime could also be nice--Kyouichi and Tatsuma taking down a demon, or a gang, or just hanging out together. Honestly I just want more of them together. I'm open to appearances by other characters from the series, as long as Tatsuma and Kyouichi are the main focus.

Yumekui Kenbun: Nightmare Inspector 
Hiruko (Yumekui Kenbun)

A nightmare/case we didn't see during the series would be great! Or, while I did love the ending from a story perspective, I definitely would not object to a fix-it that gives Chitose another chance (as a Baku or a human) post-series. I'm less interested in straight up fluff or wacky Delerium hijinks being the main focus of the story, but a little bit of that to lighten things up would be nice. (I realise I'm basically taking a lot of words to say \"the canon, but more of it,\" here). I don't particularly ship Hiruko with anyone, and Mizuki/Hiruko is a definite NOTP for me, but if you want to go in a shippy direction I'd prefer it be in a post-series fix-it context--maybe with Azusa or Tsukishiro, and how they've been changed (or not) by everything that happened? Generally speaking I'm open to appearances by any of the other major characters, as long as Hiruko is the main focus.

Atomic Blonde (2017) 
Delphine Lasalle, Lorraine Broughton

I loved everything about this movie, from the glorious neon-noir aesthetic to the soundtrack to the amazing, captivating characters ♥ I fell in love with both Delphine and Lorraine, and I really enjoyed how they both have such different relationships to the work they do. As with nearly every movie I've ever loved, my only complaint is that we only get such a brief look at the characters and their lives. I would love any sort of missing scene from the film, or any sort of backstory for either character about how they got into their profession, or how they currently feel about it. Or, for more specific prompts: 

* Delphine survives somehow!  Instead of being killed, maybe she's taken and interrogated and that gives Lorraine a chance to rescue her.  Or maybe Lorraine interrupts the assassination attempt?  Or something where Delphine figures out a way to save herself. 
* I would also love a story where Delphine still dies, but her memory haunts Lorraine.  Or something with her ghost literally haunting her! 
* I would love casefic of them having to solve a mystery or hunt down an enemy spy together!  Or some sort of survival run, where one of them is injured and the other one has to make sure they escape the bad guys on their heels.  
* If they both survive, what happens to them after the movie?  Would they both still be involved in spy work?  Or would one or both of them give it up and try to live normally?  
* I'd love something where Lorraine tries to leave Delphine after the events of the film because ~she's too dangerous to be around~ and Delphine just isn't having any of it.

Death Stranding (Video Games) RPF 
Mads Mikkelsen (Death Stranding (Video Games) RPF), Hideo Kojima (Death Stranding (Video Games) RPF)

My obsession with them is probably in a lot of ways my own fault for being excessively hyped about Death Stranding, but I can't help myself! They're so cute together! I almost want Death Stranding to take a decade to come out so I can stretch out all the press/promotional together between the two of them. Going through Hideo's twitter really is a delight, I really love how genuinely excited he gets about the things he thinks are cool, including Mads. I really love reality distortion/surrealism/magical realism in my RPF, or any kind of AUs. For more specific prompts: 

* Eventually Death Stranding is going to come out, and they'll probably do some sort of press tours then, right?  I would love to read about that!  I would happily read just 10k of Mads trying to explain the plot of the game to a reporter. 
* Anything with twitter hijinks! Or press tours and promotional photos that imply there's more going on in the background?  
* AU where instead of a video game, it's actually Hideo filming his first movie!  
* Anything with the lines between the game itself and their filming it getting blurred! 
* Heist AU!  Something where Hideo isn't just making a video game, he's assembling a team because reasons.

The Exorcist (TV) 
Marcus Keane, Tomas Ortega

I'll be up to date with the show as it's airing, so feel free to include any spoilers that might pop up.  Or, if you don't like writing for ongoing canon, I'm also cool with you pretending the second season doesn't exist and doing your own thing!  This is one of my favorite shows of all time, it honestly seems like someone designed specifically to appeal to me!  I love how Tomas and Marcus struggle with both their faith and the hierarchy of the Church, as well as either other, but they're still both so driven to do the right thing. There's never any respect for personal space in any of their scenes and I really love that, and I love all the heightened emotional intensity that comes from fighting demons! I like that they argue, but their arguing almost always comes down to how much they care about each other and the people they're trying to help.   For more specific prompts: 

* One of them gets possessed by a demon, and the other has to perform an exorcism on him!  
* I would love backstory for either of them - what was Marcus's childhood like, and his training as an exorcist?  How does that influence how he tries to train Tomas?  Or I'd love more about Tomas trying to find his way in the Church hierarchy when he was first starting out.  
* I would love any kind of case fic about them performing exorcisms, or trying to figure out if a certain case is really supernatural in nature of it it's just normal human evil and deception.  
* I would love more about what exactly happened with Marcus after the ending of last season, or more of the two of them and Bennett trying to unravel and fight the conspiracy within the Vatican.  
* I would also love something with either or both of them following up with the Rance family and bonding over their shared experiences.

Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu | Legend of the Galactic Heroes 
Walter von Schenkopp, Yang Wenli

I don't have any strong feelings about how their names are spelled, so go with whatever version you're used to.  Anyway, this canon is massive, and there's still so much I want to know about the characters and their lives!  There's so much room for backstory and missing scenes, or so many places where you can go with interesting what-ifs. I tried narrowing my request down to my favorites, which was a brutal process, but I really love these two and how well their strengths work together.  I love the intensity of Schonkopf's dedication to Yang, and I loved the way Yang was willing to trust in him when so many others weren't.  I ship them pretty hard, but I'm also into Yang/Frederica, Yang/Dusty, and Schonkopf/Dusty if you want to write those instead!  For more specific prompts: 

* I'd love something set right after they first take Iserlohn, back when they're still getting a feel for each other.  
* AU where they don't die!  Either where they both survive until the end of the show, or only one of them does.  How do things go if Yang isn't killed on the way to meet Reinhard?  How does that change the course of Schonkopf's life too?  Or, what if Schonkopf dies before Yang does? 
* I really enjoy the way the narration of the show/story works like a historical text, and I'd love something based on that.  How do people in the future look back at the characters and their relationships? 
* I would love more backstory for either of them!  How does Schonkopf feel about his family and their defection from the Empire? How does he feel about the way the Rosen Ritter are viewed?  Or I'd love to see more about Yang's early days in the Academy, or more about how he related to his parents.  
* I'd love something slice-of-life, set either in the quieter periods of life on Iserlohn, or anything with them interacting while they were under observations on Heinessen.

Lottie Person, Misty Sutton | Cutegirl, Caroline | Coolgirl

I'm an issue or two behind right now because my LCS keeps getting short-ordered and I had to special order them online, but I will be all caught up by winter!  This series has me hooked so hard!  I can't get over what a great protagonist Lottie is.  She's terrible, and most of her problems are entirely self-inflicted, but she's still so sympathetic in spite of all that.  And I love the whole cast, with all their foibles, and the sense of something dark and uncertain going on underneath it all. How much of it is really happening, and how much of it is the already neurotic Lottie losing her grip on reality?  I really love her frienemyship with Misty, and I love how uncertain and disorienting everything about her relationship with Coolgirl is.  And I ship all possible combinations of these three!  For more specific prompts: 

* So what is up with Caroline? I'd love something with her relationship with Lottie where Lottie increasingly can't tell how much of it is real or not, or anything that expands on their dynamics.   
* Caroline and Misty! Them sniping with each other? Each of them trying to undermine Lottie's relationships with anyone else? Something where they're interacting and it turns into some weird conspiracy in Lottie's head? Threesomes???
* Any kind of straight comedy with Lottie and Misty running their blogs! Or them low-key/high-key undermining each other for status. 
* Murder mysteries!  Who dies, who's alive but Lottie thought they died, who did it, and how did it happen? Is everything we see in the comic happening in the order Lottie thinks it is, or is she confusing her own timeline? 
* Anything with any of the girls dressing up or getting ready for photoshoots with each other!

* AU of the best timeline where Gareth Edwards convinces someone to let him actually do the Catalyst movie, or Catalyst prestige cable mini-series, or anything involving the two of them having to work together a ton. Or just them working on something totally unrelated in the future!

Keltiad - Patricia Kennealy-Morrison 

ANYTHING ANYTHING ANYTHING I WILL TAKE IT ALLLLLL. If you are pinch hitting and willing to try an untested fandom, I will buy you copies of the first three Keltiad books. (100% serious offer. Contact me via a #yuletide chat or Discord hippo or ask a third party to send me a PM on Dreamwidth.) I am so desperate for fic in this world I cannot even tell you.

Okay, my dream is poly Aeron/Gwydion/Rhodri (PLEASE) (PRETTY PLEASE). And I nominated Haruko because the Aeron &amp; Haruko dynamic is so interesting and I'd love to see more of it and also yay writing about nonwhite characters. But seriously ANYTHING in this fandom would make me THE HAPPIEST.

I'd prefer fics that stick close to canon in both content and style, except that Keltia clearly needs more queer people and some of the Kelts clearly were queer and you should feel free to queer it the fuck up.

Siblings are very very very kind of sketchily intimately close on Keltia, and Aeron marries not one but two foster-relations, so although I would not usually be into siblingcest, if you can make me believe Gwydion/Arianeira hatesex then go for it. I'm also fine with Aeron/Morwen and what the hell, even Aeron/Arianeira. 

Canon-specific DNW: Any blood-relative incest other than what's in canon or mentioned above.

General likes: Please see my letter!

General DNW: Please don’t depict anyone being dizzy, feeling faint, spinning rapidly around, or having vertigo. Please don't depict unpleasant things happening to someone’s arms or hands. Unless I request otherwise for a specific fandom, please don’t depict or focus on character death or serious injury, mental or physical abuse, or detailed depictions of pain, grief, or sorrow, and please give your fic at least a happy-for-now ending. Please don't depict child death or have characters discuss it in any detail.

Please don’t include any slurs or stereotypes about race, religion, gender, culture, dis/abilty, etc. Please don't depict a minority character being harassed or harmed because of their minority status, even if it would be in character and in canon.

Please don’t depict people being drugged or intoxicated to the point of acting differently than usual.

For works with sex or kink content (barring specific exceptions noted in my requests), please do not include noncon or dubcon; significant power imbalances (like boss/employee, parent/child, or teacher/student); humiliation; abuse; incest; or sexual activity involving animals, children, or teens. Also, please do not include activities involving scat, piss, blood, needles, or permanent physical or mental harm. Beyond that, anything goes as long as it’s in character and people are having fun.

The Hound and the Falcon - Judith Tarr 

I feel like the only thing really missing from these books is protagonist queerness. Let's fix that! Alf says several times that he isn't queer, but I could absolutely see Jehan pining for him. I could also see Thea teaching Alf that he's not as straight as he thinks by taking a male shape. Or maybe Morwin was Alf's first love (with more pining) and he thought he could never love again after Morwin's death. 

I'm not usually one for angst but this seems like a canon that kind of demands it. That said, I'd like at least slightly optimistic endings, or something resembling being peacefully reconciled to things being the way they are. 

Canon-specific DNW: Alf/Jehan when Jehan is underage, or while they're still at St. Ruan's and have the teacher/student dynamic going. Alf/Morwin when they're underage. Noncon, including Thea using her shapeshift ability to seduce Alf (or anyone else) without him knowing it's her. Thea taking the shape of a specific other person (e.g., pretending to be Jehan so Alf can finally know what it would be like to have sex with him). Infidelity (consensual non-monogamy is fine).

Desk Set (1957) 
Bunny Watson (Desk Set (1957))

This is another fandom where I will gladly take anything that's in the spirit of the original. I've specifically requested Bunny because I would like her to be in any Desk Set fic I get, but I'm perfectly happy with any or all of the other nominated characters making appearances and being fairly central to the story.

Some ideas: Peg and Bunny being hilarious! Peg and Bunny in a pre-canon moment of mutual loneliness realizing that sex totally doesn't work for them and they'd rather be friends! Sumner and Bunny being witty and sharp at each other! Something nice happening to poor Miss Warriner, who's stuck being the butt of all the jokes! Bunny and Miss Warriner figuring out how to get along would be especially grand. 

I've long dreamed of a modern AU where Sumner is female and she and Bunny queer the hell out of everything. I'd also love a future AU where Emerac is a robot and Bunny/Sumner/Emmy is an actual threesome. Go to town.

Canon-specific DNW: If you don't do an AU, no contradiction of canon, please. For example, Peg and Bunny both canonically like men. There's nothing to say they <em>don't</em> like women, so feel free to write them queer, but not as lesbians or anti-male. Also, authentic portrayal of Sumner's autistic traits is totally fine (and by all means include some that don't appear in canon), but he's already verging on a stereotype of the literal-minded, nerdy savant, so please do your very best to avoid further autism clichés in your depiction of him. Smooching and cuddling are fine, but no smut, please.

Oz - L. Frank Baum 
Princess Ozma (Oz - Baum)

Long before I knew I was trans, I was enthralled by Tip's transformation into Ozma. I would love to read any of Ozma's thoughts about gender and transness in Oz. Perhaps she helps an OC visitor to Oz who very badly wants to be one of the princesses. Genderqueerness and gender binary transgression/upending would be really interesting to explore too.

I didn't get a chance to nominate Rinkitink and Bilbo this year, but if they just somehow happen to show up in your fic that would make me <em>extremely happy</em>. Maybe Bilbo has something to contribute to the discussion about being stuck in a body one dislikes. Maybe they're just an awesome hilarious queer couple. If it doesn't fit, don't worry about it, but this would be a lovely lovely perk if you think of a way to swing it.

I'm only familiar with the 14 original Oz books; you're welcome to put in references to the movies, <i>Wicked</i>, the Ruth Plumly Thompson books, etc. if that makes you happy, but please don't hinge the story on them.

Canon-specific DNW: Any sex or kink content at all. Any death or violence at all. Deliberate misgendering of trans characters by people who know their correct gender. Narration that misgenders a trans character (so if your OC knows she's a girl and wants to be called Susie, the narration should call her \"Susie\" and \"she\" regardless of her appearance, e.g., \"Susie crossed her arms and stuck out her chin. 'I'm not a <em>boy</em>,' she said\"). Racism (even canon-accurate racism). Sad endings, angst, woe.

Chronicles of Prydain - Lloyd Alexander 
Orddu (Chronicles of Prydain), Orgoch (Chronicles of Prydain), Orwen (Chronicles of Prydain)

There are 50 Prydain fics on AO3 and none of them feature the Witches of Morva! Let's fix that.

Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch are ripe for crossovers. Maybe Doctor Who has a question only they can answer, or the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman find them in an obscure corner of Oz. Maybe they disguise themselves as three wise woman characters in your fandom of choice, or talk shop with other triads of wise women; A Wrinkle in Time is an obvious go-to here. Or tell me about the semester they taught at Hogwarts. Modern AUs could also be amazing. 

If you keep it fully canon, I'd love to see what favor Fflewddur Fflam might ask from them, or what he might unexpectedly, unintentionally do for them and earn something surprising in return. Scenes from Dallben's childhood would be lovely too. And it might be interesting to eavesdrop on them one evening as they sit around the fire—what would they joke and bicker and gossip about?

If you don't go AU, my preference is for language and tone that comes as close as possible to the original (which I know is very challenging and I will appreciate any effort in that direction).

Canon-specific DNW: sex or violence beyond what's in canon, sadness, angst, woe.

What's up with this request? Well, I'm fascinated by these little guys. They're horse celebrities. What sort of world has horse celebrities? How do they do their instruments? What are horse concerts like? What does a horse performer do? Are they in the same world as us? Are they aliens? Are they part of a horse culture? Would accept RPF for this one, if done as humour. You can feel free to use any of these instead of all at once.

I'm okay with you focusing on all or none of my horse choices as long as you focus on the concept of the toyline itself!

Likes: Happy endings, adventures, casefic, mysteries, ghosts, kisses, missing scenes.

Good with: Gen, F/F, M/M, F/M, and NB in any configuration with the others.

DNWS: Rape, underage, slavery, incest, and major character death.

Murder, She Wrote
Jessica Fletcher
Grady Fletcher

Further reading: Imbd has this one user who does great summaries of each episode if you go to them directly.
What's up with this request? Mysteries, man! I love them. But it's okay if you don't want to write one, because I like other stuff too! I love Jessica's writing adventures, I love the bits of her backstory (like her raising Grady, her time as a teacher), and her vast network of friends. I am not a fan of Jessica is a Serial Killer meme, but I'm okay for magical realism where she's a herald of death or some sort of avenging angel (and possibly chosen Grady to succeed her). You may notice there are more prompts for Jessica than Grady and if you offered only him, don't worry. You can swap out a lot of Jessica's name for Grady's in these and I'll be just as happy. I love that guy.

Prompts:

&nbsp;

A day for Jessica

Grady visits

Discussion of that time Jessica totally somehow got Grady's wife off for murder (she stabbed him! With a fish! AND LEFT HIM TO DIE)

Book tours

Why Jessica won't learn to drive (There are a thousand valid reasons in RL, but I thought it might make for an interesting prompt)

Christmas cards (especially to the various people who you helped prove the innocence of)

A mystery from Jessica's past

Jessica's time as an English teacher

University class stuff

Grady's upbringing

Grady telling Jessica when he'd sent away her book that starts the first episode

How does Jessica learn to be so unflappable and non-judgmental?

&nbsp;

PS: I didn't ask for Magnum even though he's nominated, but if your heart was set, here's some bonus prompts from my trick or treat letter. Obviously I only expect you to write what we match on:

Magnum has to come to Maine from Hawaii and re-enacts The Cremation of Sam McGee in the Maine winter
Magnum can't stop thinking about Jessica - feel free to include Seth
Magnum has to help out Grady as a favour to Jessica - feel free to include herald of death idea

Good with: Gen, F/F, M/M, F/M, and NB in any configuration with the others.

DNWS: Rape, underage, slavery, incest, and major character death.

(I chose 'any' but here's the characters in the tagset. I will also accept original centaurette characters)

&nbsp;

Bacchus' zebra centaurette attendants (Fantasia 1940)

Blue centaur with black hair (Fantasia 1940)

Blue centaurette with blonde hair (Fantasia 1940)

Green centaurette (Fantasia 1940)

&nbsp;

What I'm concepting for this: This appears to be a magical ancient Greek-type society with no humans. Just gods and mythological creatures. The centaurs clearly have the most society to work from, with the courtship and the festival and the way they interact with the other races.

What I'd like to see is a picture of this as a functional world - maybe with fantasy adventures! I chose my favourite centaurs to be the protagonists of whatever story you choose - the shy blonde blue centaurette, the emotional blue centaur with black hair, the haughty green centaurette, and the really cool zebra centaurettes that seem to work with bacchus. Feel free to use just one or all! Or, as I said, come up with your own! 

What I do not want: Horrible things happening that don't have happy endings.

Prompts:

&nbsp;

Dangers

Quests

Dealings with Gods

Courtship

Dealing with other species

What's outside their world?

What do they do for worship?

Racing

Contests

Romance

Dancing

Unicorns

Pegasus

Fauns

- Vontae gives Sonny and Ali a gift for the baby.
- Vontae babysits.

Everything I Never Told You - Celeste Ng 
Nath Lee (Everything I Never Told You), Jack Wolff (Everything I Never Told You)

I read this book for one of my book clubs earlier this year and completely fell in love with it. I am down with whatever story you want to tell me about Nath and Jack. This is a fandom where I would be okay with something other than a happy ending: Ng is so attuned to history for so much of the book that while I was excited about that one line about Nath and Jack at the end, I also thought, \"In a decade, a significant portion of their generation of gay men will be dead.\"

Some specific things I would read:
- By the time Nath realizes, Jack is already dying.
- Hannah is married with kids and has a generally functional family life. Jack and Nath are the kids' cool gay uncles.
- The ways Nath and Jack's relationship parallels James and Marilyn's, and the ways it doesn't.
- How Nath finds out that Jack wants him.
- The ways Lydia and her absence inform their relationship, or don't.

Home Again (2017) 

This was such a charming figuring out your life/found family movie. I'm not even sure what my ideal story would be here; I really did love everyone and their journeys. I would be happy with pairings/threesomes or found family gen.

Some specific things I would read:
- Harry grows up, and when he's older and has lived through his wild times period, he and Alice have a chance at a relationship that works for both of them.
- George/Teddy, either as its own thing or as part of an Alice/Harry story.
- Found family dinner, either a specific one or some kind of five times type story.
- George/Alice in a future time when he's had time to really live his life and see that this is what he most wants.
- Alice/Harry, George/Alice polyamorous V that may or may not include the George/Alice/Harry threesome that is the way she runs wild one birthday and/or the aftermath of that threesome.
- Something Isabel-centric. Maybe she's grown up and reflecting on her unconventional childhood/telling someone about it/promoting the play/movie/book she wrote based on it. Maybe she's a teenager navigating dating and teenage life with what amounts to five parents. Maybe she and Rosie are comparing their very different memories of the time George, Harry, and Teddy lived with them.
- Alice and Harry are moving on with their separate lives. Her birthday is an exception.

Jane the Virgin (TV) 
Jane Villanueva, Petra Solano, Rafael Solano

I love that this show's setup is completely ridiculous but it works because everyone is so sincere about it. Saturday brunch is the thing that made me want fic about Jane, Petra, and Rafael. I love that once a week they set aside everything else and have brunch as a family, and also what it says about Jane and Petra's relationship. I would be perfectly happy with gen, any pairing involving two of the three of them, any sort of polyamorous V configuration, or threesome fic. Please feel free to fold in any of the other characters too.

Some specific things I would read:
- Anything about Saturday brunch.
- Mateo is a sweet, well-behaved teenager. Anna and Elsa are going through a rebellious phase.
- How Rafael first finds out about Saturday brunch and/or his first brunch with them.
- The negotiation and trial and error involved in making a polyamorous V (with anyone at the center point) work.
- One of them is dating someone who isn't one of the other two. Does the new partner get invited to brunch?

This is one of my all-time favorite books. I would love post-canon fic. If you want to turn their story into something like a space AU, I would be into that. I only requested Meg because she's the only one I absolutely want in a story, but I love everyone, so feel free to include any or all of the other characters.

Some specific things I would read:
- Meg and Peem's wedding night.
- The power dynamics of Meg and Peem's relationship.
- The four of them making their way in Germany.
- Meg, Peem, and Davie handling a young man courting Marie.
- Meg's potential for supernatural powers in the aftermath of Inge's death. Do they require worship of the same god as Inge's, or are they a different type? Does she go it alone, or does she find a mentor/teacher?

This is an OR request.  I'll put more in my letter bc I had a really hard time picking characters here.  Feel free to include Rufus and/or Jiya, and any others, and it does not have to be a Jiya or Rufus-centric story.  So many things interest me about the show and I love (practically) all the characters.  WHAT is up with Jiya -- super powers?  What are Jiya and Agent Christopher up to while the others are gone?  I really LOVE the show's exploration of racism, sexism, and same sex phobias, and other isms so anything you can do there would be wonderful.

神さまのいない日曜日 | Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi | Sunday Without God 

Any nominated character(s): Ai Astin, Dee Ensy Stratmitos, Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich, Scar

Likes: romance, friendship, fluff, slice of life, action, happy endings, bittersweet endings, unrequited love, travel, hurt/comfort, especially h/c in which a character is sick or injured and another takes care of them, and so on.

Do Not Want: rape, dubcon and other forms of abuse, excessive grimdark, outright downer endings, non-canon character death, infidelity, character/pairing/canon-bashing, AUs/alternate universes, second-person POV, crossovers/fusions with series I didn't request, or genderswap. Also, please no unrequested side/background pairings.

Prompts:

Since I'm asking for \"Any\" here, I'll leave individual prompts for the all the nominated characters and the potential ships I like. I loved Ai's journey and the relationships between her and her companions, and I also really love the canon's setting, as it's both beautiful and haunting.

Ai Astin: Ai is naïve and strong, curious and optimistic. What interesting new locations does she visit with her companions after freeing Ostia? What of her dream to save the world? How do her relationships with Alice and Dee change? Maybe some father/daughter-bonding with Julie, or bonding more with Scar over their gravekeeper duties? I'm not too interested in pre-canon works about her, as what I love most is her journey with her new friends.

Dee Ensy Stratmitos: The ghostly witch of the west - how did she became known as Whisper? How did she first realize she could compel others? Did she ever try to find her parents? How much guilt does she feel about nearly trapping her companions in Ostia forever? How do Ai and Alice try to reach out to her afterwards? What kind of relationship would she have with the adults Julie and Scar?

Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich: Being the father-figure of the group, how does Julie care for the others? How does he feel about having a family again? He's the oldest of the group, so how does he see the world as compared to the others? For backstory, there's his life with his wife and daughter (and Julie was quite young when his daughter was born), or you could explore his grief after their deaths.

Scar: How goes her conflict between gravekeeper stoicism and human emotions? How does she define being human? What if the group were to encounter one of her identical gravekeeper \"siblings\"? What more does she learn about motherhood as she cares for baby Celica? Like with Ai I'm not that interested in pre-canon stories about her, and I'm more intrigued by her character development and her relationships with Ai, Celica, and the others.

Ships:
Ai/Dee: They have a tense relationship, but Ai does see Dee as a dear friend, and I'd love to see more. What if Dee fell in love with Ai while observing her as a ghost? How would that affect her initial goal to stay in Ostia forever, and what about after the seal was broken? Or, what if Ai fell in love first? Maybe Dee would flirt with and tease her to get her to realize her feelings?

Julie/Scar: They have a subtle, understated relationship, so would their displays of affection be subtle as well, or would one of them start to be more openly affectionate? Julie has been in love before, but Scar is still new to human emotions, so how would that affect their relationship? Would they ever think of getting married? There's also Celica - how would their bond deepen and mature as they care for her together?

Julie/Dee: This one's a bit unusual, but I really like age gaps, so there's some nice potential there. If Dee fell in love first, how would she go about confessing to Julie? Or you could go for something unrequited, where she keeps her feelings hidden. What if she confided in Ai about her feelings for Julie? Even if Julie did return her feelings, would he hold back, fearing taking advantage of her?

Stray Little Devil 
Akumachi Pam, Linfa

Likes: romance, friendship, fluff, slice of life, action, happy endings, bittersweet endings, unrequited love, travel, hurt/comfort, especially h/c in which a character is sick or injured and another takes care of them, and so on.

Do Not Want: rape, dubcon and other forms of abuse, excessive grimdark, outright downer endings, non-canon character death, infidelity, character/pairing/canon-bashing, AUs/alternate universes, second-person POV, crossovers/fusions with series I didn't request, or genderswap. Also, please no unrequested side/background pairings.

Surprise canon yuri is the best yuri, and I'm a sucker for angel/devil pairings. A cheerful devil and a snobbish angel - what could go wrong? I love Pam's optimism and I love how Linfa slowly opens up to Pam, and Pam's grand rescue of Linfa at the end was just wonderful. Really, I just love how their relationship developed.

Pam/Linfa has a lot of potential - how do they express affection? Is Linfa shy about showing physical affection, or does she surprise Pam? What are their lives like now that the Spirit World and the human world are connected? How do they help with the rebuilding of the Spirit World? Are they still working hard to become a proper angel and a proper devil? How often do they go on dates, and what are their dates like? Does Pam cook often for Linfa, or does Linfa try her hand at cooking for Pam instead? What does Linfa think of the human world? How does she reconcile the Ishtar and Rinka personalities within her? Does Pam worry about comparing Linfa to Rinka? Pam/Linfa is one of my favorite pairings, and the end of canon, while satisfying, left me wanting more.

Venus Versus Virus 
Nahashi Lucia, Takahana Sumire

Likes: romance, friendship, fluff, slice of life, action, happy endings, bittersweet endings, unrequited love, travel, hurt/comfort, especially h/c in which a character is sick or injured and another takes care of them, and so on.

Do Not Want: rape, dubcon and other forms of abuse, excessive grimdark, outright downer endings, non-canon character death, infidelity, character/pairing/canon-bashing, AUs/alternate universes, second-person POV, crossovers/fusions with series I didn't request, or genderswap. Also, please no unrequested side/background pairings.

My favorite thing about this canon is the relationship between Lucia and Sumire. Action with plenty of yuri subtext - how could I refuse? Lucia is the tough one, but she also has a vulnerable side, and while Sumire seems weak and timid at first, she has a kind, strong will and heart, so they compliment each other well.

Are Lucia and Sumire still hunting Viruses, or are they living peacefully now? What if one of them was seriously injured during a mission? Is Sumire doing well in school? Does Lucia help her with her homework? Are they still training and perfecting their elemental powers? Do they spend a lot of time dressing up in beautiful outfits and jewelry? Do they go on picnics often with Nahashi, Lola, and Layla? If you want to write romance, who makes the first move? What is their first date like? Is anybody surprised by the fact they're dating? (Probably not.) How often do they get moments alone together? Are they shy about romance, or are they open about their relationship? Honestly, I really want to see Lucia and Sumire happy together, whether romantically or just as friends.

I'm also interested in how all the Kingdom game characters perceive each other and might interact with each other years down the line, if given the opportunity - and how the members of the Chime who interact with them the most perceive them, having lived through that era. (I don't have enough slots to request Ibex, but I feel it's kind of a given that after a certain point in canon Ibex's shadow hangs pretty consistently over both Orth and Aria, so let's just pretend I did?)

Batreaux is a monster whose presence disrupts certain aspects of life on Skyloft, but what exactly does it mean that he is a \"monster\"? When the player finally encounters Demise, he is not the mindless rampaging evil that he's made out to be, so why did he and Hylia have to fight each other? Essentially, I'm interested in a story told from a different perspective.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 

I would love to read a story in which Link becomes friends with some of the monsters in Breath of the Wild, who seem to possess a fairly high degree of sentience and intelligence. This could be a silly story with light humor arising from miscommunication and shenanigans, or it could be something more tragic that offers a deeper examination of the worldview and lore of the game, especially in relation to the nature and influence of Calamity Ganon.

Dark Tower - Stephen King 
Roland Deschain (Dark Tower - Stephen King), The Man in Black (Dark Tower - Stephen King)

I was always interested in the relationship between Roland and Walter; but, after the cinematic adaptation of The Dark Tower that came out this summer, I'm embarrassed to admit that now I sort of ship them. What fascinates me is the strong suggestion that, while Roland loses his memories every time he resets the universe, Walter is able to remember everything that's happened and can also travel between different timelines. What I'd therefore love to see is a bit of Roland's story told from Walter's perspective. Tragedy is okay, smut is okay, and creeping insanity is okay as well.

No Game No Life - Kamiya Yuu 
Sora (No Game No Life), Shiro (No Game No Life)

The fact that Shiro and Sora literally cannot be separated from each other is one of the dynamics that I like about the series. I really enjoy codependent siblings as a Thing. So I would be happy if you played with that dynamic. Plotty gen for this series would be great-- it's always fun when one of them is much better than the other or they have to separate and execute plans while relying solely on the intuition of what their sibling will do. Alternately, someone kidnapping Sora and Shiro having to play a game to get him back while they both battle their inability to get anything done alone...

I'd love background on them, where they tried to separate or were forced to separate and failed to function, or where one or the other tried to interact with other people (maybe a gamer who tracked them down) but were either terrible at it, the other one quietly sabotaged the budding relationship,  or the third person got way too freaked out by the way Sora and Shiro act around each other.

Future fic would also be great-- King/Queen Blank or even the Gods Blank, after they've beaten Tet. What does that look like? What kind of world are they making for themselves and each other?

I ship them, but do not expect other people to, so if you want to write shippy fic (with aged up Shiro!!!) for them, I will be surprised but happy. I will happily admit to wanting kinky sex games.

Dragon Prince Trilogy - Melanie Rawn 
Ianthe of Princemarch, Sioned of River Run

I've always thought that Ianthe had a serious hate-crush on Sioned and part of the reason she was so vicious and fucked up was that whole \"you must marry a guy and expand the empire or your useless\" thing when maybe she didn't want to do that. Ianthe's always been one of my favorite characters because she's brilliant and ruthless and clearly takes joy in clever plans that go well. Of course, being the villain in a cheesy fantasy, she got no depth whatsoever, aside from that whole sexually liberated, taking male consorts thing (which is AWESOME, okay.) Sioned is also awesome and brilliant and kick ass. Her hesitance in the first book while she decided what she really wanted to do was pretty great, as was the fact that she promptly made friends with Tobin and pretty much every character not designated \"villain\". It seems like up through Ianthe's death, they're playing a game of brinkmanship. (Which isn't to say I don't like Sioned and Rohan together. They're bookTP and totally awesome.)

&nbsp;

As for prompts, I normally prefer plotty fic to introspection. I feel like the whole sunrunner thing lends itself well to espionage, so political thriller, or murder mysteries or something would be great. If you want to do plot-what-plot involving these two-- either sex or just the sort of dancing around/pigtail pulling that would be great. Threesomes with Rohan-- also acceptable! Hell, if you want to do an AU where they end up together instead of Sioned marrying Rohan-- or alternately, an AU end to the trilogy, where Ianthe never died in the fire and ends up taking over as High Princess and making the Desert monarchs' lives hell and discovering her powers. Or something where she knew about her powers all along. Or Sioned, I don't know, realizing she kind of did think Ianthe was attractive.

I also really enjoy Pandsala, but I didn't find her dynamic with Sioned and Rohan quite as engaging, even though she also did some bad-ass stuff in the long run. Her weird push and pull backstabby, politicized sisterly thing was interesting, though.

GetBackers 
Midou Ban, Amano Ginji

WHY HELLO THERE, NOSTALGIA FANDOM. I ship Ban and Ginji, as is right and correct and good, and I just want... everything. To do with them. Like, Ban seducing the Raitei to his side, and showing Ginji that there's more to life and love and emotion than he'd ever thought. Or their early attempts at finding jobs. Or just idk hanging out, being aggressively THEM. 

Other plot ideas include host club AUs, or mafia AUs or Gangsta AUs, or something long and plotty that involves big fights and dealing with their traumas while getting back something massive and important.

I also accept hurt/comfort and something something lightening and chains because heaven knows all the promo art used to have Ginji all tied up and shit. Or Ginji somehow being regressed to his Raitei mindset and Ban putting himself in danger (sexy danger) and getting hurt to snap Ginji out of it. Then there's sex. Also, do they have sex in the car? How does that work? It's so SMALL.

And if you REALLY want to indulge me, write a fic based on the premise of this Getbackers pseudo-movie promo with angels and demons and shit: https://m.gofanfiction.club/s/2176539/1/Get-Backers-In-Nomine-Get-Back-The-Name-of-God

EOS 10 (Podcast) 

I just. This series is so funny and it works so well and WHY IS THERE NO THIRD SEASON YET. I need a third season, or at least some plotty adventures to tide me over. I didn't as for any particular characters because I love them all deeply-- including the characters not in the tag set, so if you decide you'd rather write about Dr Urvidian, Frontier Medicine Man, or about The Interface's slow recognition of its own self-awareness and enjoyment of jerking people around, I'm so down.

Some Akmazian backstory, or Akmazian and Ryan trying to negotiate some sort of date-like thing even though Akmazian is a terrorist on the run and Ryan isn't even sure he likes the guy (hint: he likes the guy) would be nice. Maybe they go out to a planet and something goes horribly wrong because something ALWAYS goes horribly wrong, and they end up closer.

 Jane is wonderful and sweet and let me see a day in her life and all of the horrible bs she has to handle as a nurse in this crazy place. Also give Jane a love interest, YOU COWARDS. She is beautiful and wonderful and doesn't deserve your shit. Maybe she can go solve mysteries with the dubious help of Levi and the Quartermaster while Ryan and Urvidian are off doing their usual bullshit.

AS FOR LEVI. a) I want him to be Jewish. Not for any reason, just because his name's Levi and I think it's hilarious. b) I would love to see him just end up taking over EOS 10 for a day or a week before someone wrangles him down. My favorite thing about him is that he's so off-handed about his violence. He's great manipulator when it comes to politics, and iron-fisted ruler, and a complete dweeb in interpersonal reaction. Please, for the love of god, more Levi.

selector infected WIXOSS 
Urazoe Iona | Yuki, Aoi Akira, Igarashi Rumi | Ulith

So, you know how in my \"general likes\" I said I don't like \"gratuitous angst\"? In this fandom, there is no such thing as \"gratuitous\". Darkfic is absolutely welcome here. The thing I am most interested in here is the manipulative, awful relationship that Akira has with Iona and Ulith-as-Iona. Like, I love them all, and for some reason in this fandom, that comes out to \"please break them\".

Exploring their adult lives and how their relationships and the Wixoss game affected them in the future would be amazing. What else happened to them? What are their careers like? What are their home lives like? Are they... living together? Does some sort of magic continue to be a theme in their lives?

Feel free to write in-universe plot or no-powers universe, or some horrible Madoka or Yurikuma Arashi  or other magical girl thing, where they can all be horribly manipulative lesbians together because that's magical and wonderful. 

OTOH, if you want to write codependent-but-vaguely-functional adult Akira and Iona/Ulith being horrible assholes and having adventures of some sort (magic, detectives, idk) that is ALSO A+. I mean, I like happy endings, and if you can come up with something heartwarming ( or \"heartwarming\") I'm not going to complain.

Yoroiden Samurai Troopers | Ronin Warriors 
Shuu Rei Fuan | Kento Rei Fang, Mouri Shin | Cye Mouri

I love Shuu/Shin with Shin being snarktastic and Shuu being smug and solid and dependable. 

I used to frequent the Minkland archive back when this fandom still kinda existed, and was forever disappointed that the skinny pretty boys got tons and tons of fic and Shuu was just sort of there in the background. (If you used to read Mink and Jink's fic, I will be so happy I could cry if I got that sort of cracked-out porny fic with Shuu, okay. Due to that formative influence, if you want to GO FOR THE AU, GO FOR IT WITH GUSTO. I've always wanted nanshoku/samurai AU. Or, you know, hooker fic, or dark!troopers fic, or harem fic or something like that.

I also like found-family fic, gen-ish mysteries and adventures-- more fighting Massive Cosmic Evil, and curtainfic. Futurefic is also awesome, where they get on with their lives, maybe together or maybe trying to keep their friendships intact when there's no massive Cosmic Evil to keep them close.
