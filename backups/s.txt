The Chimes - Anna Smaill 
Simon Wythern, Lucien (The Chimes)

I'm very easy-going with fic. I enjoy hurt/comfort and angst (but with a happy ending). I love character studies and slice of life fic. I don't enjoy rape/rape recovery fics, and am squicked by self-harm - so if you decide to go down a h/c or angst route, I'd rather those elements didn't show up. 

I enjoyed this book so much and would be so excited for there to be literally any fic at all for it. I only nominated Lucien and Simon, and they are at the heart of the book for me, but I would be delighted at any of the other characters from the book that you want to bring in.

Some prompts which may spark inspiration: We only get a small portion of the narrowboat journey to Oxford - maybe expand on the tentative first steps in the new intimacy Lucien and Simon find during it, or something about the evolution of their relationship from Callum or Jemima's point of view. What happens After? Do Simon and Lucien go back to Dog Isle and the Five Rover Pact? Do they find Clare again? Do they stay in Oxford? What kind of life do the build for themselves of what's left?

References to canon acts of self-harm are fine for this fandom.

Kabukibu! (Anime) 
Akutsu Shin, Ebihara Jin

I'm very easy-going with fic. I enjoy hurt/comfort and angst (but with a happy ending). I love character studies and slice of life fic. I don't enjoy rape/rape recovery fics, and am squicked by self-harm - so if you decide to go down a h/c or angst route, I'd rather those elements didn't show up. 

I enjoy kabuki and this anime combines my love of that with ridiculous slice of life high school hijinks. One of the things that I find interesting about kabuki is how ritualised it is, the dynastic traditions and the training that the kabuki actors go through, including the role of onnagata. So consequently I am really fascinated by the relationship between Akutsu and Ebihara. I would be completely happy with that being taken in a m/m direction if that works for you, but a gen focused character study would be equally welcome as well. I would be happy for any characters from the series to feature alongside them in the fic as well!

Prompts which may spark inspiration: If they'd done the Obo and Ojo scene two more times, Akutsu said he'd have fallen in love with Ebihara - what if that happened? What happens for the gang next school year, does Akutsu draw Ebihara in for more club activities? Does Ebihara draw Akutsu in to more formal study of kabuki? What about the the more distant future - what are they doing in 10 years time?

I'd be intrigued by a historical AU here as well. What would the relationship be like between them back in the Edo period?

Please do not feel that you have to go and do masses of research into kabuki traditions and history, I'm prepared to handwave a lot and I'm by no means an expert myself.

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Roberto Nicholas, Hiraga Josef Kou

I'm very easy-going with fic. I enjoy hurt/comfort and angst (but with a happy ending). I love character studies and slice of life fic. I don't enjoy rape/rape recovery fics, and am squicked by self-harm - so if you decide to go down a h/c or angst route, I'd rather those elements didn't show up. 

This show has been a delicious wild ride of cracky joy for me. I don't know what I went in expecting, but I was totally won over by the ridiculous co-dependent domesticity of Roberto and Hiraga. I'm fine with whatever other characters you want to bring in additional to who I've nominated. I very much love the image of a slightly oblivious Hiraga with Lauren and Roberto engaged in a subtle yet passive-aggressive battle for his attentions.

Prompts which may spark inspiration: Case fic and the interesting places they travel to? The next accidental cocaine-fuelled mishap? Slice of life fluff around cooking? What's typical for how they spend their time in the Vatican when they're not investigating? Chirstmas-themed fic - it's obviously a very big deal in the Vatican, how do they celebrate at home or are they away for it?

If you want to go for an angsty introspective look at their feelings for each other and how that aligns with their religious obligations, then I would be very very interested to read that. I don't mind if you make the Catholic church one that is kinder on LGBT matters, but whatever you write I would prefer you not to handwave the demands of clerical celibacy.

I love both the ordinariness and the intensity of this anime. The relationships between the three main characters - both as a whole and as pairs within that - are a big part of what makes this series so great for me. I'd be happy with explorations of that from a gen, m/m, m/f or OT3 perspective. I loved Jun's journey throughout the series as well and I'd be more than happy if you wanted to include him (or anyone else) as well.

Prompts which may spark inspiration: Fruitless pining in the post-series/pre-epilogue period? Expansion of Sen and Kaoru's trip to Tokyo? The three of them doing ordinary stuff while they were all still at school together? Something post-epilogue - what happened once they were reunited?

I keep requesting this, living in hope that eventually some brave soul will take it on. If that is you, omg, I love you already! 

Okay, so, OT3 polyamory is a thing that I love, but it's not even slightly required here. What I would really absolutely ADORE is OT3 spy hijinks for the Queen, possibly on the Continent, with or without Kit having faked his own death (ahaha, Deptford, whatever! Most unlikely faked death story ever). Go full political intrigue if that's your jam. Or feel free to take it AU -- let Annie wear the pants, literally or not. If you want, let them all be wizards, vampires, or any other thing that fits roughly into the Elizabethan period. Let them meet pirates and try to talk their way out of capture (hah), or end up sailing to the Colonies (east or west) in quest of...something, IDK. Really, I just want hijinks &amp; all three of them getting along marvelously. Early Modern English is obviously NOT required.

This was the first time Anne of Green Gables won me over. &lt;3  I love this adaptation with my whole heart.  No ships this time; I'd rather just have friendship fic for this fandom.

I love, love, love Anne.  She’s had such a hard life and I just want her to be happy!  I love her relationship with the Cuthberts (Anne Cuthbert-Shirley!!! my heart!!!) and her friendship with Diana and her weird contentious friendship with Jerry.  (I also like her budding relationship with Gilbert, and I don’t mind him as a supporting character, but I’d rather focus on the other characters for now.)  Anything involving her and the people in her life would be great, whether it’s her bonding with them more, a missing scene, or her making the best of a bad situation.  

And Diana is also delightful!  I love her friendship with Anne and I love how carefully she has to tread the line to keep that friendship but also keep her social standing within the school- and keep her parents’ approval.  Her head isn’t in the clouds like Anne’s is, and she’s much more pragmatic about some things than Anne is, but she’s still willing to be pulled along on Anne’s imaginings and have fun.  

And finally, Jerry.  I’m so glad he has an expanded part in this show, because he is fantastic!  I love his weird not-quite friendship with Anne, and how it highlights their class difference.  But mostly I just love him and Anne snarking and bickering (and him doing most of it in French so she can’t understand).  More of their unlikely friendship, please!  Anything where they have to team up for a task or where one of them helps the other in secret would be especially great.

Ella Enchanted was such an important book to me when I was growing up- it was the first fantasy I read besides Narnia, and it was the first fairy tale retelling I read.  It's the first book I turn back to whenever I get depressed, because it always lifts me up.

I love, love, love Ella &amp; Arieda's friendship.  I love that they are both outsiders at finishing school that manage to find each other, and my heart always breaks when Ella has to leave Arieda.  I would love an AU where they fall in love, and that's how Ella eventually breaks her curse.  (I'm not 100% sure how that would work with Hattie's order, but if you can think of a way...)  I'd also love post-canon fic featuring these two, either friendship fic or femslash fic. (Fairest takes place in Ayortha, Arieda's home country, and is about Arieda's sister.  I've read it, though it doesn't hold my heart like Ella Enchanted does.  Feel free to crib from it, or not.)

I also love Ella/Char-- they have a lovely relationship in canon, and I would love to see more.  Maybe something where Ella meets Char's parents and sister as herself, not as Lela?  Or something featuring the two of them going on adventures together.  Or just a moment with them walking through the royal menagerie together or sliding down stair rails or something else ridiculous.

I've also been thinking about Ella/Char/Arieda lately.  We don't get a lot of Char &amp; Arieda interaction in the book-- only a journal entry from Char recounting their conversation about Ella, but I think they would get along if Arieda wasn't treating him so much like a prince.  So I'd love something post-canon where Arieda visits her friends in Frell and ~feelings~ happen between the three of them.

I'd also like something from Mandy's point of view.  What is it like, being the godmother to all the women in Ella's family for so long?  What kind of hidden magics does she normally do?  Was there ever a time when she did \"big magic\", like Lucinda?  Or anything that focuses on the relationship between her and Ella, especially once Ella's father is remarried and Dame Olga is in the picture, would be lovely.

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS UP TO 2.03

I love all the supporting characters in this show, so please include them!  I just really want the fic to also be Eleanor-centric.  Kirsten Bell is &lt;3 and Eleanor manages to straddle the line between selfish and lovable just perfectly-- even when she has to relearn all her character development!

This show is the best show on television right now.  I love the crazy twists, how meta it got with the beginning of the second season, the Groundhog Day stuff happening, the jokes and philosophical pondering mixing.  I know how hard it can be to write for an ongoing canon and that anything here could be jossed at any point before reveals, but please don’t sweat it!  If you want to play with any of the versions of canon we get (canon AUs! Soulmates Eleanor and Tahani, if only for a moment!), then go for it!  If you want to go full-out crazy, go for it!  (Actually, full-out crazy is probably best for this canon?)

As far as specific prompts? I would love views of the different “resets”-- how do they figure it out?  How do they find each other?  Seriously, what was that one where Eleanor and Tahani were soulmates like?  WHO SEDUCED MICHAEL THAT ONE TIME?  (Was it Jason?  Because he would have been down, and Eleanor would totally have made him do it.)  Going forward, I’m looking forward to our four humans (and Janet!) teaming up with Michael.  Or...anything.  Honestly, I don’t know what’s going to happen from week to week!  Please feel free to write in missing scenes or canon divergence AUs or whatever!  

One fair warning: while I do ship Chidi/Eleanor (and everyone else), I ship them as unlikely friends-turned-lovers.  I’m not into them as Perfect Forever Soulmates.  (But if you want to explore the flawed idea of soulmates in this canon, I would also be down with that!)

I have loved A Little Princess since childhood, and I was super psyched when I found out about this game (from the makers of Long Live the Queen, even!).  It did not disappoint!  It's charming and sweet and sad and hopeful all at once.  And it's yuri!!!

Sara is so delightful. &lt;3  She's so optimistic and such a dreamer, and it's so heartbreaking when things get bad for her.  The bit after her imaginary feast with Becky and Ermengarde is broken up is always one of the saddest parts, to me-- she looks around, and she can't imagine any more.  I would love some post-canon fic here!  The game presents some AU options that aren't present in the novel; I'd love to see some of the adventures that Sara takes with one of the other girls after Mr. Carraway finds her.  Or maybe she does become a governess and leave Miss Minchin's, like she thought about in the Mariette storyline?  Or post-canon fic where Sara visits Ermengarde at her aunt's house would be lovely. Or maybe a canon divergent fic, about what might have happened if Mr. Carraway had never found Sara?  

Becky is my favorite in the book, and she's my favorite in the game.  I love how she and Sara support each other, even (especially) when they have no one else.  Post-canon fic where they're together and living happy lives would be great (maybe Becky gets to wear pretty pink dresses, too?).  

I really loved how the game expanded on Jessie, and I'd also love post-canon fic about Jessie and Sara travelling and having adventures together!  Alternatively, the Mariette storyline has Sara thinking about becoming a governess and leaving Miss Minchin's, while in the Jessie storyline, Sara doesn't seem to see a way out for either of them.  Maybe that's their way out?  Maybe they find a placement at some nice school or house somewhere, and live happily-ever-after (or happily-for-now).  In this universe, does Mr. Carraway ever find Sara?  (It's okay if he doesn't, as long as Jessie and Sara find happiness in some form.)

Lavinia has issues.  Like, capital-I issues.  In fact, she's kind of a terrible person!  But I kind of got attached to her by the end of her route anyway.  Anything post-canon would be great, especially if Lavinia continues to grow as a person.  (Though, don't sand away all the rough edges!)  I'd also love a compromise between her ending and Jessie's, where she and Sara and Jessie are all happy together (or mostly happy, at least).

This book is among my favorite of L.M. Montgomery's books, though I seem to be in the minority even among her fans. While it does have a few problems (one of the subplots gets hella racist), I love this book and all of the characters.  I had a truly terrible time narrowing my nominations down to just 4 characters (poor Gay Penhallow and Aunt Becky just couldn't make the cut), but please don't let that stop you!  I will take fic about basically anyone except the Sams.

In general, I'd like to read something about the characters post-canon.  I want to hear about Margaret, now that she's finally got her little house and has adopted Brian.  The rest of the clan probably gives her an awful time about being jilted by Penny- or do they?  If you are up for it, I would especially like a story where Margaret falls in love with a woman. I can definitely see Margaret as a lesbian.

We saw a little of how Jocelyn started to rebuild her life with Hugh after her awful mistake; how do they go on?  (Headcanon alert: Jocelyn always seems to me to be a very blunt person; I've always headcanoned her to be more like the Next Coming of Aunt Becky than anyone else.  But with a bit more empathy.)  Are things suddenly just better?  Does Jocelyn get bored with Hugh again and look somewhere else, or do they make it work?

And Donna and Peter- tell me all about their adventures together as a couple! I'd also be interested in Donna's friendship with Virginia, before and after Donna's second marriage. Or maybe an AU where Donna and Peter don't fall in love, but instead Donna and Virginia's pledge of eternal widowhood is partly because the two of them are in love?

Nan gets kind of villainized in the book- which is understandable!  She steals Gay's fiance!  But she's also a very modern young woman coming back to a very old-fashioned clan, and her mores don't match up.  I would love anything with Nan having whirlwind adventures in the big city, or with her adjusting to living back home in a small town where everyone knows everyone.  And if some of Nan's adventures involve her making out with other women, I would totally be down with that!  An AU where she ends up ~seducing~ Gay and the two of them have a very scandalous relationship would also be welcome!

Alex Benedict - Jack McDevitt 
Christopher Sim (Alex Benedict Series), Leisha Tanner (Alex Benedict Series)

Dear Yuletide author,

first of all: thank you very much indeed for offering to write in one of my three fandoms! I realize that I ramble on a bit below in the details, but feel free to disregard whatever of it that hinders your creativity - they're really only suggestions and ideas, and should not be limitations to your writing. I am very aware of the optional details being optional, but in case your creativity is helped by me going into a bit more detail, here you go!

My general likes and dislikes are as follows:

I like: \"lost moments\" (=pivotal moments to a character that the book skips over), happy endings, romance, plot, character exploration.
I dislike: noncon, character death, incest, underage sex, unhappy endings, kink. I'd prefer not to get a PWP/sex story.
My preferred ratings are G, PG-13 or R, although NC-17 is also fine with me.

&nbsp;

Now, about this particular request - \"A Talent for War\" offers us these tantalizing glimpses into the past, of the resistance and the characters involved there, and we know from the epilogue that Walford Chandler's \"lost pilot\" did indeed find Christopher Sim on Belamoncourt and brought him home, but we never get any scene of or glimpse at Leisha Tanner and Christopher Sim actually interacting. We know they must have, as she ended up joining his staff, and clearly cared enough to go looking for him ... but ... .

So, write me a scene between the two, please? Can be from any point in time in their relationship - first meeting, during resistance times, Leisha finding him on Belamoncourt, sometime after she brought him home ... any scene, any time, is fine. (And I don't mind if you see their relationship as colleagues, friends, or romantically...)

Liaden Universe - Sharon Lee & Steve Miller 
Lomar Fasholt, Shan yos'Galan

I've read Conflict of Honors a couple times by now, and I've always wondered what the future adventures of Lomar Fasholt (and her daughters?) might be, and I basically am curious to know what you think will happen next to her. :-)

Does she take Shan Yos'Galan up on his offer to go live on some other planet and to get Korval's help to set up her business in some other place, once life on Irrobi gets too resticting to sustain? Where does she go? Does she take her daughters along? What happens to her? Does she rock the place, or struggle, or ...?

If you want her to interact with any of the other Korval/Liaden universe characters, that is fine with me - I have nothing against them whatsoever - I just really want to know what happens next to Lomar Fasholt, which is why I requested her - but given that she might become business partners with Korval having whichever one of them in there is 10'000% fine with me, too (that is why I added Shan, given that he seems like her logical point of contact... but if Lomar takes you somewhere else or you need more of the Korval characters to show up for your fic to work that is fine too). Just: Lomar's future, what's it like?

Draft Day (2014) 
Sonny Weaver Jr., Ali Parker

Sooo ... what happens after the end of the movie, between these two? Give me the shmoop, the fluff, the romance (or the plotty plotty fic, if you prefer that) ... I can't believe there's no a single \"Draft Day\" fic yet! Let's change that!
(Or wasn't, at the time I type this).

Fly By Night Series - Frances Hardinge 
Mosca Mye, Eponymous Clent

I would prefer gen only for \"Fly By Night,\" please.

What I like about this canon: The language and worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is so vivid. (But it's also fairly dark; it's the colorful, imaginitive kind of dark that I imagine might have happened if Scott Lynch had tried to write \"The Gentleman Bastards\" sequence for a YA audience.) The way that the series explores the importance of words and language and ideas also strongly resonates with me. But I also just adore Mosca. She's been dealt a bad hand is so angry about it. I love it when we get to see her learning new things and running full-speed with the knowledge. Her friendship with Clent is also great. They're both untrusting, down-on-their-luck tricksters who love language. I adore the fact that they spent a good portion of Fly By Night mistrusting each other, until the point where Mosca realizes <i>Clent didn't kill Partridge</i> and Clent realizes that <i>Mosca actually thought he killed Partridge</i> and they both went <i>oh shit that other person is just as scared as I am</i>. They're both too suspicious and pragmatic to admit to wanting or having friends, but that's what they are. I don't see Clent as a father-figure to Mosca (partially because I think she would reject one and partially because of his comment in Flytrap about forgetting that \"[her] small size is the result of youth, not pickling\"), but I can see him as sort of a mentor.

Story suggestions:
-    Mosca and Clent spend some time on the road discussing scandalous uses of an illegal printing press that they would never ever try. (Bonus, if you want to add Plot: this is fine until the moment one of these never-ever discussions is their only option to get out of trouble. Maybe they need to distract the authorities or frame someone else as the owner of a printing press. Maybe they need to sway public opinion. Maybe they need to evacuate a town and think scaring everyone into leaving is the way to do it. Maybe they're delivering misinformation to armies working against Mandelion.)

-    Mosca and Clent accidentally get hired to run a mayoral election campaign. Does Clent try to escape at the first chance or does he welcome the opportunity? How does Mosca feel about democracy as a variation on governance? Are the guilds interfering the election and if so, how? When Clent and Mosca start succeeding, does that put them at risk of being murdered?

The Goblin Emperor - Katherine Addison 
Maia Drazhar, Csethiro Ceredin

What I like about this canon: The characters. Oh god the characters. I love the setting and the politics and the intricacies of formal/informal pronouns, but none of it would ring quite as clearly if we weren't getting it through the characters. I especially like Maia. He's so good at reading people and resisting manipulation, and he's trying so hard to do the right thing. (I like fish-out-of-water stories and competence-porn stories and oh-god-I-got-an-affection-what-does-it-do? stories and The Goblin Emperor is ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.) I also really like Csethiro. She seems much less adept at people-ing than Maia is, judging from her remark about \"having the sense to not scare [him.]\" But once she realizes that she might like him, she tries. (Stilted emotional displays from stabbity people who are trying very hard not to socially mis-step are yet another trope I adore.)

Story suggestions:
Someone tries to kill Maia (again), giving Csethiro the opportunity to Stab Someone For Love that she keeps missing out on. (Alternately, Csethiro has a Conversation with the nohecharei about the fact that they keep Getting There First, Dammit.)

    Csethiro and the Great Avar get along disturbingly well, and Maia isn't used to people scheming about his safety and happiness this much.

    What does an empress (or empress-to-be) do? Does Csethiro have any political power? Does she help wrangle the nobles' social intricacies? Does she use non-political angles (socialing, gathering information--or, since this is Csethiro, possibly dueling) to help solve delicate political problems (such as the intersection of the imperial tax code with unusual deaths or an attempt to unionize airship pilots or sorting out who's liabile for a batch of tainted flour that got into bread).

The Legend of Drizzt Series - R. A. Salvatore 
Artemis Entreri, Dwahvel Tiggerwillies, Jarlaxle Baenre

What I like about this canon: The characters, especially Entreri, Jarlaxle, Dwahvel, Dahlia, and Sharlotta. (And Drizzt and Catti-bri, depending on how they're written.) I especially like fic set in the sellswords era (Silent Blade through Road of the Patriarch), the Legacy/Starless Night era, and after Gauntlgrym.

Entreri and Jarlaxle are my favorites and I ship the heck out of them. Things I like about them: Ruthless pragmatism and communications issues up the wazoo. They keep trying to manipulate each other and (especially in Jarlaxle's case) it keeps making things worse. I like to think that they will eventually get to a point of trusting each other, but I recognize that there will probably be some stabbing along the way. (I have a weakness for characters that are too pragmatic to want emotional attachments getting emotional attachments anyway and not knowing what to do with them.)

I also really like Dwahvel. She's smart, she's practical, and I get the sense that she probably compartmentalizes the heck out of her emotions. (Given how much she works with Entreri after he kills Dondon, either she had very complicated feelings about her cousin or she can compartmentalize like a mofo. Probably both.) She has to walk a very delicate line in order to keep her much smaller guild safe, and yet she chooses to align herself with Entreri, who seems prone to destablizing everything he touches. I'd love to see more day-to-day stuff about how she runs her guild or how she got started. (And if you wanted to ship her with Sharlotta I wouldn't complain...)

I understand that getting all three of my requested characters in the same fic may make writing a bit frustrating, so you have my explicit permission to omit one.&nbsp;

character bashing
Idalia's Flute treated as a positive/healthy influence

Story suggestions:
During the Servant of the Shard roadtrip, Jarlaxle tries seduction as a tactic to get the shard back and it doesn't work. Later, when he flirts with Entreri after the Shard is destroyed, Entreri's first reaction is to assume this is a trick and flirt back in the most obstructive manner possible, partially because it's fun--let's be honest, this is barely a deviation from their existing banter--and partially to figure out Jarlaxle's angle. This leads to mutually annoyed sexual tension and what can only be described as a war of escalation on both sides. It's up to you if they actually manage to get past aggressive flirting and into bed.

    Jarlaxle and Dwahvel finally get to meet (either during an AU sellswords era where they end up back in Calimport or after RotP when Jarlaxle inevitably tries something foolish to talk to Entreri). How would they get along? Would they compare their (rather similar) tactical choices? I can't imagine Dwahvel got a very flattering impression of him from Entreri's description of the Crystal Shard problems. If they meet after the events of Road of the Patriarch, does Dwahvel want to get as much information as she can or just get him to go the fuck away? Is Entreri there and, if so, is he helping steer the conversation or just enjoying the show?

     Any sort of backstory fic where the characters are plotting their way to the top would be fun. (How did Dwahvel set up her guild in the Copper Ante? What happened with that partner--Tallan Belmer--that Entreri apparently had and then killed? Surely Bregan D'aerthe has gotten betrayed by their employers at least once--how would that go down?)

    If you're familiar with the later canon, I'd love to see some canon divergence and/or time travel fic regarding the debacle with Charon's Claw and the Netherese.

Swordspoint Series - Ellen Kushner 
Katherine Talbert, Artemisia Fitz-Levi

What I like about this canon: I love the setting and the exploration we get in canon of Katherine's place in society. I also really like politics and swordfighting. I like that we get Katherine exploring who she is. I like Artemisia gets the chance to do the same (even though we don't get as much of her doing so from the canon). I also just like this series for the asthetic. It's pretty. What I really want from fic about these two is a continuation of the emotional journeys they started in Privilege of the Sword. (And maybe some porn. I wouldn't say no to porn.)

Prompts (these are suggestions, not requirements):
Femslash, getting-together fic for Katherine and Artemisia. During Privilege of the Sword, Katherine isn't sure if she'd want to kiss Artemisia--what makes her decide that she does? They can fall pretty easily into flirting with each other via The Swordsman Whose Name Was Not Death references, but how do they get past that point? How does Artemisia navigate her own feelings, both about sex and propriety? Does Katherine figure everything out on her own or does she find someone (such as the Black Rose) to ask for advice?

    How does Katherine's ability to stab people affect Hill politics? Do swordsmen come back into style as a sincere safeguard against assassination? Do other nobles accuse her of being willing to indiscriminately attack her political rivals? Do they keep underestimating her until the day she needs to make a point? (Bonus points for Artemisia helping with the social scene end of whatever is going on.)

Alternately, if you're familiar with Tremontaine, I would also love fic about any of the ladies from that.  (Especially Ixkaab/Diane.) Diane actually realizing what All These Emotions are and turning her considerable powers of manipulation in that direction would be a delight.

They didn't get enough time, so I want to invite you to take as much of it as you want here. Give me his backstory, and show me how it was always leading to this.

I'm guilty of Steve/Diana shipping, mostly because I have convinced myself that Steve is a total virgin and Diana is his first, and I would very much like something that reflects that fact. The smuttier the better.

Superstore (TV) 
Jonah Simms, Amy Dubanowski, Garrett McNeill, Cheyenne Lee

DNW: rape, non-con, dub con, blood play, a/b/o, scat, watersports, bdsm, first person, dialogue only, zombies, apocalypses, post-apocalypses, rigid gender binaries, ableism, transphobia, fatphobia, racism, anti-semitism, non canon setting au, animal/pet death, non canonical character death, soulmate/soul marks au, supernatural elements, and very very very specifically: not very Jewish Jonah. Or a story centered on Hanukkah or Christmas. 

I want super Jewish Jonah. (I am Jewish.) No Jonah has a non-Jewish parent, I mean Jonah's super Jewish all the way back to his great great great grandparents, bar mitzvah'd, going to synagogue for the high holy days, Jew Jew Jew Jonah. If you aren't Jewish, feel free to make it a background thing, just as long as he isn't putting up a Christmas tree or talking about going to church. 

I love the politics in the show, Jonah's kind of over the top pretentious hipster politics, the way no one ever calls Dina or Sandra or Justine fat or unhealthy. I am super duper Jonah/Amy OTP and while the show is certainly going to take its time getting them together while Amy finds herself, which is great, but we have fanfiction for getting them together earlier. I really love Jonah and Garrett's friendship, and Amy and Cheyenne's friendship. I love the whole cast, honestly, except for Bo, but we can only have 4, so. 

I realize it hasn't come across a lot here, but while Jonah's my favorite, Amy is nearly my favorite, just a smidge difference there. (Also, canon evolves, etc, but I am pretty sure I don't want Jonah's obstacle love interest that will be introduced by the time you read this as an assignment - I don't want her near my story.)

I usually don't do the whole specific request thing, but I desperately want a different POV on Cole and Alison in s3. Clearly, it's the Affair, canon is fluid and wildly different from POV to POV and I like that, I am the person who loves when it's nearly impossible to reconcile one POV's events to another. I love the whole concept of the show. I'd love to see how Luisa sees Alison and Cole in s3, specifically. (Also, I love both Cole and Alison and Luisa in their complexities and don't think Cole is a psychopath or something.) I don't have an OTP per se on the show, except I don't want Alison and Noah together or Noah in general at all.

One time I wrote a story where he died from falling satellite parts. I hate him.) I'd really love any story with Pacey/Joey in love. For this fandom I really love the kind of AUs where one thing different happens, like, Pacey stays with cooking, or Joey and Pacey actually have sex on the boat.

The Champions (TV) 
Craig Stirling, Richard Barrett, Sharron Macready

“Telepathic pain” is how they describe it, when one gets hurt and the others feel it. I love that when Richard kisses a girl, Craig smiles. I love that their partnership is professional, but that they care about each other. I love the fact that the three of them are so intertwined, psychically.

I’d really love a fic that showcases that relationship. It could a fic where they realise that they will always be the most important people in each other lives and live happily ever after together, either in a sexy threesome, or in a platonic co-dependant way. Or a mission fic with lots of hurt/comfort and depending on each other.

I haven't nominated Tremayne because I didn't want you to feel you have to include him, but I do enjoy him so if none of the ideas above inspire you, I’d also love a fic where Tremayne Finds Out, because Big Reveals are always awesome.

Edgar (Regular Guys), Christoph Schwenk

I would love to see Chris realise that he CAN be gay for Edgar. Maybe having him ineptly attempt to woo Edgar might be fun? Or if you have another idea you’d like to run with, that’s awesome too. I generally prefer character driven rather than PWPs - I like sex scenes as much as the next slasher but I like a believable exploration of how the characters get there so it certainly doesn’t have to be detailed. But because Chris has had to completely reassess his identity and ability to have sex with a man, I wouldn’t mind some insight into what he’s feeling when he does take the leap. If you don’t want to write them getting together that’s cool, but it'd be awesome if Chris and Edgar’s friendship could be a main focus. Whatever you choose to write will be awesome as long as you have fun writing it.

Forever Knight 
Tracy Vetter, Nicholas Knight (Forever Knight), Don Schanke, Lucien LaCroix

Hello, thank you for writing for me - you absolutely don't have to write all the characters I've nominated, and feel free to include anyone else you like :)

Prompts below are optional, if you have another fic you are keen to write go for it - I like all the characters and prefer character driven stories that focus on relationships rather than straight case fics.
- AU where Tracy survived! Nick mans up instead of making her forget. How does that conversation go? How does it affect their partnership?
- Schanke figures Nick's secret out AGAIN, or finds the photo again and remembers and this time Nick respects him enough to NOT make him forget.
- Schanke returns – IIRC his body was never found? Maybe the trauma has made him remember, or Nick in helping him deal with his trauma, inadvertently (or advertently) reveals his truth, or maybe Schanke survived because he’d just been turned?
- Either Lacroix refuses to kill Nick and makes him deal with his manpain (not even AU because that’s totally what would have happened if the series had been renewed) or slight AU where Nick doesn’t give up and decide to die. 

But if none of these ideas appeal to you, Nick and Tracy being awesome together, or Nick and Schanke being awesome together, or Lacroix/Janette/Nick relationship stuff (I OT3 them) are all things I love.

Am fine with any of the nominated characters making appearances but I'm not big on Prince Sidon as a Prominent character.

And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side - James Tiptree Jr. 

This is one of my favorite short stories, because it packs a massive punch in very few words, and is quite literally about one of my favorite subjects: humans wanting to fuck aliens. It’s a pretty brutal skewering of scifi machismo and critical of period-typical racism (there is one use of a racial slur by an unsympathetic character). What I want here is worldbuilding/exploration, which is why I didn’t nominate any characters. 

Here’s my favorite excerpt: “We’ve hit the supernormal stimulus. Man is exogamous—all our history is one long drive to find and impregnate the stranger. Or get impregnated by him; it works for women, too. Anything different-colored, different nose, ass, anything, man has to fuck it or die trying. That’s a drive, y’know, it’s built in. Because it works fine as long as the stranger is human. For millions of years that kept the genes circulating. But now we’ve met aliens we can’t screw, and we’re about to die trying. . . .” 

It’s such a deeply colonialist statement, and like all Tiptree’s best work, it’s possible to take it uncritically. Yeah, humanity wants to go out and fuck things and we’ve found the unfuckable and now we’re all gonna die, fuckless. But actually, it’s such a good swipe at hypermasculine scifi. There’s also a criticism of the fear of miscegenation and immigration, presenting it as fruitless and perverted. Another theme that comes up is homophobia, as the engineer fearfully recalls that it didn’t matter that the Yyeir was male. 

I’d love to read a deconstruction of this, exploring what Tiptree started - perhaps the perspective of one of the aliens on humans? You could follow the newsman as he gets to meet aliens for himself. Or what if the story was set in 2017? (Please no references to the current political horror story, though) You could also write a story exploring the direct setting: alien sex addiction. What really would happen if humanity became obsessed with fucking aliens and no longer wanted to reproduce itself? How would the world end? You could also reset the story in a number of historical settings, which would be fascinating. Aliens and Genghis Khan? Aliens and Anglo-Saxons? Aliens arrive at Cusco before the conquistadors? 

I’m also totally down with Original Female Alien/Original Female Human or Original Male Alien/Original Male Human. What sort of cultural and sexual difficulties do they have? Do they end up having to tragically part ways, or are they able to stay together?

Deeply Strange Deep Sea Animals (Anthropomorfic) 

Is there anything more horrifying than the frigid depths of the ocean? You're living in total darkness under crushing pressure, without even the sweet release of early death.  

I want any and all fic about these critters. I'm particularly curious as to their inner thoughts. What's it like for the Greenland shark as the copepod starts to take hold in its eyes and slowly eats them? Is the shark distressed? Does it wonder when the eating will stop? Does it miss its eyesight, or does it even notice that it's lost a sense? And how does the copepod feel? Does it wish it had a more exciting host (does it know there are more exciting hosts?) or does it have a sincere love for the shark? Do Greenland sharks, when they reach sexual maturity at age 150, experience love? 

Does a hagfish have dreams above its station - like, does it ever think it would like to try fresh whale over decaying whale, but is sad that it’s not strong enough to swim to the upper layers of the ocean, and also it’s blind and full of snot? Perhaps you could write the POV of the decaying whale, and how it loves the community it feeds. 

Maybe there really were three giant isopods eating Doritos on someone’s floor. How did the isopods get there? Maybe Giant Isopods have their own advanced society under the ocean and we just haven’t found it yet. Perhaps a Giant Isopod decides to explore the surface, and becomes a celebrity. 

Or for another angle, who was the first person who ate Greenland shark and got wasted on sharkmeat? Were they then obsessed with the mystery of how to make the shark more edible? Consider: Greenland sharkmaids. Greenland shark selkies. I’m actually completely serious that I would love an F/F romance involving a Greenland sharkmaid and a scientist. Or maybe a romance between an male Icelandic bartender and a male Greenland shark selkie, after the bartender accidentally makes hakarl out of the shark selkie’s discarded skin and now he’s got a houseguest with an extremely low metabolism, bad eyesight, and memories of the 18th century. You could also reverse the gender setups of either these scenarios, as long as there is no M/F.

Fallen London | Echo Bazaar 
The Silk-Clad Expert

I love the setting of Fallen London so much. Normally, I’m very ‘eh’ about Victoriana and the assorted tropes, but the Neath has its Hellish, fungal charms. I’m most fond of the Brass Embassy, the devils (particularly the Quiet Deviless), the urchins, and the Tomb-Colonists. Also, any of the material that overlaps with Sunless Sea is great. For Fallen London, I prefer F/F but also like gen scenarios. This fandom is excellent for body horror, cannibalism, death being omnipresent yet impermanent, and also very very large, yet morose, spiders. 

While the Silk-Clad Expert didn’t have anywhere near the amount of content I wanted (a passionate romance with potential spider transformation, to be exact), what we got was completely charming. I loved how the Expert would play with your sorrow-spider, imitating the spiders eight-legged movements with her meager two arms. Her honey dreams of becoming a spider, and her fascination with how to become as spider-council. How did the Expert get to be the way she was? Is she a normal woman obsessed with spiders? Or is she a spider, forced into a human body and trying to return? A character study and origin story for her would be great. 

I would love it if instead of leaving after her quest sequence was done, the Expert pursues a romance with a female PC, or enlists the PC as her friend to help her in her search for more knowledge of spider-councils. Perhaps the Expert and the PC go to Zee, or explore the frozen North or go to Venderbight in the quest for knowledge. Maybe the Expert tries to make her lover/friend into a spider (like herself - perhaps the Expert was a spider-council all along), or she tries to transform herself into a spider. Maybe, after learning enough, the Expert decides that humanity is enough. Obviously, I cannot get enough body horror for this pairing, and weird sex would be a bonus to anything. You can get reaaaaally spidery with it. Suddenly eight eyes? Spinnerets? Venomous fangs? Some blood-drinking? You could also just write regular human sex; I’m game. 

The Expert and the PC could also get into all manner of other mysteries in the Neath - exploring whatever storylines you find interesting or pulling from the various scenarios I’ve put in my general likes. Fusions/crossovers with Sunless Sea are welcome. There's also the option of pairing the Expert with various female NPCs!

Gentleman Bastard Sequence - Scott Lynch 
Jean Tannen, Locke Lamora

I don't normally read fantasy books thick enough that they could be used as a doorstop, because I never love the characters enough. That was absolutely not the case as I read all 3 of these books in short succession. I love the confidence games the Bastards run, where the purpose is to defraud the hell out of the rich. Jean and Locke have a wonderful dynamic that keeps getting more and more codependent as the books go on. I'm pretty sure that Scott Lynch has a hurt/comfort and service kink going on, based on how books 2 and 3 both start with Jean taking care of Locke while he's mostly helpless and being pathetic. I ship them intensely, but it’d be easy to make any of my ship prompts gen and I’d still be happy. 

Locke is both incredibly capable and incredibly good at fucking things up, which I love. I'm obsessed with the trope of 'villain gets amnesia and turns good,' which Republic of Thieves delivered to me in yet another moment where I felt like Scott Lynch was out to get me right in all my narrative kinks. Locke being haunted by the past he can't remember (potentially having flashbacks to how he was 'born,’ or his old life) would be a great setup for angst between him and Jean. Jean is such a great character, particularly since he combines a lot of kindness, caring, and literary nerdiness with a bad temper and having the build of the Stereotypical Bruiser. The books really explore his loyalty to Locke, though they never quite fully explain why Jean’s life has to revolve around him, so digging into why he’s so loyal would be fascinating. Perhaps it has something to do with Locke’s secret evil undead wizardry, and Locke is bewitching Jean without realizing it?

I love Camorr, so I'd be happy to read fic set while the Bastards were there. I'm really fond of the Sanzas, sharks, and toxic honor culture.There's also so much about Tel Verrar and the time spent gaming the Sinspire that'd be worth exploring. If you're also into Jean/Locke, I'm super interested in canon divergence where they got together while the Sanzas and Bug were still alive, or if something made the ship happen during the second book. I'm not interested in fic set when Jean and Locke were teens.

Pretend relationship turning to real relationship would work well with a con, and is a trope I love. Locke and Jean getting trapped in a small space while hiding out from something and then boners happen. Locke and Jean go to Emberlain and it’s terribly snowy and Locke gets hypothermia and jean takes care of him and then they have sex. Maybe Locke gets creatively poisoned again, and he thinks he's dying and deals with his feelings by having sex with Jean, but then it turns out Locke wasn't dying after all. So many possibilities! You also don’t have to write getting-together fic - I’d be happy with established relationship where they go on some sort of adventure or just have some good sex. I’d prefer that if you write anal sex, Locke bottoms, but I’m not super attached to the idea. 

I would also deeply appreciate fic where Locke has to crossdress for a job, which results in Jean coming to terms with the fact that he wants to fuck his friend, and Locke realizes that he loves wearing dresses/skirts and also wants to fuck his friend. You could also go for a light-hearted roleplay element in it, like Locke is practicing his role for the con as ‘sexy forgetful maid’ and Jean is the ‘serious-minded tough’ and they end up taking it further than expected (to sex). Crossdressing or no, any sort of roleplaying (or practice roleplaying) for a scheme that ends up in sex would be great.

Note: I would totally dig any sort of crossover or fusion of the Gentlemen Bastards with the Dishonored or Fallen London universes, provided that the focus is on Jean and Locke rather than the characters from the other verses.

Le città invisibili | Invisible Cities - Italo Calvino 

I love Calvino's poetic and incisive language as much as I love the cities he imagined.  You could invent an original city (or a cycle of cities!) in Calvino's tone -- subtle, melancholy, allusive, ethereal.  Or if one of Calvino's cities sparks your imagination, you could write a story that could happen there.  I don't even care which city; the city that is exciting to you is exciting to me!  Or if you've got another idea, go for it!, as long as the city feels like a main character in the story.

XCOM Series (2012 reboot) 

I feel like Firebrand probably has an amazing untold story from the early days of the alien occupation, and I would love to read that story.  But I'd also love to hear about your squad's adventures -- original characters are more than welcome here.  XCOM is amazing for the stories that emerge out of gameplay, which sit somewhere between your campaign's \"canon\" and your imagination.  Any XCOM story with a solid emotional core (something more than just military valor) is a story I would love to read.

Kino no Tabi | Kino's Journey (2003 Anime) 
Kino (Kino no Tabi (Anime))

Kino's Journey ended much too soon.  I want to read a lost episode about another country she visits.  As with Invisible Cities, what I like about Kino's Journey is the presentation as much as the exploration -- that almost hypnotic tone, somehow simultaneously understated and unmistakable, that delivers on the promise of \"the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.\"  But it's important that we explore Kino at the same time that we explore the world.

The Exorcist (TV) 
Marcus Keane, Tomas Ortega

Yes, I love horror movies, and there are few things as wonderful as a really well made devil/demon movie/show/comic/etc.  The only problem is that so few are well made.  So one of my television delights has been the new series <i>The Exorcist</i>.  For this fic, I’m all about the Tomas/Marcus.  That ship has ALL THE THINGS that really ring my bells: temptation, seduction, forbidden acts, wickedness, penance/atonement.  I’d be interested in the forces of attraction and repulsion, surrender and resistance. I'm fine with non-con/dubcon.  I love to see two strong characters struggling to have the upper hand physically, intellectually, and sexually over each other, and if that also involves wrestling with their own inner demons, so much the better.

Critical Role (Web Series) RPF 
Matthew Mercer (Critical Role RPF), Liam O'Brien (Critical Role RPF)

I’m a long-time DnD gamergirl, and this show makes me wish I had a regular party and campaign going on right now.  For Yuletide, I’d adore a Matt/Liam fic, possibly one that has some bleedover from the game (characters, events, power dynamics, etc) into the relationship outside.  It could carry those things forward, invert them.  I’m flexible.  I like scenarios where tension and rivalry between their characters bleeds over into an encounter between the actors and where there are some blurred lines between the actors and the roles they are playing. I love to see strong men/women struggling to have the upper hand physically, intellectually, and sexually over each other. I’m good with dubcon and kink, more than good.  However, neither is strictly necessary.  While it’s fine to acknowledge/mention Marisha in the fic, I’d prefer she play a small role if you must have her at all.

First let me just say that, like many folks, I have ALL THE LOVE for this movie.  It made me feel happy and whole and strong, and just really fucking glad, they made a female superhero right.  One thing that I loved about this movie is that the man was the love interest, the sidekick character.  He’s the one who has to sacrifice for Diana’s arc to continue.  I also liked how Diana could own her sexuality in the same powerful way she owns her fighting abilities and physical prowess.  I’d be interested in seeing what happens in the room when the camera's fade to black.  Or I’m fine with a dream sequence set in the present day about what Diana might have done/how she would have seen thing differently if she knew what she does now.  I love to see two strong characters struggling between surrender and resistance and have a special love for pegging, but if that’s not your thing it’s not a requirement.

And yeah, I’d love to see more Grayson/Midnighter fic out there in the world.  You could set something within the comic run, or I’d be just as happy with something after and before the Rebirth series kick in.  For this one, I’d love character-driven explicit rated slash.  I’m fine with hard dubcon (or softer varieties) or none at all if that’s not your thing.

Midnight Texas (TV) 
Bobo Winthrop (Midnight Texas), Olivia Charity (Midnight Texas TV), Lemuel Bridger (Midnight Texas), Fiji Cavanaugh (Midnight Texas TV)

The only thing that made me unhappy about this delightful summer series is how short its season was.  I enjoyed the hell out of the storytelling, the small arc of the murdered girls and how it fed into the larger one of the Veil tearing open, and I loved that the narrative was so strongly character driven.  Favorite characters are probably Lem, Fiji, Joe, and Olivia, though Manfred and Bobo definitely grew on me throughout the season.  I’m really open for a lot with this fandom: show me Bobo and Fiji’s first time in a little more detail than the show could and really get inside their heads to show what’s happening there.  Give me some hot Olivia/Lem that’s spiced with danger and wickedness.  I’m more than up for some Fiji/Olivia (if you’re so inclined).  While I know it’s a bit out of scope for my sign up, I wouldn’t mind Joe/Chuy or Lem/Manfred.  As always, I’m interested in the forces of attraction and repulsion, surrender and resistance. I love to see two strong characters struggling to have the upper hand physically, intellectually, and sexually over each other, and if that also involves wrestling with their own inner demons, so much the better.

God, this book. I would appreciate something to fill at least a tiny bit of the gaping hole in my chest that this book left behind, but I don't think a fix-it fic is even remotely possible with this book. For obvious reasons. *sobs* So I would love something like a \"deleted scene\", like what were things like for Tristan and Will on the very few tolerable days they had. I know it'll still be sad as all hell but that's okay. If you want, you could also write smut. I'd love that too, and I imagine it'd be less emotionally crushing to write (maybe).

The Bright Sessions (Podcast) 
Joan Bright, Mark Bryant, Samantha Barnes

I love pretty much all character interactions and relationships on this show, they're all very interesting for different reasons. I'm especially interested in all angles of the relationships between Joan, Mark, and Sam: Joan and Mark's complicated sibling relationship, where she feels guilty and would do anything for him and he doesn't know what to do with his anger, Mark and Sam's slowly developing relationship, Joan and Sam's slightly awkward friendship. I would love to see Mark and Sam go on time-travel dates (and Sam getting opportunities to share her powers in general, maybe by having Chloe paint what she sees in her head or telling Adam all he wants to know about her travels), more of Mark's recovery process and reconciliation with Joanie, or Joan and Sam becoming closer friends who find things they like doing together. I also like Chloe, Caleb, and Adam a lot. Imo it's also an excellent fandom for h/c fic, for example  AM-related ( Wadsworth is an excellent villain and Joan's relationship with her has a lot of potential) or otherwise.
This is the one fandom where I don't mind setting AUs: you could put them in a fantasy world or on spaceships if you want, just don't take away their powers.

Children of Time - Adrian Tchaikovsky 

The spiders are fascinating, and I would love more spider civilization worldbuilding. What other technological things do they do differently than we do, or do they have that we don't, and what about societal differences and how it changes, and what about their art? Etc. etc. You could tell me stories about spider libraries, or spider sports, or spider university – pretty much anything. Or how spider civilization changes after contact with the humans and they try to adapt so that they can live side by side.
I also loved how the worldbuilding was always combined with stories about characters we already kind-of knew and how they were always similar but at the same time different, especially the relationships between them. I liked all the Portias and Fabians and Biancas, and I loved how Portia and Fabian's relationships varied from betrayal to self-sacrifice. Feel free to use any of them that we already know and expand on their stories, or to come up with your own versions.
If you want to write about the humans, the time right after first contact and the first generation of the two species living together interests me the most. It would also be interesting to look at the different reactions of e.g. those who never woke up after they left Earth, Key Crew, and the Tribe.  Or if you want you could write futurefic, during or after \"Diaspora\": what happens when the Voyager reaches Earth?

I desperately want their reunion with Christian catching up with Braxton after the movie--either the initial meeting where Christian goes to find him, or Braxton slotting himself in Christian's life again and how they readjust to each other, or more meets up in the future. I also want backstory fic, sparring together and learning to work as a team as kids, or Braxton being violently defensive of Christian when they're children and teenagers. I want \"us against the world\" fic when they were younger, and then how that changes, shifts, falls apart as they get older. 

I ship them hard and if you wanna write me first time incest, backstory incest, post movie incest, I would LOVE that but it's not necessary--just give me messy, complicated brothers. 

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse (allusions, references and implied abuse is ok though), cross-gen incest, unrequested pairings, setting AUs, character death, underage incest below the age of 15. See my letter for more details.

Buzzfeed Unsolved (Web Series) 
Shane Madej, Ryan Bergara

This show is oddly my happy place, even though a lot of the content is horrifying. I would love case fic here, with Shane and Ryan tackling something new we haven't seen before. I ship them a lot and I would love to read some slow burn, falling in love spanning multiple cases they've done, and/or just focusing on the ins and outs of traveling all over for haunted places and former crime scenes, life behind the camera and in between filming.

I'm not generally into whole setting AUs (so don't write me something like a coffeeshop AU), but I think it'd be really fun if Shane secretly turned out to be some kind of magical creature (maybe he's a werewolf? A vampire? Something else entirely?) and Ryan finds out. Or you could go full horror story and have Shane and Ryan tangle with an actual ghost or demon that fucks with them, follows them home, or something genuinely horrifying. 

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse (allusions, references and implied abuse is ok though), unrequested pairings, setting AUs, infidelity (I know Ryan has a girlfriend, so for the sake of this request, maybe pretend she doesn't exist or they haven't met yet? I see the show as a heightened reality anyway, not quite acting but definitely putting on a type of performance/role). See my letter for more details.

Baby Driver (2017) 
Buddy | Jason van Horn, Darling | Monica, Debora (Baby Driver), Bats | Leon Jefferson III

I love all these requested characters!!! All of them!!! I absolutely do not need all of them in the same fic and will be open to almost all combinations of these four. If you somehow wanna write a foursome between these four, be my guest!

1. Buddy/Darling backstory! Or an AU where Buddy/Darling live to Bonnie/Clyde another day!

2. Bats backstory! Where the fuck did he come from??? What is with that speech he gives before a job? I love it and I love him, he's so dramatic and trigger happy but also a lot smarter than anyone gives him credit for. I would love to read more about him, his pov, and I'm totally open to Buddy/Darling/Bats, whether it's threesomes before a job for good luck or antagonistic rough sex.

3. AU where Debora, not Baby, is the tititual \"Baby Driver.\" I would love Darling/Debora or Buddy/Darling/Debora for this.

See my letter for more details and prompts!

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse (allusions, references and implied abuse is ok though), unrequested pairings, setting AUs, infidelity (When it comes to other Buddy and/or Darling ships, I would prefer an open relationship for them, poly, or threesomes/moresomes/etc, rather than breaking them up or cheating fic. Please do not break up Buddy/Darling).

From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series 
Seth Gecko (FDTD TV), Richard Gecko (FDTD TV), Santanico Pandemonium (FDTD TV), Scott Fuller (FDTD TV)

I love all of these characters! I would love any combination of them, gen or shippy! I'd love post s3 fic where some time or years down the line, the Geckos meet up with Kisa again, maybe to help her with new queenly duties, maybe they accidentally run into each other, or maybe they just miss her. I OT3 Seth/Richie/Kisa a lot, so I'd love to see it go in that direction, but I also love any time the Geckos and Kisa interact, especially after they all worked together to save the world. 

Or write me fic about Scott Fuller post s2--where does he go? How does he end up forming a band? Did he turn all of his bandmates? I find Fanglorious delightful creepy and awesome at the same time and I totally want to read more about a vigilante Christian vampire rock band!

Or post s2 fic focusing on Santanico/Kisa herself! I'd love something that focuses with her identity struggles, going from being called Santanico and declaring Kisa \"lost\" to reclaiming her name, and starting her fight club. 

See my letter for more details and prompts!

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse (allusions, references and implied abuse is ok though, given the canon--I would definitely love Kisa's trauma explored), unrequested pairings, setting AUs, sexual content below the age 15.

The Wolf Among Us 
Bigby Wolf (The Wolf Among Us), Faith (The Wolf Among Us), Nerissa (The Wolf Among Us)

I requested both Faith and Nerissa because generally, I'm not sure if Nerissa is really Nerissa at the end there (and was disguising herself as Faith in the opening), or Faith. I tend to fall along the lines that the \"Nerissa\" walking away at the end is actually \"Faith\" from the beginning in disguise, but I don't need you to stick to that interpretation for fic purposes--I also love the thought of Nerissa surviving and living as well. My main prompt is post canon fic--where does \"Nerissa\" go from there? I want to see her surviving and thriving. 

I ship both Bigby/Nerissa and Bigby/Faith--I love the long suffering PI with a soft spot for a dame in distress vibes he had with both of them. I would love something where he does manage to catch up to Nerissa at the end, or runs into her in the future, especially if you go with \"Faith in disguise\" interpretation. I would love fic about Nerissa and Faith working at Georgie's club as well--either the build up to their plan to escape together, or how they coped with the forced prostitution together, or something shippy between them. Feel free to throw in Lily as well!

(I also love Bigby/Snow a lot but for this exchange, I don't want my fic to center around that ship beyond some unspoken pining in the background)

See my letter for more details!

DNW: Noncon, dubcon, animal cruelty, graphic depictions of abuse (allusions, references and implied abuse is ok though, given the canon), unrequested pairings, setting AUs.

<strong>General Likes:</strong> I like deep characterization and backstory, family, deep platonic bonds, worldbuilding, chosen family, digging into a character’s mental/emotional space, asexual romance, romance, established relationships, developing trust, character studies, identity exploration, character competence, fluff, angst, and situational humor. I also  love dance, sword-wielding, tea, cats, music, geeking out on technology and science or language (I adore language and words!) whenever appropriate (and sometimes when it's not).

<strong>General DNWs:</strong> Please no graphic violence or gore, graphic description of open wounds or sickness-related yuck. I’m fine with knowing they’re happening, just g-rated descriptions please. Also please no betrayal/infidelity (except where canonical), tragedy/deathfic (mentions of canonical deaths fine), horror, character or ideology bashing, smut without any buildup or characterization first, on-screen uncensored profanity, embarrassment, body-related humor. I have no problem with assassination but do have a problem with murder. I know. Fine line.

<strong>Style/Structure Likes:</strong> Any length from drabble to epic. I like poetry, N+1 fics, mixed media, interactive fiction, traditional narrative, footnotes, and multi-language fics with translations, including binary or canon-specific stuff. I’m open to every person and tense.

<strong>Style/Structure DNWs:</strong> Please don’t make readerfic, scripts, teleplays, podfics, or audio-dependent formats. Audio on the side like a fanmix is fine.

<strong>Trope Likes:</strong> I like superhumans, living weapons, competence, soulmates, soulmarks (not names), soulbonds, secret relationship, sharing a bed, domestic fic, holiday fic, arranged marriage, fake marriage, friends to lovers, rivals to lovers, AIs, accidental relationships, time travel with consequences, fantasy AUs, missing sense especially deafness or blindness, animal transformations/shapeshifter, brainwashing, amnesia.

I don’t mind coffee shop AU, school AU, reincarnation, historical AU.

<strong>Trope DNWs:</strong> Please no alternate gender norms, vampires, mind control, zombie, supernatural, daemons, post-apocalyptic, instalove.

I’ll read but am not a fan of pain play, oral, cock rings/cages, or dirty talk  (like: where one partner is telling the other what to do or one partner talking the other through sex like <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/901156\">in this fic</a> or <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/3882001\">this fic</a>, don’t like: stock porn phrases, e.g. “I’m so wet for you”, “I want your big cock inside me”, etc. or lavish descriptions of body parts and clothes).

<strong>Art Likes:</strong> I love so many styles: line art, pen and ink, pencil drawings, colored pencils, paint, watercolor, digital art, etc. My favorite things in art tend to be the awe-inspiring realistic with vibrant colors and sharp or soft edges, line art / ink / pencil theme pieces that pick up visual symbols of the characters, and cute stylized fluff pieces with romance or humor in mind. I also adore illustrative art that captures a scene or moment of fic or canon. I would absolutely love landscapes or still lifes of any of the scenery or environments or architecture, etc. of any of my fantasy canons.

Gauntlet Dark Legacy 
Sumner (Gauntlet Dark Legacy), Garm (Gauntlet Dark Legacy)

So Sumner and Garm, then...
Good wizard, bad wizard. 

How about the build up to summoning Skorne? Maybe Sumner wasn't as innocent as he pretended to the Heroes he sent into the 8 lands? 
There is no backstory whatsoever about these two Wizards, and I'd love a little  prequel to what happens in the game. Appearances by the game heroes are optional, but would also be fun. Maybe Sumner isn't as clueless about what Garm was up to as he pretends to the Heroes.
Or alternatively, Sumner hangs around in his tower for the whole game. Plus he seems to have an infinite supply of power ups and needs to acquire shed loads of gold. Why?
What about a fic where their positions are reversed?
Would Garm be cross that it took Sumner so long to \"rescue\" him, and took his revenge by turning evil?
And one thing I always enjoy about the game, when you click on quit game, it takes you to a short scene, where Skorne's arm punches through the wayy and nabs Sumner. I have always thought that was a very good way to end a game!

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Goosefat Bill (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

My favourite film.  I love the energy, the anachronisms, the Britishness, and the whole bundle of fun that the film is.
I am in the process of writing a long fic about Bill and Arthur, and I love the attitudes of the two men towards each other.
Something In-Movie would be fab. Maybe the scene in the brothel when Art hands Bill over to the Blacklegs, from Bill's pov. After all, Arthur handed him over without a second thought. Or when Art runs off and throws the Sword away, and Bill et al go and find him. Bill's not very active at that point, but just hangs around at the back.
Or a longer bit at the Round Table at the end, with Sir Bedivere and Percy and Wet Stick.
Or maybe after they have escaped Londinium, does Arthur shout at him for shooting Mercia?

Not even sure how you can write a fic about that album, but there are so many excellent songs, and the whole thing works together so well. Sledgehammer is still one of my favourite songs, even after 20 years.
I would like a fic that tries to capture the atmosphere of this album, although it can be quite melancholy, I think it has a strong element of hope to it (\"Don't give up, you still have friends\"), so atmospheric, but upbeat, if you can.

Call Me By Your Name RPF 
Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name RPF), Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name RPF)

First, here is a short and general list of likes/dislikes (likes do not need to be included, just so you can get an idea of what i tend to go for)--
Likes: angst with happy/hopeful endings, age difference, affection and touching, body language, pining, slow/lazy sex
Dislikes: mpreg, abo, noncon, incest, any real trope-heavy sex (ie. Ds, daddy kink, painplay, etc -- i prefer sexual intimacy to be more... organic? or not fitting into a 'category') 

I am open to really anything between these two, be it platonic love or romantic/sexual love, or just LOVE in general. Affection and softness and no sad ending would be so so lovely! With that though, I do love me some angst, especially longing/pining. I would also request for there not to be jealousy with regards to Armie's wife. You can exclude her entirely from the fic if you like, but if she is mentioned I would rather it be without anger or resentment pretty please. Uncertainty or trepidation or ... even confusion is fine, I just don't want her to be the antagonist of the fic, if that makes sense, I just want it to be about Armie and Timmy. I am totally fine with there being graphic sexual content or none at all, I will leave that up to your writing preference. Thank you thank you!

Call Me by Your Name - André Aciman 
Elio (Call Me by Your Name), Oliver (Call Me by Your Name)

First, here is a short and general list of likes/dislikes (likes do not need to be included, just so you can get an idea of what i tend to go for)--
Likes: angst with happy/hopeful endings, age difference, affection and touching, body language, pining, slow/lazy sex
Dislikes: mpreg, abo, noncon, incest, any real trope-heavy sex (ie. Ds, daddy kink, painplay, etc -- i prefer sexual intimacy to be more... organic? or not fitting into a 'category') 

I would love to see some sort of a happy ending for them, though I know it would be difficult. Elio talks of taking a specific path at a 'fork in the road', or just taking a wrong turn and leading the wrong life. Perhaps a parallel universe where a different path is taken would be nice. This could even be done as some sort of soulmates au, where multiple paths are shown, with different outcomes, with at least one showing them together again. I would also love love love to see Oliver a bit more torn up over losing(or potentially losing) Elio because I am awful and love angst lol. I guess it doesn't necessarily need to be an all-smiles, flowery happy ending, but just something more hopeful! They deserve it!! I am totally fine with there being graphic sexual content or none at all, I will leave that up to your writing preference. Thank you so much :)

Captive Prince - C. S. Pacat 
Laurent (Captive Prince), Damen (Captive Prince), Nicaise (Captive Prince)

First, here is a short and general list of likes/dislikes (likes do not need to be included, just so you can get an idea of what i tend to go for)--
Likes: angst with happy/hopeful endings, age difference, affection and touching, body language, pining, slow/lazy sex
Dislikes: mpreg, abo, noncon, incest, any real trope-heavy sex (ie. Ds, daddy kink, painplay, etc -- i prefer sexual intimacy to be more... organic? or not fitting into a 'category') 

I would love an au with Nicaise alive, within the setting/time period of the novels. It doesn't necessarily matter how you do it -- be it his death just never happens, or is faked, or however else -- but just that he comes to them post-series and is given the support and love that he didn't have as a child, I suppose. Maybe he sees Laurent and Damen's love and learns from it? I would love for this to be focused more prominently on Damen and Nicaise, if possible. Perhaps Nic learning to trust him, or being fondly disgusted by how soppy he is over Laurent, or just... anything really. I loved Nicaise and Damen's interactions, few as they were, and would love to see that given a chance to develop a little bit more! I would rather there not be any sexual interaction between anyone and Nicaise, but I am fine with sexual content between Damen and Laurent. Thank you so very much!

הסודות | The Secrets (2007) 
Naomi (Hasodot)

I'm interested in exploring any of Naomi's relationships with other characters, particularly the central love triangle. I think the ending is so fascinating, how Michelle and Yanki's relationship is predicated on Yanki understanding that Michelle's feelings for Naomi aren't going away, but that they don't have anything do with her feelings for him. Something of Anouk's past returning to trouble Naomi and Michelle again would also be interesting. But what I would most like to see continued exploration of Naomi's relationship to the sacred texts of Judaism. Naomi going deeper into Kabbalah, going deeper into Shas, constructing a life centered around text. Naomi as a Rabbi, or Maharat, or Yoetzet Halacha, or Talmud professor, or serving scripture and the Jewish people in some other capacity. Naomi exploring Sufism or Zen Buddhism or other religious mystical traditions, from a position grounded in her knowledge of Kabbalah.

I find the romance at the end of this story a little frustratingly abrupt, but if you could show their arc afterward I might be convinced, so I'd like to see what married life looks like for Michal. More than the romance, I love the female friendships in this story, and any look at any of those friendships would be great. Also, Michal and Yoss continuing as friends after she gets married would be interesting to me, they have such a sharp chemistry.

Over the Garden Wall (Cartoon) 
Beatrice (Over the Garden Wall), Sara (Over the Garden Wall), The Beast (Over the Garden Wall), Wirt (Over the Garden Wall)

Thank you so much for writing for me!

First, something that goes for all my requests: I don't have any triggers or dealbreaking squicks (though I'd prefer you to avoid explicit underage), and I'd welcome fic of any tone, form or genre - rating or weirdness no object! If my suggestions spark something, that's great, but I'd much rather you write the fic you want to write, whether or not it has anything at all to do with my prompts. Please, feel free and have fun.

    --

I love how uncanny and kind and lavishly autumnal this show is, how it functions as a glorious, melancholy remix/reprise of just about the entire American cartooning tradition (not to mention Miyazaki and Tove Jansson and Sylvain Chomet and Dante and probably a zillion other references) while remaining very much its own beast (Beast?). I love how truly all ages it is, how it manages to be wryly acute about the tribulations of both childhood and adolescence - not to mention genuinely creepy- without shutting out younger viewers. I love how it deals with death and disguising: how it gets down to the bones of Halloween. I love the characters, from Wirt's teenage catastrophizing to Greg's secret guilt and matter-of-fact oddness. And I love how the series is grounded in the real world, in an ordinary American Halloween, without ever quite tipping The Unknown into 'it was all just a dream' territory.

I really enjoyed just about everything the show gave us wrt Beatrice, from giving the Dantesque guide character a redemptive story-arc of her very own, through having her spend most of the show as an adorable bluebird, right down to making her a constant source of high-quality snark and exquisitely passive-aggressive put-downs. I'd be interested to see her taking a trip to the land of the living - does she gatecrash another age-appropriate drinking session in the cemetery, or get trapped in our world of oddly untalkative animals and have to find her way back into the Unknown (with the help of Wirt and Greg, and/or a finally-unmasked Sara)? If you want to locate The Unknown as definitively the world of the dead, does that mean Beatrice is aware of her post-life status? Doe she remember what it was like over on the other side?

We don't get a great deal of Sara, but I was really charmed by what we did see, from her kickass skeleton costume to her willingness to hang out in graveyards drinking age-appropriate drinks. I'd love to see her interacting with The Unknown in any capacity - an AU where she accompanies Greg and Wirt from the start? A solo journey, where she gets to know Beatrice on her own account, or discovers that there's a place for her ballet (or wrestling) skills in The Unknown? A post-canon fic where she gets curious about Wirt's odd remarks and his brother's unusually musical frog? Another bait-and-switch, where it turns out she was in on the secret all along? After all, there is that skeleton costume, and we never quite see her face: to some extent she really is, well, Unknown.

And, well, I found Wirt painfully easy to identify with, as an erstwhile self-serious adolescent with a much younger sibling. I would absolutely love seeing how he dealt with the aftermath of their trip to The Unknown, whether you wanted to go with an immediate follow-up or something set at some point in the (distant?) future. I can see a great story in a fic which follows a grown-up Wirt (plus Greg, and perhaps Sara?) back into The Unknown - could they find their way back, this time around? What does The Unknown look like through adult eyes? 

Or, for that matter, through the Beast's eyes, however many of them there actually are? The Beast is such a wonderful, genuinely terrifying anagonist - I'd love a flat-out horror fic, or an origin story. Or what about a fic in which The Unknown - or the Beast - begins to infiltrate the everyday world? Less terrifyingly ... just what does happen to Greg's friend the frog? (No, seriously, if you want to write an entirely frog-centric fic following his adventures in our world, I would be delighted).

 Really, I just love the show as a whole and would love to see more of its world and its people, from the horrifying (the edelwood trees!) to the wonderful and weird. If you'd like to play around with interactive fiction, for instance, this seems like a good place for it (all those branching paths in that dark wood...). Or a ghost story, perhaps (starring Beatrice?). Something which slips in and out of pastiche would be entirely true to canon - I'm absolutely open to crossovers and/or intertextual references (not that I can promise to catch them all, of course!).

In the Flesh (TV) 
Kieren Walker, Simon Monroe

I loved this sweet, sad, sharp little show: how generously metaphorical its central conceit was, how suggestive its mythology and worldbuilding, how fiercely hopeful it remained for all that it was full of horror and petty cruelty and the corrosiveness of fear. I've nominated Kieron and Simon, but I'd be delighted with fic that focused on expanding the post-Rising world, or on answering some of the questions the end of season 2 left open: what is to become of Amy? Of Jem? Of Maxine? One of my very favourite aspects of the show was its sense of place: how rooted it was in the landscape and community of Roarton; how much attention it paid to the dangerous (in this case, almost literally apocalyptic) dynamics of local gossip and old-new prejudices. Fic which worked along these lines (minutes from meetings of the Roarton Historical Society before, during, and after the Rising?), or which expanded on the nightmarish bureaucracy faced by 'PDS sufferers' (to chilling and/or comedic effect) would be amazing.

(Incidentally, intrigued though I am by the implications of Amy's canon fate - and much as I refuse to buy that her second death was intended to be final - I'm not all that interested in seeing the undead returned wholesale to life, or at least not with this being presented as an uncomplicated happy ending.)

I should admit, as well, that In The Flesh was crammed full with tropes I absolutely love. 'Monsters' trying desperately to pass for human; characters haunted and threatened by the loss of their very identity (and identity-porn in general); the everyday mechanics of uncanny bodies; body-horror and unethical human experimentation galore ... if your fic leans into the curve on any of these aspects, I would be delighted.

I'd also be delighted with flat-out shipfic: how do Kieran and Simon negotiate their romance, after the end of season 2? How do they manage sex, if they do so at all? (I'd be more than fine with sweet/unsettling/hilarious zombie porn adventures!). How does Kieran cope with being the subject of some of the same messianic zeal that Simon once applied to the cause of the Undead Liberation Army - with having become, perhaps, Simon's new Cause? How does Simon deal with Kieran's tendency to second-guess himself, to sink into apathy or despair? How do they both manage to sustain a relationship across possible centuries of unlife? (And, ngl, I'd prefer it if they did.) What does the world look like, five centuries after The Rising? After Amy's (assumed) second resurrection? When Roarton itself is gone, and all its living inhabitants distant memories? There's a lot of room here for epic scope and aching bittersweetness (or flat-out darkfic: absolutely welcome), but I'm also very fond of the dopey, earnest awkwardness of Simon and Kieran's early courtship: I'd love just another supper with Kieran's family, or perhaps a meeting with an older Jem, post-canon. Or, well, just a day in the unlife. Village fêtes optional!

Archer's Goon - Diana Wynne Jones 
Awful Sykes, Erskine (Archer's Goon), Venturus (Archer's Goon)

Archer's Goon is right up there among my very, very favourite Wynne Jones books, and to be honest I'd love just about anything which expanded or deepened the world of the novel, whether or not it focused on my nominated characters. After all, part of what makes the book so compelling is that so much is left to the imagination, even after Howard/Venturus has managed to unpick most of his identities: the narrative is full of characters emerging from nowhere and indeed zooming off into it, in a spaceship no less. And yet, of course, we can infer quite a lot about these various nowheres - and the hints we get are disquieting, to say the least. Anything that built on this - following along on that spaceship, for instance - would be amazing.

That being said, I <i>would</i> very much like to see, for instance, what happens when Awful and Howard/Venturus grow up. There's a suggestion in the book that Awful might have inherited more than a touch of the family's power (perhaps all that proximity to Venturus brought it out in her) - is this in fact the case? If so, does she really grow up into a second Shine? Just how much chaos does she wreak, or refrain from wreaking?  (And just how much does Howard/Venturus cause, trying to be A Responsible Brother for once?). Not to mention, what does happen once Erskine returns from travelling the world? Do he and a grown-up Awful really hit it off? Does he come back, as Howard fears he might, with a rekindled taste for a spot of light world-ruling? Come to that, does Howard manage to restrain his own worst impulses, this time around? I'd love answers to any of these questions, or something more low-key and slice of life: one of the things I love most about the novel is the way it refracts fucked-up family dynamics through the strictures of petty local beaurocracy, and in doing so illuminates the intricacies, horrors, and even the hidden strengths of both - not to mention painting a pretty compelling picture of small-town British life, rain and knotty history and grotty polytechnic all included. Basically, if you want to confront your cosmically-powered characters with something akin to the road-mending extravaganza of the first chapters, I would be <i>there for it</i>. Perhaps Archer and co manage to turn their spaceship around and exact their revenge by trapping the rest of the family within the town boundaries once more? (Speaking of that spaceship, I would honestly also love a fic which took it upon itself to rescue Fifi, who I always felt got a truly raw deal. Perhaps <i>she</i> comes back and exacts her revenge, somehow or other (through the power of petty beaurocracy?)).

Basically, I enjoy just about everything about this book, especially how brilliantly it paints a portrait both of a place, and of two overlapping families. I even love how downright cruel the story sometimes is (that spaceship! Fifi!), and how uncertain it seems that Venturus' family will ever be able to build a place for themselves on earth, at least without transforming it entirely. There's lots of space for darkfic here, and I'd be fascinated to see it. But I also love the warmth which the novel fights its way towards - the realisation that the bonds between some of the siblings can be salvaged and celebrated; the vision of family life which Howard/Venturus literally turns back time to have some chance at securing. I'd love to see more of Quentin and Catriona, as welll as Torquil and Hathaway - I can see rich potential, for example, for some exquisitely awkward - if potentially heartwarming - family dinners. Anything which played off this element - the power of family, be it lost, found, saved from the (municipal) scrapheap, or quarantined in the depths of outer space - would be amazing. Feel free, by the way, to nudge the setting towards the present-day or to keep it a period piece (that polytechnic! Fifi's legwarmers!). Or, indeed, to play around with time itself - its not as if there isn't canon precedent! And, well, if you just wanted to provide a series of extracts from Quentin's various two-thousand-word tax 'payments', I definitely wouldn't say no (perhaps with annotations courtesy of Awful and/or Howard?). Really, go small, go big - go spaceship or city hall - it's not as if the novel doesn't give you room for either extreme, and I'd love just about anything which gave me more of its world.

The Last Kingdom (TV) 
Aelswith (The Last Kingdom), Hild (The Last Kingdom), Aethelflaed (The Last Kingdom), Mildrith (The Last Kingdom)

Aelswith: how did she become Alfred's counselor as well as consort? What is her relationship with her daughter Aethelflaed like? (TV canon, not book canon, please.) Loved her scene with Hild in s1; did they interact later, too, say, during Uthred's year as a slave?
Hild: how does she reconcile (or not) being a warrior with being a nun? Both her transition to primary warrior and then back to primary nun would be worth exploring. Did she ever meet Mildrith in her later life? Her take on Aethelflaed?
Aethelflaed: what did she learn from her parents about being a ruler? How much does she see herself responsible for Wessex and Mercia? Interaction with Hild (sole female Christian warrior of her acquaintance) would be lovely. What does she make of the Danes (other than Erik)? In short, exploring Aethelflaed and NOT focusing on her relationship with Erik would be great.
Mildrith: her pov on s1 events, as well as the before and after. What was it like for her when Wessex got invaded, she lost her baby son and Uthred was already gone? Did she find what she wanted when becoming a nun? Her relationship with the Oddas, father and son?

Borgia: Faith and Fear 
Alessandro Farnese | Pope Paul III (Borgia: Faith and Fear), Giulia Farnese (Borgia: Faith and Fear), Francesc Gacet (Borgia: Faith and Fear), Rodrigo Borgia (Borgia: Faith and Fear)

Alessandro and Giulia Farnese: the other important sibling relationship of this show. Alessandro navigating between survival and being a (mostly) decent man for a Renaissance cleric, Giulia - who is easily the more ruthless and devious of the two, but also passionately loyal to those she loves - eventually deciding making Alessandro Pope would be her end game, both their affection for each other surviving its ups and downs - anything exploring them would be great. 

Francesc Gacet and Rodrigo Borgia: ditto. Their shared background in Spain: how did that boyhood friendship between a (former and future) gay Muslim and an ambitious boy destined for the clergy develop? When did they decide on their head/heart combination Rodrigo references in s3? When did making Rodrigo Pope become end game? What was it like for Francesc to see Rodrigo live out his sexuality while having to be celibate or risk a gruesome death himself? Was either of his conversions (from Islam to Christianity as a boy, from Christianity back to Islam in s3) a matter of faith to him, or of survival? Coming back to Rome as Turkish ambassador: to get revenge on Rodrigo or to look after him or both?

Logan (2017 Movie) 
Charles Xavier (Logan 2017), Logan (Logan 2017), Caliban (Logan 2017), Laura Kinney (Logan 2017)

Logan, Charles and Caliban in the immediate aftermath of what had gone down at Westchester: how did Caliban join them, anyway? (Especially knowing that as opposed to Logan he wouldn't survive if it happened again.) Between age, the ravages of his illness, getting drugged up (again, and this time not by a co-dependent Hank at his own request), and intermittent awareness of what was going on, how does Charles cope with being bundled across the country and ending up in Mexico in a tank? Is Logan at any point tempted to leave Charles? How does he see Charles anyway, having known him now for decades (plus a time trip where he encountered young and anything but wise Charles), meaning the pedestal is gone? Charles is physically older but Logan is mentally, does that even matter anymore at this point? What are they to each other?

I adored their road trip with Laura; this is one fandom where I wouldn't mind an AU where all three (or four, if you find a way for Caliban to join) keep travelling so that their developing relationships with Laura and Laura's pov can be explored as well.

Class (TV 2016) 
Andra'ath | Andrea Quill, April MacLean, Tanya Adeola

Andra'ath/Miss Quill: what was it like for her, going from being forcibly bonded to the future ruler of her enemies, to seeing both their people wiped out? (Just how much time passed between the defeat of the Quill and thus her getting enslaved via symbiont and the annihilation of both Quill and Rodians by the Shadow Kin?) What were those first few months on Earth pre-pilot of the show like? Her jibes at April in the pilot come across as crueller than her general snark to me; why does Quill have it in for April in particular at this point? Once April has (temporarily) defeated the Shadowkin and become their ruler, it practically begs for a scene with Quill and her which never happened, so give me that. Quill's feud against the Shadowkin, after all, is at this point in the show still her main raison d'etre. Lastly, Tanya being the first to point out that what the Rodians did to Quill is slavery, and Tanya and Quill bonding in the season finale was great, but what happens next? Especially given Tanya has just become an orphan at age 14, doubts her only friends really like her and has to explain what the hell happened to their mother to her brothers. Martial arts lessons by Quill are undoubtedly good for rage venting (and helpful the next time villains come calling), but she needs a bit more parenting/mentoring than that, while Quill hails from a culture where offspring eat their parents. How does their relationship develop further?

General loves and hard DNWs are in my letter.

I really want to know what happened in those seven years between Michael arriving on the ship and the mutiny. The relationship between Michael and Captain Georgiou fascinates me--it's such a beautiful friendship and even at the end, Michael did what she did to save her captain. I'd love to see that relationship explored and find out how the went from Michael's rigid Vulcan-influenced mindset to the emotionally mature, funny woman we meet at the beginning of The Vulcan Hello. The power dynamic makes me wary of a story where they're lovers, but if you want see Michael's feeling as unrequited love, I wouldn't say no :-D Possible prompts to play with:

- Michael's first away mission with Georgiou and the ways it all goes horribly wrong.
- Michael's first on the ship, starting to realise the changes she's facing, and Georgiou helping her through it like the wise woman she is.
- A Star Trek classic - the shuttle crashes and Michael and Georgiou must bond and work together to get back to the ship! Bonus points for sciencing the shit out of their problems.

The only thing missing from the movie was around fifty hours of Diana and Etta having adventures together and becoming the amazing friends I know they can be. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write one of those stories. A post-movie story about Diana and Etta kicking ass, hanging out together, and the way their differing talents complement each other would delight me.

Call the Midwife 
Delia Busby, Patsy Mount

General loves and hard DNWs are in my letter.

I know Delia and Patsy aren't going to be in the next season and they got their happy ending, but it was so quick! No lingering details! So what I want is the story about where Delia and Patsy go next, what they do, and how they build their life together. (If this looks a lot like my prompt from femslashex, it is. But no matter what I get in that challenge, I am always happy to read more fic about my faves.)

Strike (TV 2017) 
Robin Ellacott (Strike (TV 2017))

I wasn't sure about the changes they made to The Silkworm, but I was delighted they still gave Robin her moment of being the most amazing driver ever. I didn't expect to end up loving Robin so much, but I do. She's the best.

I'd love a story where Robin gets to be amazing again. Something where another skill she's acquired is vital to a case (bonus points if Strike actually notices and is proud of her) or where she's a champion at something new she's learned in her quest to be an investigator. Maybe she has secret ninja skills (unlikely, but I'd go with it) or her unfinished psychology degree gives her an insight into a suspect that cracks a case. A story where Robin gets a moment of triumphant awesome is what I need.

Kerbal Space Program 

What I'd like is some kind of story that evokes the Kerbal way of spaceflight.  With explosions, of course.  Whilst character-death is probably a likelihood, I'd prefer it if Bill, Jeb, and Bob survive (they die often enough when I'm playing the game!).  This could be anything from an Apollo-11 style \"first Kerbal on the Mun\" story, to an Apollo-13 homage, to pure and simple slapstick humour in space.

Chronicles of the Kencyrath - P. C. Hodgell 
Jamethiel \"Jame\" Priest's-bane, Timmon of Ardeth, Brier Iron-thorn

Jame, central character as she is, is partly an interesting character because while she does have a conscience and ethics they don't align with either those of the world around her or of the reader.  Timmon and Brier both stretch and test those ethics; in different ways.  I would be happy with a story involving Jame and Timmon or Jame and Brier; but I think the most interesting would be a story in which Jame is caught in the tension betwen Timmon and Brier's worldviews.

After is fairly simple, the text leaves it in no uncertain terms that Ligeia is unhappy with Tzenni's choices, and that she's unlikely to let things lie.

Alliance-Union - C. J. Cherryh 
Sam Whitely

I was going to start this off by saying that Sam Whitely is in some ways the token \"normal\" person in Reseune, but I got barely halfway through that sentence before deciding that he isn't.  It's only because we're seeing him in a context full of Political Psych that he doesn't look like a genius.  He almost certainly doesn't think he is.  But he's the only one who can make Ari II relax, his architectural skills are sufficiently respectable that he managed to persuade people other than Ari to let him build Alpha Wing, and he appears to have an absolute eye for design.

  Whilst he's a minor character I think we see quite a bit of his personality and skills.  He's in many ways another outsider in Ari's coterie, and in the Reseune Lab environment.  What I'd like is something that either puts a spotlight on Sam, or that uses Sam to be a spotlight on the rest of the books.

  Sam has a canonical pairing, but there's lots of room for before, after, as-well, affairs, or many other kinds of things, if you want.

Falcon - Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson 
Falcon (Falcon), Agidy Yelov (Falcon)

I've always been fascinated by Yelov and the complicated relationship Falcon has with him - once chief and subordinate, now renegade and enforcer. I'd love to see any story where they cross paths, whether they're working together, or hunting each other, or having a doomed torrid affair. I also like the interactions between Falcon and the other Special Agents, so I'd be interested in anything from dramatic joint missions to the office Christmas party. I'm not that fussed about continuity, given it's a gamebook series, and I like alternate universes too. (Incidentally, in my head, I think of Falcon as male, but gender ambiguity is also cool!)

There are six books in this series. However, I would be perfectly happy with a story based only on the first book.

The Book of Isle Series - Nancy Springer 
Dair (The Book of Isle), Frain (The Book of Isle)

Destined soulbonds! Loyalty! Magic! Shapeshifting! I love that Dair is a wolf learning how to be a man, and that Frain is a healer who cannot heal his own wounds. I love that Dair feels immediate instinctive loyalty, and that Frain only gradually grows to care for him deeply. I ship them, but am equally happy to read about their friendship. I'd love to see missing scenes during their time in the palace of the king or during their perilous quest, or new adventures after the events of canon. I would prefer that any sex scenes only involve characters in human form, not animal form.

Dair and Frain appear in The Golden Swan, the fifth and final book in a loosely connected series called The Book of Isle. It refers to earlier events, but can be read as a standalone. It's been many years since I read the other books, so my memory is pretty hazy. You're welcome to reference them or not, as you like.

Chronicles of Amber - Roger Zelazny 
Martin (Chronicles of Amber), Random (Chronicles of Amber)

I love Martin for the adversity he's overcome, and Random for the growth he's undergone. And I'm still amazed that they go from having a bad history and no relationship, to the tentative beginnings of a father and son bond. I've always wondered, what was their first meeting actually like? It must have been emotionally charged, but we're never told the details. And then everything changes again when Random is crowned king, which no one expected. How does this affect their relationship? Is Martin now in the line of succession? We see them playing music together and having awkward conversation in the palace library. What other hobbies might they share, or try to share? Do they ever need to join forces to solve a political or magical problem? What might bring them closer together or test their bond?

I prefer the main focus to be interactions with canon characters, rather than with original characters or historical figures. My favourite of the books is probably Sign of the Unicorn, for all the familial scheming and snark.

The First Chronicles of Amber are five books that focus on Corwin, and the Second Chronicles of Amber are another five that focus on his son Merlin. Some fans only like the first series, but I like both.

As I've done for many years now, I've requested The Laundry Files and specifically an Angleton story. The Files have moved on, and I still enjoy the series, but what can I say - I love Angleton, and I miss his presence in the books. Basically, I like characters with a monstrous side to them, and I have a thing for snarky, domineering, slightly scary, just this side of villain, mentor types. I was especially saddened by the events of The Rhesus Chart, so I'd like to see a story focused on him, with a romance if you could possibly imagine one. Please note that Bob doesn't have to be in the story, although he's a great narrator, (and I wouldn't mind if you paired them) - I think it would be shocking enough for Bob to imagine Angleton having any kind of personal life whatsoever!

Some other non-romance ideas that I'd enjoy are Bob accompanying his boss on an actual field mission (!), discovering a story from Angleton's past, or catching a glimpse of him on vacation. (I've written a Laundry crossover myself in the past.)

I'm also curious about how Iselle responds to this new stage in her mother's life, or in general how she and Ista navigate their relationship now that both their circumstances have changed so dramatically (or perhaps, given Ista's debilitation for most of Iselle's youth, they never had much of a relationship at all, and have to build one new).

This is probably one of my oldest OTPs, and I would love to see them figuring out their relationship in the aftermath of The Blue Sword. McKinley gives us lots of \"here's what happened after\" fairly quickly, so I'd be interested in seeing them figure out how things work day-to-day, as well as actually being romantic with each other. What's it like suddenly becoming queen? What's it like suddenly having a queen? They come from very different backgrounds; how do they adjust to that when there's not an immediate crisis at hand? And let's face it, they are both crap at talking about their feelings, so they probably run into difficulties with that somewhere along the line. But basically anything that explores how their romance might develop would make me happy.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) 
The Mage (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword), Arthur (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword)

Uh, so bless whoever nominated every character under the sun for this pairing.  Doing god's work.  

Anyway, apparently I was only one of like 5 people who actually loved this movie.  Mostly for the dynamic between these two dummies.  For more on that, go here: http://sevensneakyfoxes.tumblr.com/post/163880848529/there-are-kinda-but-not-really-spoilers-in-this

Sweet god.  First off: her TAKENOSHIT attitude about his little smug butt at first, the fact that she's a warrior badass in her own right.  Second: it's when she's threatened that he's able to use the sword for the first time.  COINCIDENCE?  I THINK NOT.  One of my favourite things about this movie is how Arthur doesn't even question the Mage's role within their group and develops a lot of trust and respect for her quickly.

In fact, Arthur's general respect of women - and desire to protect them - was basically the reason why I fucking loved this movie right off the bat.  There's no judgement on how women in the brothel raised money, and his rage at these women being mistreated and seeking justice for them was fantastic.  PLEASE CONTINUE THAT THREAD IN THE FIC.  Arthur respecting women regardless of their position in society?  YES PLEASE.

I'd love something that follows after the movie, exploring a possible future between the two.  In the same way Arthur struggles to find a place in the world and does not want to be a king, I can see the idea of the Mage struggling to find her place after her duty to Merlin is fulfilled.  And boy, would she EVER not want to be a queen.

WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS IDEA SO FUN: IT IS MY ABSOLUTE BELIEF THAT THE MAGE'S NAME IS GUINEVERE.  $20 says that in the sequel they had planned that will never be given this was a bomb at the box office, that little tidbit would have been dropped.

So there's that.

Please feel free to disregard his canonical death.  ENTIRELY.  I'd love something where he lives and settles down close to the Cullen property.  And their begrudging friendship developing into something decidedly more than that.  Given how broken Emma was over the murder of her husband, I see this as being something angsty, but cut by Faraday's self-deprecating humour.

It is little secret that I ADORED Chris/Jenny when they were together in real life, and their grossly adorable chemistry bled into the movie, so here we are, with me requesting a fic for yet another Chris Evans movie of dubious quality.

Whatever.  I still loved it.  YES, I LOVE CONTRIVED STUFF WITH CHILD GENIUSES AND ONE-EYED CATS.  Judge me.

I'd love something set after the movie where Frank pines a bit over his STUPID MOVE with Bonnie.  Groveling would be lovely, even though Bonnie would not be the type to require it.

THERE WAS AN AMAZING DELETED SCENE.  It's set after the scene on his boat after he loses Mary and he's a TOTAL DICK to Bonnie, intentionally a bit cruel, including telling her, \"Just once I wish I could meet a girl who could take a hint.\"

So you know what?  Yeah, make him grovel a bit.  After that shit, I can't imagine she'd be keen to get back into his bed.  (She admits in the scene that he would have been a shit boyfriend.)  BUT THAT'S WHERE I WANT THINGS TO HEAD. 

THINGS THAT I LOVED AND WANTED MORE EXPLORATION OF: Frank's past as a professor.  His past in general.  You definitely are left with the sense that while he wasn't a bad person before he began raising his niece, he was a wee bit of a selfish dick.

Scott & Bailey 
Gill Murray, Julie Dodson

I love Scott &amp; Bailey because they have so many different and awesome women in all kinds of interesting relationships with each other. Gil und Dodson are obviously friends, and I would love to read more about that. Maybe the first time they met, or a quiet moment on a case together, or a situation where they team up against sexism in some way, or anything else you choose. I do not care whether it is pre-canon, a missing scene, or post-canon, but no slash, please. I am interested in different kinds of friendship without romantic entanglements, and I think there is a lot of potential here.

There are hints of their relationship before Janine's marriage in Privilege, and I would like to know more. Kids, teens, it doesn't matter. What I am interested in is a kind of „us against the world“ mentality, and their disregard for the rules and regulations of society, each in their own way. Maybe they get away with something because people can't believe they did it, or push each other to try ridiculous and forbidden things, or stand up to/manipulate an adult together, or keep each other's secrets, or anything else you choose. I am not squicked by incest, but I would like it if you could keep it gen.

A Woman's Face (1941)

I think Anna is the most interesting character in the movie, and I like to know more about her. Maybe something gen and pre-canon, about how she became an unashamed criminal, or one of her successful schemes, or a missing scene from the movie, or anything else you choose. I do not like the ending; I think it is out of character for her to marry Segert. Mostly, I pretend that the last five minutes do not exist. As you can see, I do not like Segert, and I hate his wife. Thorsten is OK, and if you want to make it het instead of gen, go for it.

Stellaris (Video Game) 

I’ve spent too many hours playing Stellaris this year. I have a bad habit of designing races that are plausible and coherent rather than especially likely to do well! Story of a space explorer finding life for the first time? Diary of a governor fed up of the unreasonable demands? What that guy from the Fallen Empire stuck behind an impenetrable shield did while he was there? I can think of so many things that I’d love to read – go wild!

More than anything, I’d like a story from the perspective of one of the species that has been uplifted by humanity. I don’t care if it is positive or negative, I don’t care if it’s canonical or the results of clandestine experiments. I can’t entirely explain what I love about these books, but the way that the dolphins have Trinary as a bridge between how a dolphin that has not been uplifted thinks and the structured logic of Anglic captures it perfectly.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
Link (LoZ: Breath of the Wild), Prince Sidon

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
This game is so beautiful! I love flying and cooking and taming horses and playing dress-up with Link. Who is brave and adorable, and of course I want both wonderful and terrible things to happen to him. I'm cool with him either speaking or not in the fic!

I also love Sidon a lot! He's so enthusiastic and cheerful, and has no doubt that Link will survive the scores of awful enemies awaiting down that road over there :D I like a fluffier dynamic for them than I usually am into -- possibly because the whole interspecies size difference thing makes it work that much better. That being said, I'd love emphasis on differences between their cultures and experiences -- both in terms of species and era.

Night Sun Tarot Deck 
Knight of Wands (Night Sun Tarot), Three of Pentacles (Night Sun Tarot), Three of Swords (Night Sun Tarot), Page of Swords (Night Sun Tarot)

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
I love this deck's intensity and intricacy, and I'm all about the dark-fantasy atmosphere. I’ve linked to the images of my requested cards in my letter.

The precise scope of canon is up to you. You can base fic solely on the images of my requested cards; you can use the imagery in the entire deck + the hierarchical structure of tarot for worldbuilding; you can use the traditional meanings of various cards to develop characterization.

<b>Knight of Wands:</b> Adventurer, channeled instinct, departure, breaking, postponement.
<b>Three of Pentacles:</b> Expansion, success, perseverance, immaturity, incapacity.
<b>Three of Swords:</b> New ideas, departure, regrets, loss, distancing.
<b>Page of Swords:</b> Perseverance, observation, prudence, hesitation, unforeseen events.

<b>DNW:</b> Animal harm/death; Crossovers/fusions; Extreme underage (14+ is fine); First or second person POV; Infidelity, requested ships breaking up; Main/requested character death, graphic gore, permanent maiming/incapacitation; Pregnancy, requested characters as parents; Scat, watersports, emetophilia, rimming, sounding; Setting-change AUs, role-reversal AUs, age swap AUs, gender identity AUs

王室教師ハイネ | Oushitsu Kyoushi Haine | The Royal Tutor (Anime) 
Licht von Granzreich, Leonhard von Granzreich, Eins von Granzreich, Ernst Rosenberg

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
Leonhard and Licht are my faves. I love Leonhard's enthusiasm and naivete, as well as his tsundere attitude. Licht's flirty playboy attitude is kind of hilarious, but I also really enjoy him making real connections with people.

I've only watched the anime, so I don't know if Eins gets more development in the manga -- but in the anime, he's a very mysterious figure, defined more by his absence than presence. And then he shows up very briefly, but he's tall and hot and clearly has plans in motion that he doesn't need Rosenberg's interference for (basically calls him to heel, lol) -- so I'm sold :D

With this set of characters, I'm hoping for something a bit darker, perhaps exploring some of the political machinations either canon-era or post-canon. I'm also down for badwrong shipfic, or fluffier incest with Licht and Leo.

<b>DNW:</b> Animal harm/death; Crossovers/fusions; Extreme underage (14+ is fine); First or second person POV; Infidelity, requested ships breaking up; Main/requested character death, graphic gore, permanent maiming/incapacitation; Pregnancy, requested characters as parents; Scat, watersports, emetophilia, rimming, sounding; Setting-change AUs, role-reversal AUs, age swap AUs, gender identity AUs

Shadowscapes Tarot 
The Emperor (Shadowscapes), Knight of Wands (Shadowscapes), Nine of Swords (Shadowscapes), Seven of Swords (Shadowscapes)

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
This deck is a gorgeous fairy tale dreamworld. Feel free to draw the boundaries of the canon wherever suits your muse! You can spin completely from the individual requested cards; worldbuild off the deck as a whole; delve into traditional meanings and readings for characterization. I'm very interested in the characters as fae/fair folk/etc rather than humans.

<b>The Emperor:</b> Creating order out of chaos, authority, leadership, strength, establishing law and order.
<b>Knight of Wands:</b> Change and progression toward a goal. He is an individual full of daring and passion.
<b>Nine of Swords:</b> Inner turmoil. It is a moment of vulnerability, with the soul laid bare to its own demons.
<b>Seven of Swords:</b> An attempt to escape responsibility. It is the thief who tries to make away with what is not his.

<b>DNW:</b> Animal harm/death; Crossovers/fusions; Extreme underage (14+ is fine); First or second person POV; Infidelity, requested ships breaking up; Main/requested character death, graphic gore, permanent maiming/incapacitation; Pregnancy, requested characters as parents; Scat, watersports, emetophilia, rimming, sounding; Setting-change AUs, role-reversal AUs, age swap AUs, gender identity AUs

Togainu no Chi (Visual Novel) 
Rin (Togainu no Chi VN), Shiki (Togainu no Chi VN)

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
Everyone in Togainu no Chi is driven by their obsessions; Shiki’s obsessed with killing Nano, and Rin’s obsessed with killing Shiki. I’m interested in exploring how the brothers relate to each other in conflicting and reflecting ways.

If they were somehow forced to work together after the game, I think they could perhaps find an uneasy ceasefire. They share a lot of experiences and they’re both frighteningly competent; they can see the value in each other’s skills even if they want each other dead. And I do ship them, on a sliding scale from badwrong to worsewrong.

Karneval (Anime & Manga) 
Gareki (Karneval), Hirato (Karneval)

<b>Please see my letter for prompts, general preferences, and tropes I like!</b>
This canon is such fluffy id candy! All adorable animals and frothy circus costumes and cuddly friendships and human experimentation and slavery and child soldiers -- what more can you ask for, really.

Hirato/Gareki is my favorite Karneval pairing, and I just really want more fic for their dynamic, whether or not it's shipfic! I'm such a sucker for Gareki's angry woobie backstory, and I'm 100% here for the reluctant mentorship thing he's got going on with Hirato. Hirato teasing and flustering him is excellent -- as is the more serious, gradual trust-building. I like Hirato's initial interest in Gareki growing as he sees his potential, and Gareki grumpily (and without necessarily realizing it) learning that maybe this is a place he can belong and a cause he can fight for beyond himself. Trust issues and rough adjustment periods and communication issues are all A+.&nbsp;

Baseball RPF 
Anthony Rendon, Trea Turner

I love the Nationals, I love Nationals baseball, and I love baseball in general. Trea and Tony have been The Friendship that the Nationals have been trying to promote this year and whoaaaaa has it delivered. I have more gifs/links for them than for other canons just because it took a bit more doing to compile them.

- Have a disgustingly comprehensive tumblr post about their friendship, including matching T-shirts, headbutts, celebratory Gatorade baths, and more. http://dontsleepsharks.tumblr.com/post/165197121619/anthony-rendon-and-trea-turner-are-bffs
- Have a video of Trea as the ‘Anthony Rendon’ translator. (As the interviewer notes, this is the first time that they’ve done an interview with an ‘interpreter’ of someone who is perfectly fluent in English.) https://www.mlb.com/video/rendon-turner-join-mlb-central/c-1351579183?tid=7417714
- Trea chanting ‘It’s Mr. WAR himself’ while throwing beer/champagne on Tony: https://twitter.com/Nationals/status/907010653604466695
- Have a gifset of what happens when Trea hits a homerun. (Hint: It’s headbutts and more T-shirt flashing.) http://gfbaseball.tumblr.com/post/165697325102/trea-turner-hits-a-2-run-home-run-september-24 

Fic prompts:

- I love anything involving game play. So, if you want to set a game in space (!!!!), in a cyberpunk dystopia or in an AU version of baseball with sweet robot battles, time travel, etc. that all works.
- If you’d prefer a setting other than baseball, I definitely love plot, so if you want to have them solve a murder mystery (probably in an AU, lol), or being Austrian monks in the same abbey, or space clerics, etc. etc., that works well for me.
- I really am totally OK with gen. For real. I generally like close, bordering on claustrophobic friendships, but so long as they’re friends in the fic, I promise I’ll &lt;3 it. But if you’d like to do something shippier: If you want to have one of them as having been experienced with men and the other not, I’d prefer the former to be Tony and the latter to be Trea. If you want to work in any of the shirts (especially Trea’s tendency flash his), head-butting (with hair petting), or anything from above, that would be amazing. 

DNWs apply for all of the requests
DNWs: Really graphic, gruesome or sexualized violence; Nazis, Nazi-like movements/AUs, or genocide; incest; character death, violent, graphic non-con or any kind of underage; scat or watersports kinks; infidelity/relationship drama; or character bashing. Please don’t make the story Christmas-themed. I’m also a huge baseball fan - please don’t mention Jose Fernandez, who was killed in a boating accident last year in any way in fic. I’m a huge fan of his and would strongly prefer to keep his death out of fic. 

For Nats fic: Please lock anything shippy to Ao3 and please don't use either of their RL fiances as characters.

The Expanse Series - James S. A. Corey 
Amos Burton (Expanse books), Praxidike Meng (Expanse books)

So, I’ve both read the first two Expanse books and The Churn, and have seen the show. (I’m waiting on the third book until after the next season.)

I really like Amos and Prax’s relationship in both the show and in the books, particularly the later part of book 2. I would love any fic you wrote about them, but particularly if it were hurt/comfort set during the second book or anything AU about their lives after the second book, particularly surrounding Prax and the restoration of Ganymede. I don’t normally like kidfic, but I’m fine with Mei also featuring as a character, since she’s so central to their relationship. I’m also totally fine with the crew of the Roci showing up in the fic, or Bobbie or Avasarala. Basically, I love everyone in this space bar. Except Miller. (JK, I like Miller too.)

I also know Amos has a traumatic backstory - I’m totally fine with elements of that appearing in the fic, but would prefer not to have it on-screen. (So, alluding to his being a child sex worker is fine. Actually featuring it on-screen the fic is a hard no.)

Fic Prompts:

- Five Messages Amos Doesn’t Send Over an Open Comm Channel
- Prax oversees restoration of the Ganymede farms and also gets periodic visits from Amos
- The night before they rescue Mei
- Prax teaches Amos how to grow plants

I love the evolution of their friendship the trust that got built between them, and particularly the moment where all the weirdness about Gloria’s interactions with technology gets resolved into being a show of how isolated she feels. I also appreciate how Winnie’s confidence builds over the course of the season, and how they learn to trust each other as colleagues as well as rely on each other as friends. I know Winnie was trying to get pregnant on the show, but I would prefer no kidfic.

Fic prompts

- I would love to see them as buddy cops solving the next murder in Fargo. If you like writing mystery, please go wild.
- AU where they’re lady detectives in the 1920s a la Miss Fisher (or as a fusion with that ‘verse) or film noir-style detectives or a Sherlock Holmes ‘verse fusion (not crossover).
- I liked the in-canon resolution to Gloria not being able to work automatic doors, etc., but I would also be OK with ‘Gloria really was a ghost the whole time’ AU.
- This is a universe where aliens exist, so I’m not saying it was aliens, but am totally fine with this having a sci-fi twist to it.
- Shippy! Maybe they solve a case together and the real solution is … that they were in love the whole time. I love them as friends, but shippy fic would be awesome as well.

The Martian (2015) 
Rick Martinez (The Martian 2015), Mark Watney (The Martian 2015)

These two were my favorite parts of the movie (and book, which I’ve read, though I know this is a movie and not a book request). This has been in my REQUEST FOR YULETIDE to-do since … I think December 26 last year.

I really liked their written exchanges, and I would love any fic that uses or expands those. I would love to read post-movie/book fic in which Mark gets used to Earth again. It could be poly with Rick’s wife or the two of them together. I love the ensemble cast of the movie, but would prefer that Beck/Johanssen be a background pairing and/or not really heavily featured in the fic.

Fic prompts:

- This is a fandom where mixed media/epistolary/etc. styles work really well, so if you want this to be 5 Letters Mark Doesn’t Send Rick from Mars (or the reverse with 5 Letters Rick Doesn’t Send Mark), or communications before, during and after Mars, I would love to see that.
- Recovery post-Mars fic is A+++. I would really like to see Mark physically and psychologically adjusting to Earth again and what that looks like.
- I’m definitely open to AUs for this, like an AU where they’re Martians exploring the weird wet planet closer to the Sun or an Age of Sail fic with Mark stranded on an island. Heck, if you want to make Martinez stranded and Mark as his rover (kidding … but not kidding), that would be awesome.

The Expanse (TV) 
Bobbie Draper (The Expanse (TV)), Chrisjen Avasarala (The Expanse (TV))

Do not wants: explicit sexual content (anything up to M rating is fine), crossovers, AUs that place the characters in another setting.

I would prefer no non-canon pairings in this fandom.

I absolutely adore this show and especially these two characters. I love how fierce and uncompromising Avasarala is. I loved watching Bobbie struggle with her dedication to the Martian cause and everything she's learned since she met Avasarala, how she's had to adapt - so I would especially love anything that gets into Bobbie's mindset as she decides to defect and start helping Avasarala. And in general I also love the setting and the worldbuilding and all the political maneuvering that Avasarala gets up to.

I'm currently reading the books and I don't mind spoilers, so if you want to incorporate anything from the books, please feel free!

Prompts:

-Now that they're stuck together for awhile, I'd love to see a story about how they get along (or don't get along) - how do they learn to cooperate in the confines of a ship? How do they clash with each other? Where do they find common ground?

-I'd also love to see snapshots of one or both of their lives leading up to the first season - Avasarala when she was first starting out in her career, or spending time with her family, or Bobbie on Mars - growing up, learning about the terraforming project, becoming a marine, dreaming about seeing the ocean.

-Avasarala teaching Bobbie about Earth and Earth culture, maybe taking her to see things she would only ever have imagined - or Bobbie learning about what life is like for people who don't share the vision that she's had all her life.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 
Alabaster (Broken Earth), Damaya | Essun | Syenite, Innon (Broken Earth)

Do not wants: explicit sexual content (anything up to M rating is fine), crossovers, AUs that place the characters in another setting.

Ships (if you want to include any): Syenite/Innon/Alabaster

I think I love everything about this series. The worldbuilding, the characters, all the Earth imagery, the way the first book weaves together all these different parts of Essun's life and identity. I like how Essun/Syenite loves and hates Alabaster at the same time, and how Innon brought them a kind of stability and warmth that they couldn't have had on their own. I also love how Essun often experiences and perceives the world around her through her orogeny, and so I'd love anything that incorporates orogeny/magic and how all three of them would experience it in different ways.

Prompts:

-I would really love fic about their time on Meov together - navigating their relationship in the early days, learning to love each other in different ways, raising Corundum, being free insofar as it was possible for them.

-Or, I'd love to see some kind of canon-divergent AU where they aren't separated. Maybe Syenite never goes back to Allia, or when she does, no one tracks her back to Meov. Do they have that second child Alabaster wanted? How do Alabaster and Syenite change over the years? Or maybe they escape from Meov together and have to find their way through a world that is hostile to them (and unfamiliar to Innon).

-A story expanding on what happened during the years between Meov and where the first book picks up - Alabaster alone and grieving and slowly losing his mind without them, or Syenite settling into being Essun while trying to numb herself to the family she lost, especially in the first few years when it was still fresh for her.

The Shannara Chronicles (TV) 
Amberle Elessedil (Shannara TV), Eretria (Shannara TV)

Do not wants: explicit sexual content (anything up to M rating is fine), crossovers, AUs that place the characters in another setting.

Ships (if you want to include any): Amberle/Eretria, Amberle/Eretria/Wil

I read these books a long time ago, and so I was excited when I heard they were making a show about it. I adore the relationship between Amberle and Eretria; I'd love anything about their adventures and/or their relationship. I love how independent Eretria is, and I really love how she slowly came to trust and care about Amberle and Wil, to the point of being willing to die for them. And I love Amberle's resolve and determination to finish her quest no matter what, no matter the cost.

I also really love the post-post-apocalyptic setting and scenery of the show, and would love if you wanted to incorporate that into the story somehow. 

Prompts:

-Eretria finds a ~magical~ way to bring Amberle back after the end of season 1. They live together, or go on adventures together. I'd love to see anything that involves their worlds colliding - Eretria trying to fit in among Elven royalty, or Amberle learning to live like a Rover and give up some of her sense of duty for awhile.

-Missing scenes from their quest. Adventures they had, arguments they got into and resolved, a time when one of them got hurt and they had to rely on each other, learning to trust each other, talking about their pasts, moments of peace or lightheartedness, etc. 

-Anything bittersweet after they're separated. Eretria visiting the Ellcrys and remembering Amberle. Falling asleep and seeing her in dreams. Or Amberle as the Ellcrys, slowly forgetting Eretria over the long years of her life.

I've included only Gil and Ingold as character requirements, but please feel free to include any and all of the series' other characters as you see fit, with subplots featuring them as needed, as long as the main focus of the story is on Ingold and Gil.

Tawny Man Trilogy - Robin Hobb 
FitzChivalry Farseer, The Fool (Robin Hobb)

Gen or slash, it matters not to me, but give me more of that relationship between Fitz and the Fool that I adored.  You don't even have to \"fix the ending.\"  Perhaps you can do a story about a young Fitz when \"The Fool\" was merely that, at court or otherwise.  A missing scene during the books, a meeting after the trilogy's end, or even a completely A/U version of the books.  I mean this, whatever floats your boat here.  I'd just love to see more of them together, in whatever method you can come up with.

Battlestar Galactica (1978) 
Starbuck (BSG 1978), Apollo (BSG 1978)

I've listed only Apollo and Starbuck as characters, but feel free to include any one of the tag set characters, or even those not in the tag set if you so choose, as long as the main focus is on Apollo and Starbuck.  The sky's literally the limit with story choices here, as I truly have no preference.  Perhaps you could do a different adventure story set during the series, perhaps with the entire crew being awesome, or even a story set before the start of the series, canon or A/U.  

I'd rather not have a \"clueless Apollo and Starbuck bumbling around on modern day Earth\" type of story, but if you can do a serious story about what happens when the Galactica finally reaches Earth, that wouldn't go amiss either.  (I'm obviously ignoring Galactica 1980 here, as well I should.)  Also, Gen or slash, whatever you feel most comfortable with writing.

The Chronicles of Chrestomanci - Diana Wynne Jones 
Mordecai Roberts | Tacroy

Mordecai angst, please. Lots.

Mordecai growing up as a relatively normal kid and then realising that oh hey, my soul is not my own. Mordecai mentally rewriting his life in a way that lets him get through betraying everyone he actually likes every single day of it. Whatever the Dright did to him that means he doesn't even try to stand up any more. Repercussions from Christopher claiming him as his man. The Dright coming back, not because he's worth anything to them but on the principle that the Dright hates losing anything.

I would prefer no shipping please. I can like happy endings or non-happy endings.

A Brother's Price - Wen Spencer 
Jerin Whistler

This book does an awful lot of \"skirting horrible things happening to men\" and then rushing on to our main characters getting happy endings after all. So! AUs where Jerin didn't get to marry a princess and ended up needing to be married to Kij just for the money? Or him getting to marry them but he and Cullen discovering that even in happy marriages it's not that much of a dream? Or somehow getting to discover what his poor grandfather thought of the whole thing about being a prince and then being kidnapped and forcibly married?

Noncon/dubcon fine here as it fits with the theme.

I'm not looking for anything explicit here but beyond that this is my \"go wild\" prompt. Maybe they could meet Vandien's family (who assumed he was useless for being infertile)? I'm not even opposed to kid-fic so maybe they could discover he isn't infertile. Or just wandering, adventuring, being their lovely selves.

Not really looking for this to go explicit. Underage is fine though at least to mid-teens, because I can't see Laurel caring.

月刊少女野崎くん | Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 
Kashima Yuu (Gekkan), Sakura Chiyo

I know this is a longshot (and a rarepair), but YOU could write the second Kashima/Sakura fic on AO3 (there is only one right now, apparently)! Make Gekkan Shoujo Gay 2k17!

Prompts:
-The process of Sakura falling out of her first love, falling into her second?
-Fake dating, for whatever reason
-AU where Sakura meets Kashima instead of Nozaki at the entrance ceremony?
-Kashima investigates the Nozaki manga operation out of \"what's keeping my girlfriend so occupied\" nosiness?
-Kashima and Sakura go on a parfait date, which leads to a souffle date, which leads to a macaron date, which leads to...?
-AU where everyone works at a Buzzfeed-like viral video company, and fans start shipping their internet personas?

I love the silly comedy of the anime, hijinks, people being bad at words and emotions, AUs, and happy endings! Specifically about their dynamic, I like them because Kashima's kind of like the prince of Sakura's dreams, and Sakura's a girl Kashima feels comfortable with as a friend instead of a fangirl. I'm definitely interested in the various ways they present themselves to others, and how they might be more genuine with each other.

But yeah. Shenanigans!

ダンジョン飯 | Dungeon Meshi | Delicious in Dungeon 
Marcille (Dungeon Meshi), Laius Thorden, Farlyn Thorden, Chilchack (Dungeon Meshi)

(Note: I'm caught up to the current scanlations. The published volumes use slightly different character spelling, but I'm going with the scanlations since that seems to be what's represented on AO3)

I love this squad! I could only select 4 characters so I dumped Senshi for Farlyn but I like Senshi a lot too. Marcille is kind of my fave, and I ship Marcille and Farlyn, but I'm also just interested in inter-team dynamics in general.

Prompts:
-Someone else got eaten by the dragon instead of Farlyn. (Probably would have to be either Marcille or Laius to genuinely motivate rescue...)
-Modern AU: the squad meets up in a hostel in some random country with a lot of wilderness. Laius and Farlyn are there to eat crazy food. Marcille is doing research. Chilchack is a local guide (??). Senshi lives in the wilderness, living off the land.
-Modern AU: Alternatively, they all get stuck on an island (and Senshi was already living there) and have to survive long enough to be rescued.
-Indiana Jones/The Mummy AU
-Pre-series: Five times Laius's team noticed he was kind of a weirdo before he flat-out suggested they consume monsters
-Farlyn and Marcille at school together! We only see the beginning of their friendship in the manga, it would be great to get more snapshots (and maybe how Marcille gets looped into dungeon crawling, and meets Laius, Chilchack, &amp;c)
-Post-series: Marcille's attempts to create her own dungeon, and how her friends are completely unhelpful (except when they are)

Anything goes! I especially love the sense of humor the series has (with a somewhat grim core), and how everyone in the team is foolish in their own special weird way.

Please no: character death (farlyn ;__;), noncon

The K2 
Kim Je-Ha, Choi Yoo-Jin

I confess that I only watched the first 8 or so episodes of this drama (and vaguely know what happens through the ending), but I find both Ji Chang-Wook and Song Yoon-ah super compelling actors, and their characters in this drama are delightfully morally ambiguous and powerful in their own ways. I would love any explorations into the character's relationships, AU or otherwise, romantic or otherwise. (OK, romantic would be great)

Prompts:
-5 times Je-ha hated Yoo-jin, and 1 time he felt sorry for her (or... respected her)
-In general: the ways they respect each other as mutually morally ambiguous and powerful people
-Contrasting their relationships with each other vs their relationships with their SOs (for her: her husband, for him: Anna)
-Their weird, complicated feelings about Anna
-Yoo-jin survives. What then?
-Otherwise, my brain can only think of things like \"Yoo-jin was weirdly into that umbrella scene\" or \"Je-ha was weirdly into that 'having Yoo-jin at gunpoint' scene\" or \"Yoo-jin was weirdly into that 'her and Je-ha both covered in blood' scene\" so I guess the key phrase for this concept is \"weirdly into\"

Please no: noncon

Improvised Star Trek (Podcast) 

I LOVE THIS PODCAST SO MUCH and really I love all the characters, I kind of just...nominated these four as a starting point? But honestly you could write about anyone in this cast and I'd be delighted (honestly I adore the secondary characters, too, shout out to my boys Scooter and Pancakes Johnson).

I really do love seeing Lorem be a surprisingly good friend and then two seconds later being a huge creep and it's like yup those are apparently not contradictory. I love Crick's fucked up science abominations and flat demeanor and the running joke that everyone thinks he's a robot. (I kind of ship Lorem and Crick in a really really weird not at all romantic and also Crick is asexual so it's just a mess kind of way?) I love Zarlene so much it hurts because aren't we all afraid that we're the Zarlene in our own lives? Rayvek's time on the ship was so short I feel like it could be fun to see more of her doomed attempts to introduce a smidgen of competence and emotional intelligence to the Sisyphus.

This is one of those requests where I'm basically like, \"just give me more of canon, I love canon\". Like, show me a day in the life on the Sisyphus. Give me the oldest, corniest sci-fi trope that you know and then show the Sisyphus completely failing to handle it. Or take the oldest, corniest sitcom trope and dress it up in a Star Trek veneer, and then show the Sisyphus completely failing to handle it.

Janis Ian, Regina George

ENEMIES TO LOVERS, PLEASE. These girls are *so obsessed* with each other. And yeah they express that through horrible emotional damage, but I really want to see them overcome that and get to another level. Please give them some kind of scenario where they are forced to use their extraordinary powers of deception and sabotage to work together on something, only to realize that they actually make a great team and have a huge amount of respect for each other, to their mutual horror. Post-canon would be great, but also if you wanted to take this to an AU place that would be wonderful (I feel like they'd make a great feuding-band-AU).

If you don't want to take it to a shippy place I would also be happy to read \"enemies to reluctant allies who are friends deep down but would never admit it to anyone\" fic. But if you can make the smooching happen, then, yeah. Enemies to lovers.

Eleanor \"Nell\" Vance, Theodora (Haunting of Hill House)

GOD I just read this book for the first time and immediately fell in love with these two, even though I knew that it couldn't possibly end well for them. I couldn't help myself. The second they meet they're so thrilled with each other it's like they're the only people in the world. I love their morbid jokes and how each thinks the other is so lovely and wonderful, and just, *they're so gay*, my poor doomed gay babies.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here, I just want to read more with these two. I don't normally go for fix-it fics but if you wanted to do something to make this less horrible and tragic I'd be down. Alternatively, just, be spooky/haunting/tragic/fuck me up and make me cry, that's also good. I'm generally a fan of AUs but I think for this one I'd at least want something that retained the tone of the original setting/plot.

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 
Kimmy Schmidt, Xanthippe Voorhees

Is it terrible that I ship this? Possibly. Am I going to stop shipping it? Probably not. Do I understand if you don't ship it and want to write gen fic instead? Totally.

I do love ships/friendships where the characters are snarky and where insults are terms of endearment, but I also love that this is kind of a twist on that: Xan is that type to a T, but Kimmy isn't at all, but Kimmy also has the capacity to understand what Xan means when she's being rude and standoffish. And I think secretly Xan would come to love Kimmy's cheerful positivity and would really like getting called cute pet names? Also that Xan would get it when Kimmy just *can't* be cheerful and positive anymore, like, if Kimmy needs to rage about the bunker Xan would just be like \"cool let me show you where I go to break stuff\".

I like that season 3 let us see scenarios where Kimmy fit in better than Xan did, and how weird that was for Xan. I'd love to see more of Xan being pushed into roles other than \"poor little rich girl\" and how she copes with that. Maybe include some of her secret nerdy hobbies from season 1 like reading tween books and bird-watching? Maybe she coerces Kimmy into helping her drop out of Columbia and drive out to California and they bond along the way? I just really want to see them learn how to actually get along without having to be enemies again by the end of the episode.

Attack the Block (2011)

Generally I don't care for: death, pining that doesn't get resolved, polyamory, infidelity, bdsm, rape, torture and abuse, a/b/o, second person pov, mundane AUs, outside matchmaking.

I ship it. I feel bad for shipping it since he's 15, but I still ship it. I nearly clawed my face off when he gave her ring back, because in so many other movies that's right where there'd be a kiss. If you don't ship it that's fine though, because mostly I'm into them being weirdly codependent after everything that's happened and trying to pretend it's totally normal.

Obviously I had a (very normal) TON of feelings about Moses while watching this, the \"Everywhere you go, bad things happen. Stay away from us\" line K I L L E D me. Sure he mugs people but he wouldn't have mugged Sam if he knew she was from his estate, and the aliens aren't actually his fault!!

I'm a sucker for that thing where people who knew characters before the thing react to the way characters have changed after the thing (if this has a name, idk what it is). So what do Sam's coworkers think when she finally gets back to work? Do Moses's teachers notice a difference once he's out of jail? Does his uncle ever come back?

Or set it a few years down the line when it's a little less weird for one of them to make a move after years of dancing around each other! I'm game.

This show is the best anxiety hour every week. I love all the characters so much, but man, this season really made me a) become ride or die for Philip/Elizabeth and b) reflect on how far Oleg has come since he first showed up with his stupid hair cut and new age ties. And Stan would be the saddest sad sack on the show if not for Philip! I think it's amazing how they walk the line of him being good at his job even though his bestie is an Illegal.

These two pretty much hated each other but only began working together to try to save a woman they both cared for. And they failed, which has got to mess them both up a little, and they’re both the only person who they could maybe talk about that with. I LOVE the weird, grudging respect these have for each other and all the secret meetings in cars and alleys, and the way Stan was fighting to protect Oleg this season, and how Oleg must think Stan's just trying to wring more blood from the stone (but maybe he kind of misses hanging out with him anyway?) I do ship it, but in a way where I'm aware that it's probably just me and my friend in this boat.

I would love something that focused on the strangeness of their friendship, even if it just stays friendship, maybe something after the cold war ends and Oleg is back in the US? or they happen to meet up while abroad somewhere? How would Stan and Oleg's relationship be different after Stan finds out about Philip being the illegal he spent years tracking? (ALL HIS FRIENDS ARE RUSSIAN SPIES). 

Please feel free to incorporate any of the other characters in the tagset, I know and love them all.

I did not grow up reading these books, I read a couple about a decade ago because friends had written fic and I wanted to understand. But then these movies popped up on Netflix and I ADORE them. They're so charming and endearing and Callan Potter CAN GET IT. 

I fully watch those movies thinking Boots is very aware that he's totally in love with his best friend but Bruno has <i>no idea</i> and Boots just PINES. And I boy do I love pining. I'm definitely down for Hall based shenanigans, love Cathy and Diane (ship that, too!) and the guys, and the Fish and Ms Scrimmage (and The Fish/Ms Scrimmage). Someone gets bitten by a werewolf? Awesome. They find a dragon egg? Cool! Accidental telepathy/proximity bond/whatever: into it. Go nuts!

If cracky Hall stuff isn't your speed, I'd also love to see something set after their time at the Hall, in college where they're figuring themselves out at that level and having wider social circles etc. We know that Boots's parents aren't super high on Bruno, does that get better or worse when they start dating?

I've seen every episode of this show at least three times and I love every second of it and have shipped these two from basically the word go. This gifset (http://jamwingles.tumblr.com/post/164881185936) is a perfect encapsulation of what I love about this pairing. Eleanor is trying SO HARD to become a good person for Chidi but she's still...Eleanor. I still love the idea that they might actually be soul mates, for real, even if the Bad Place doesn't actually give a fuck about things like that.

I feel like a lot of bananas scenarios could be played with under the guise of Michael trying to fuck with them. Like some sort of (slightly fractured?) Fairy Tale AU world for the after life?? Or just a dozen iterations of their first meetings (I'd call them meet cute but I feel like they'd be meet-horribles at least half the time). I love their friendships with Tahani and Jason (and Janet!), too, so feel free to include them as desired.

I'm not particularly interested in AUs where they're still alive, unless you can really sell me on Eleanor getting motivated into being a decent human being while still on Earth.

A friend of mine recommended the 2007 movie to me and oh my god. Rupert Penry Jones pines SO BEAUTIFULLY. and I LOVE men pining, I love pining in close quarters, and abject misery steeped in STILL CARING. This was just catnip to me.

I'd love to see his point of view on the whole miserable situation, or what his friends are thinking as they watch it play out (the \"Miss ANNE Elliot??\" question delighted me). It mostly comes down to me wanting to wallow in their suffering, especially Wentworth's. The happy ending is GREAT, and I would not enjoy the suffering if the canon didn't end happily, but you can include that part (and go beyond) or not, as you so desire.

So my favorite thing this summer was they way all of my friends and I fell into this garbage pail of shipping this, only to discover that our cozy dumpster was in fact a full on landfill when it seemed like everyone in the world was disappointed when the rumors of them dating got shot down. 

Like, that Lip Sync Battle performance was Something Else. And then all the pictures and videos from their premiere tour (Tom wearing her clothes!), her being 9 feet taller than him in heels! that photoshoot where they were in a speak easy or something? IT WAS ALL INCREDIBLE.

I'd love an AU based on that photo shoot, or maybe like a Step Up AU? rival dancers? (in space?) GO NUTS.

Julika Hawksword (Hythrun), Charisee (Hythrun)

DNWs: character death, suicide, mental illness, grieving, Charisee's husband/marriage, Alija Eaglespike, the Sisters of the Blade or Karien centric fic

I would love either femslash or friendship fic focused on Charisee and Julika. I would also be happy with anything Julika focused that includes Kalan or Queen Shananara or magic or worldbuilding for the Sorcerers Collective and/or the Harshini's involvement with the Collective. Or Charisee focused that explores the lesser gods more (especially female ones), gives her a hopeful post-marriage future, or includes Adrina or bringing Charisee in closer contact with the Wolfblades. I am also okay with fic about OFCs, un-requested female characters (excepting my DNWs), or fic focused on just one or the other of my requested characters.

Tess and Lexy were my two favourite characters on Lip Service, and so I was overly attached to the doomed one-sided crush. I'd really love to see something post-series or canon divergent that explores that but turns them both towards a healthier dynamic. I think they could be really cute together, and I think they both deserve someone who likes them back. Or alternatively if you prefer gen I'd love to see them move past it and develop a really strong friendship despite the momentary awkwardness.

I simply adore this movie, but I feel like some of the Henry/Pike potential got a little lost in the love triangle. I would love anything at all giving them more time together, especially soon after the end of the movie where they're still getting to know each other and there's room for early dates and more courtship, missing scenes from the movie that expand their courtship a little, or happy ending future fic. I am also very open to AUs that remove the character death or Dean content from the movie somehow. I also really love how this movie handles Pike's anxiety and how the town rallies around him and their relationship.

If you don't ship them I'd also be fine with gen fic where he stayed closer to her side and was her magical right hand man.

I'd love anything that focuses on good witches, on the light hearted moments and world building aspects of the movie, that explores the slightly Harry Potter-esque wonderous world within a world aspect hinted at, or explores the awesome found family potential in this movie. I would be very happy with something focused on just Chloe, or on her relationship with Miranda (femslash or gen welcome!) or her teaming-up-to-save-the-world thing with Kaulder, or with good witch OFCs and worldbuilding.

Gregory \"Dolly\" Parton

Dolly is my favourite character out of the team, so I decided to request him only. You can write about only him or include as many of the others as you like. I enjoy the whole vibe of the team, so anything with everyone included is cool. Be it on a dig, a social gathering, the four (or any number of them with Dolly) hanging out at the U...

But if you maybe want to give me f.e. some backstory for Dolly, that's also greatly appreciated! Maybe you want to write about him teaching a class or dealing with some students or tell me what he does in his spare time. Or tell me about his own student days?

Things I love in stories: humour, happy endings, loyalty, trust between characters, characters with different skills and strengths working together for a common goal, dialogue, epistolary fic, well set scenes, plot, in-character-writing

DNW: AUs (please stay in the setting of the show), character death or mutilation, shaming, character bashing, bloodsports and the like, things like mpreg or genderswapping, or non-con - and that's pretty much the only stuff I'll rule out. I'm no great fan of oral sex, though, but I'll read it if it's well written.

Signed Sealed Delivered (TV) 

This is such a sweet and positive show! I just love it to bits. It's funny without making fun of any of their slightly odd personalities. It's touching to see the lengths they go to on the job. It's adorable to follow the two couples' relationships developing. 

I really would like to leave it up to you if you want to write about the team or one of the couples or focus on a single person. These four characters are all wonderful and interesting, so I'd be happy with anything you'd come up with. Some ideas: a double-date of the couples, a lost letter turns out to be for one of them (what could that be?), character-exploration of one or more of them, what did they do before they became postal detectives (f.e. were they on the street as postmen?)...

I usually don't like AUs, but with these fours I'd be happy to read how they fare in a different setting. So if you have an idea for an AU, feel free to go with it.

Hustle 
Albert Stroller, Ash Morgan

Deciding which characters to request and which to leave optional isn't easy. I adore Ben and Eddie always brings in a comical element, but really Ash and Albert have grown on me so much, I ultimately decided to request only them. Kudos and 1000 thanks if you also include the others, but these two are set. :-)

I like that they seem to have a long backstory and seem so very close at times. Just sometimes there's a scene where you get a glimpse of just how much they mean to each other. It's these close friendships that I adore beside the loyalty of the whole team to each other.

Some ideas: Ash visits Albert while he's in prison, something set before the show as the two seem to go back such a long way, a missing scene somewhere(?), Ash needs to take on the part of roper for some reason and Albert is teaching him, the team always seems to share a place - so something trivial happening there between jobs? How do they spend a holiday (as the team seems to do even that together)?

If you feel like writing smut (and actually feel it fits the show), feel free to go for it. And I'm not averse to power dynamics, bondage, or other kinks as long as it's a consensual.

Vermilion - Molly Tanzer 
Coriander Gorey, Lou Merriwether

(more details about general and canon-specific likes in the linked letter)

Basically, I want to know what happens to these two when they go (back) to San Francisco. And, ideally, I want them to get together, or have gotten together. Because this is a canon where plot and ensemble character interaction is paramount, I'd prefer no PWP

Prompt ideas:
(1) RomCom: How does Lou finally clue into the fact that Coriander is into her? Does Coriander have to keep dropping bigger and bigger hints before Lou catches on? Are Ailien and/or Wilhelm and/or Bo subtly or not-so-subtly trying to help out? 

(2) Adventure: Lou lost one of her lenses during the novel: how does a psychopomp get a replacement for very expensive, specialized equipment? Can you even get such things in San Francisco? How do she and Coriander go about acquiring a new one? Maybe Coriander takes it on herself to find one as a surprise-- and ends up embroiling herself (and perforce Lou) in some kind of illicit occult-objects smuggling &amp; mobsters intrigue?

(3) Worldbuilding-centric Casefic: Get Lou and Coriander and any other of the characters involved in any cool alt-history-steampunk thing suggested by an 1870’s San Francisco with talking bears and sea lions!
(3a)Maybe they tangle with Emperor Norton?
(3b)Or get called in to disperse spirits in the military prison on Alcatraz (helping a Native American OC break out POWs from the Indian Wars?)
(3c)The Great Diamond Hoax of 1872
(3d)Anything involving sea lions.

General DNWS:
No graphic descriptions of body horror or gore or extreme violence
No on-screen non-con or torture. (References and background are fine, but I'd really prefer that they not be at the center of the story, even off-screen).
No nuclear war, genocide, apocalyptic destruction, or death on a massive scale.

I'd prefer no PWP and in fact what I'd like best is a plotty fic -- even if the plot is about trivial, day-to-day things -- where these characters and their love for each other (I hope) can shine, to whatever degree of explicitness you please. My favorite thing in shippy-fic is seeing the gestures and displays of affection and passion and concern that happen along the way of the plot. I'd also prefer not to have a story that uses Lou and Coriander to focus on the hardships facing same-sex and interracial couples in the period (although certainly feel free to acknowledge any and all historical social issues that come up).

Campaign (Podcast) 
Lyntel'luroon (Campaign), Fentara Ren (Campaign), Yarris Gurt, OD-43 (Campaign)

(more details at the linked letter)

You don't need to include all 4 characters: I'm requesting, basically, along two separate lines of potential prompts:

(1)  <b>Lyn/Fentara Ren</b> The Lyn and Fentara Ren backstory! How do they know each-other?  Is Fentara one of Lyn’s ‘friends I knew in the military from my time in ExplorCorps who now work for the Empire?’. Is she the princess Lyn was involved with? (YES to both of these, if you please). 

(1a) I’d love the adventure where they met and got together, especially if there are hints of the divergent paths they are going to take once the Empire takes over. Maybe Fentara was on the squad providing security for one of Lyn's ExploraCorps missions? Maybe they met at uni on Coruscant?

(1b) Or, what about the last mission they were on together, when the horizon was darkening and their political differences started to be irreconcilable. An unhappy, wistful ending or/and bitter angsty breakup fic is fine in this case, the darker the better! I want to read about difficult choices, and the pressures of encroaching space!fascism, and the betrayal of realizing that your lover is willing to join an organization that doesn’t consider you a full person.

(2) <b>Yaris Gurt, OD-44</b>: I requested these two characters, but what I really want is ensemble fic: wacky hijinks and workplace shenanigans on the dysfunctional Imperial Base in the Roach System. I’m in love with the disaster evil!NPCs of this arc, and I would love fic about day-to-day life on this base just before the Mynock crew arrives: the focus could be on any or all of them (and with or without any and all pairings):

(2a)Yaaris Gurt’s fanfiction! Maybe she covertly processes her workplace shenanigans by writing ‘Regency-Era’ slash fic? Is there anyone she likes on the Base? [What  is Regency Era for Star Wars? Heck, if you wanted to pastiche what her fic might look like, and write the faux!space!heyer tale of true love, dastardly dueling, and last-minute rescue starring self-insert!Yaris and a bunch of people with names on the German Name + Tomato model, I’d love that!]

(2b) OD-44/Yaris: I’m always here for the unrequited love of an AI for an officer of an Evil Space Empire. Full stop. 

(2c) OD-44: Do they hate Captain Drine because of some perceived (or real) slight to the engineer?  Is it normal droid protocal to label all the humans they interact with with emoji? Or is that one of OD-44's peculiar quirks? An ensemble fic from OD’s exasperated/hostile perspective would also be great!

(2d) I didn't request other characters from the ensemble, like D'Phn, Zoth, Shinro, Drine, but feel free to include them to whatever degree you like (I have some prompts about possible directions in the linked letter)

A GENERAL NOTE

-I’m writing this letter as of episode 90; if we matched on this fandom, I imagine you are basically caught up, too, since I requested characters that were very recently introduced. But if episodes to come introduce new details or backstory points, feel free either to incorporate them, if you want, or to ignore it. You don’t need to worry about spoilers--I’ll be caught up--, but, conversely, I am really not fussed at all about keeping to the letter of Kanan.

General DNWS:
-No graphic descriptions of body horror or gore or extreme violence
-No on-screen non-con or torture. (References and background are fine, but I'd really prefer that they not be at the center of the story, even off-screen).
-No nuclear war, genocide, apocalyptic destruction, or death on a massive scale. (References to canon events are fine)
-Please do not blow up planets
-Strongly prefer no PWP or smut/erotica

Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Justice of Toren One Esk Nineteen | Breq

(more details about general and canon-specific likes in the linked letter)

What I'd especially love is pre-canon backstory for Breq -- whether about Justice of Toren One Esk 19 when it was still part of Justice of Toren or about Breq finding her way in those 19 years. 

Some plot-bunnies that have been picking at me:

(1) The lieutenant who first introduced One Esk to music. Why couldn't she get any of her fellow-officers interested in joining her? Was it because she played a 'scandalous' instrument and was shy about asking for partners (or was rebuffed when she did ask)? Was she from a 'very provincial' House and therefore snubbed? It seems like she must have been a 'favorite' -- but was she? Did she just view One Esk as a convenient tool for picking up the other parts, or did she come to treat her Ship differently once it became her musical partner? I would also love details of Radchaai culture and politics from this period nearly 2000 years before Ancillary Justice, although still 1000 years into Anaander Mianaai's rule, when the empire was smaller (whatever that means for an enormous galactic empire), even more socially stratified-- and perhaps closer tied-in to the original dyson sphere? What were the Entertainments like? What musical styles were trendy? What did this lieutenant's tea-set look like?

(2)The epic that Breq sings in Ancillary Sword and mentions was (a) composed 1500 years ago was banned in the Radch but (b) still circulates outside of it. I'm equally intrigued by the possibilities of both of these points:

(2a) Did Breq only come to learn about this poem after Justice of Toren was destroyed? If yes, I'd love to know the circumstances of her visit to one of those 'places outside the Radch' where dissident Radchaai poetry is circulating. Are there systems that have universities with 'Departments of Radch Studies'? Or were there always Radchaai diaspora communities out there, descended from people who fled Anaander Mianaai's rule for one reason or another? Breq interacting with either of these groups -- or in any other situation you think up where she comes across this revisionist, anti-Anaander epic -- would be fascinating. 

(2a- corollary) If you want to write academia-fic about Breq being That Person at a public lecture who gets into a fight with a prominent specialist in Radchaai Studies or something… I love that idea in principle, but please don't straw-man historical scholarship and academia. For Yuletide, I do not want gotcha-fic about my day job.

(2b) On the other hand, Justice of Toren was around when the poem was written. I'd love a story where the poet was one of One Esk's lieutenants, or where one of Justice of Toren's Esk officers somehow got involved in whatever political or literary (or both) upset surrounded the poem. I'm 100% fine with dark-fic for this: One-Esk having to shoot a favorite officer-- even, heck, Justice of Toren being ordered to forget the song (and only coming back to find it later…?

(3) If you've read Provenance, and are interested in writing a crossover, I have a prompt for that in the linked letter (spoiler-hidden for those who have not yet read Provenance)

(4) If none of this inspires, feel free to do anything set during or post-canon as well! I'd love more about Breq learning to work with the crew and Mercy of Kalr in those days between the end of Justice and the beginning of Sword-- maybe even from the perspective of one of the MoK crew (here I'd be really interested in themes of loyalty and authority). 

A COUPLE GENERAL NOTES:
-I am only interested in gen-fic about Breq- the relationships I am interested in seeing her in are ones of loyalty, duty, mutual obligations, alliance, protection  (any and all pairings of other characters in the background is fine).
-Please use canon pronouns.
-I have read Provenance and all of the short stories set in this universe, and so am fine with incorporating or alluding to any world-building or other details from any of those works, if you should wish to do so.

&nbsp;

DNWS:
-No graphic descriptions of body horror or gore or extreme violence
-No on-screen non-con or torture. (References and background are fine, but I'd really prefer that they not be at the center of the story, even off-screen).
-No nuclear war, genocide, apocalyptic destruction, or death on a massive scale. (References to canon and canon-typical events are fine)
-Please do not blow up planets (references to canon events are ok)
-Strongly prefer no PWP/erotica/smut

I love the atmosphere of these books and the way that the history is tied so vividly to the house and the people who live in it. Any sort of story about Tolly or his grandmother, Mrs Oldknow would be wonderful but here are a few ideas that you could go with - What happens to Tolly after the books? Are there any other children that he meets from the past or from the future? What was Mrs Oldknow's childhood like and when did she find out about the Others? What happened during the holidays that we didn't see? Is there a missing moment from the books that you'd like to explore?

Honestly I just want more of the probes interacting with each other -- and possibly also with Earth, but mostly each other. I really just like their banter. So, really, anything you want to give me will be fine. Pick your favorite bit of pop culture or obscure sports trivia (or, really, obscure anything trivia) and the probes can talk about it! They can talk to whoever on Earth you want! Or maybe one of them could actually find something cool in space. Also if you would like to do some kind of sequel with what happens after Nine wakes up again, that would be great. You can add more probes if you want. I'm sure there are some out there. Also I am kind of curious about what nations not obsessed with football think of the football thing, so if you want to make the probes talk to other countries, that could be fun.

I just want Bobby Drake to be happy. I am enjoying how the comic is dealing with his coming-out issues and him attempting to balance that with being a superhero, so more of that would be welcome. I love seeing him be a competent superhero; I like when he's a scary-powerful omega-level mutant and you don't forget it. 

I also enjoy his friendship with all his teammates (current and former) and I did enjoy his antagonism with Daken (although I am not requesting Daken as this is not a must-have) but if you want to write more of that I would be there for it. Gen fic and pairing fic are both great. If you want to make Bobby happy by hooking him up with someone (porn is fine by me) I would be up for that, choice of male characters at your discretion -- he can go for a superhuman (I see Daken and Johnny Storm in the tagset) or the cute guy from the last issue, whichever. I would prefer a focus on adult Bobby rather than his teenage self.

Okay, yes, I am one of the people who watched the pilot episode and started shipping it and then was devastated. I do ship them but gen is great too. There are a lot of options here -- anything flashback in the seven years before the pilot is an obvious contender. Loyalty, trust (perhaps a slow and rocky road to loyalty and trust), all that good stuff. If you're slashing them, how they get together (or if they don't; I am fine with there being a lot of one-sided pining). It could be time for some good old-fashioned Star Trek sex pollen.

For non-flashback stories: You could show me how Michael is coping (or not) now. You could find a way to bring Philippa back in a fix-it (assuming canon doesn't go there).

The tie-in novel shows Philippa as having an amazing reputation within Starfleet -- even Captain Pike (these are his Enterprise days, of course) is intimidated by her, and it might be fun to play around with that. How does she (or Michael) feel about her reputation?

Also, I am into anything involving Vulcan culture, and I would also be interested in knowing how Michael's upbringing is involved in or affects their relationship (either in a slash or gen way).

The Unstoppable Wasp 
Nadia Pym (Unstoppable Wasp), Janet Van Dyne (Unstoppable Wasp)

The thing I enjoyed most about this series was watching Jan Van Dyne suddenly have a teenager and learn to deal. I especially enjoyed the Jan POV of the last few issues as she basically comes to terms with having Nadia in her life now. I like how Jan is an established competent superhero, unfazed by anything, an Avenger of at least a decade's standing -- as well as a fashion designer -- and now, suddenly, she finds herself responsible for Nadia and has to come to terms with this whole new set of responsibilities. She's been Avengers chair more times than I can count, in charge of so many people... and now she has to figure out this. I want to know what that's like.

Nadia interacting with the adults around her (in canon, this is Jan, Bobbi, Matt, and Jarvis) was also great and I enjoyed her relentless optimism even in the face of extreme danger, as well as watching her adapt to the non-Red Room world. Maybe Jan could help her more with that. I like her meeting science-y superheroes and fangirling them; she could do some more of that. If there are any Marvel scientists (especially women) whom you would like Nadia to meet, please bring them in!

Anything post-series that you want to write would be welcome, especially from Jan's point of view, incorporating other grown-up Avengers if you so desire (although I would prefer if you did not bring Hank back, please). How do Jan and Nadia's lives continue on together? How does Jan deal with being a superhero and having a teenage daughter? How do their other teammates feel about their lives? Can everyone just come hang out at Nadia and Jan's place for a bit? Domestic Avengers nostalgia is very welcome.

Moon (2009) 
Sam Bell

What I enjoy about this movie: the setting’s isolated, large, empty, but with an unnerving sense of entrapped claustrophobia. GERTY as a robot is a great subversion of HAL-type robots-gone-wrong; he remains steadfast to help Sam, while the people behind the operation remain steadfast to use Sam. And Sam Bell himself tangles in a plot of some of my favorite concepts-- time-loop adjacent plot lines, clones, meeting-yourself scenarios, relentless persistence, self-sacrifice. 

Anything that leans off of these feelings is great on me. As for ideas, I’d like to see something that either takes place with any of the Sam Bells that don’t appear in the movie. 

The original Sam Bell is interesting-- how was his time on the base? How much did he know about the clone project? How does the recent news of Lunar Industry’s unethical practices affected him? Does he meet the Sam Bell from the moon? There’s a lot to work with here-- I’d prefer to see him at least somewhat complicit/guilty about what happened. 

Other ideas concern the Sam Bells from immediately after the movie-- the ones left on the moon. How much clean-up can Lunar Industries accomplish? What do you do with that many terminal clones? What’s even the right choice? Maybe the fic’s from the perspective of one of the later clones, or more than one of the clones. Maybe it’s from the perspective of the Lunar Industries clean-up crew, or maybe from the perspective of the rescue mission crew. Whichever way it’s sliced, seeing how to even begin unraveling this mess would be great to see.

Arrival (2016) 
Ian Donnelly, Louise Banks

What I like about this canon: Despite dubious linguistics, I really loved how this movie challenged the perspective of time. Non-linear perspective is such an interesting idea, and I enjoyed how this was portrayed in the movie as scenes weaving into each other. I like the themes of knowing how something will end, but making the decision anyway, and would love to see more on that.

I also loved how grounded the fim’s treatment of aliens felt. Both Ian and Louise reacted very genuinely to what was going on, and I loved how their relationship built out of that. I also really enjoyed their relationship to their respective fields, especially Louise trying to explain the need to understand language from building blocks and the importance of communication. 

A couple of potential things I’d like to see:

We got the skeleton of how Ian and Louise’s relationship fell apart, but I’d love to see the details of it, especially from Ian’s point of view. Trying to make a linear understanding on a non-linear perspective is something that’s very complicated, and weird, and interesting! I’d love something that either gets into the weeds of how he couldn’t handle the relationship, or just something on small moments where interacting with Louise was off, and unsettling, maybe.

Louise’s perspective is also fantastic-- I loved when the film did illustrate her perspective outside of time, and how her perception flips from scene to scene. The end of the movie, with her living through many different time perspectives all at once, was lovely to watch! I’d love to see that concept expanded. 

Similarly, how does the world deal with this brand new language, this brand new perspective? How does the world adapt to it? How do individual people adapt to it? I’d love to see different perspectives-- maybe someone who doesn’t have the same acceptance of understanding how things end.

Fire Emblem Echoes: Mou Hitori no Eiyuu Ou | Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia 
Sonya (Shadows of Valentia), Anthiese | Celica (Shadows of Valentia)

Why I like these characters: I loved both Sonya and Celica! I think they’re both very closed-off about their past, for similar reasons, but carry that weight very differently. Sonya is unyielding and distant, but self-assured in her distance and in her bitterness. Celica doesn’t carry the burden of secrets nearly as well. She keeps a polite distance from people, but never comes across as she really wants to. It’s an interesting dynamic to me. As for their interactions, I also really enjoyed Sonya’s blunt teasing of Celica in her first base conversation, along with the prodding to speak her mind more. 

For what I want to see between them-- gen or romance is good! I really liked their base conversations, and think there’s a lot of common ground between them, even if it goes unstated. Anything that emphasizes this common ground is something I want to see. Mostly, I want to see some kind of post-canon interaction between them, whether it be something as simple as Sonya visiting Celica at her new post, or something as complicated as Celica visiting the new witch of Nuibaba’s castle. 

Potential prompts:

Post game dungeoning: how they interact together, faced with endless peril and endless witches. The post game dungeons are so dire, and relentless in their tragedy, I’d like to see how they hold up, and potentially support each other in that.

Discussions on how they relate to family, in general-- maybe this is set post game, right before Sonya leaves on her quest. Maybe this is set right before the final battle. Either way, an almost-honest talk between them would be great. 

Post-game, Sonya’s ending. It’s such a ripe ending for fix-its or playing it straight, and I’d love to see Celica involved in it. Does she help out Sonya, after nearly becoming a witch herself? Does she only get involved after rumors surface of a new and powerful witch in Nuibaba’s castle? Either way, I’d love to see the story. 

Introspection! I feel like Sonya is a strong POV character, in that she has a lot of lived experience that ties into her perception of the people around her. I’d love to see her perspective on Celica, throughout the war.

Angst is fine. Fluff is fine. Angst with fluff or fluff with angst is totally my jam. Smut is cool, gen is cool. I'm honestly really easy when it comes to that stuff.

Characterwise - I'm cool with OCs in the fic, but please let it be Jamie/Cathy-centric.

I'm TOTALLY cool with AUs or things set during their relationship that we don't actually get to see on stage. THOUGH one thing I've honestly always loved to see -- is the NEXT 5 years. Wherein Cathy finally finds her success and Jamie is down on his luck... and they meet again. What happens when their circumstances are reversed. No crossovers, please.

American Werewolf in London (1981) 
Jack Goodman (AWiL 1981), David Kessler (AWiL 1981)

[DNWs: self-harm, eating disorders, noncanonical suicide, child sexual abuse, unrequested incest. I don't want to read explicit sex involving characters under 16.]

What happens if somebody does take David at his word about the whole werewolf thing? Anything about David's post-mauling predicament and his changing sense of self as a newly minted part-time monster, the mundane grief at the loss of a friend and the supernatural stirrings of his brand-new werewolfism as they both coincide, or Jack's as a reluctant dead guy whose ultimate fate is closely linked to his best friend's. Fix-it fic or fic that makes it all even worse, more uneasy haunting, pre-canon college fic, more European backpacking trip adventures where the plot goes off on a tangent into a different horror subgenre entirely (Wicker Man-esque folk horror? vampires? pod people? something else?) or more late-night werewolf/revenant heart to hearts… is there another set of horror tropes these two could stumble into on their way? The best thing about this canon is that you're 100% justified in writing horror or comedy angles on all this -- goofy companionable moments, backstory friendship fic, and coming to terms with your fate? Freaky body horror, creeping psychological distress, and grody zombie stuff? Or anything in between, have at it. Long story short, I'd love anything about these two (separately or together) or about their relationship,. Something where David dies and it's Jack who survives to get super haunted, or where they're both unlucky American werewolves?

Ship-wise, I would love Jack/David in any flavor -- collegiate, doomed, corpsey --but I'm up for anything.

Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) 
Robert Ford (Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford)

[DNWs: self-harm, eating disorders, noncanonical suicide, child sexual abuse, unrequested incest. I don't want to read explicit sex involving characters under 16.]

This film is a paean to tragic gazes and life-defining mistakes! Guilt and fear! Fantasies and obsessions! (Also, murdering your idols, my biggest and most inexplicable narrative kink.) I'd like to read some fic about Bob, his perspective and the track he's on before and then after his aspirations go murderously off the rails. It's tough to talk about Bob in this movie without dealing with his relationship with Jesse, so I would be extremely enthusiastic about any fic exploring their incredibly fraught relationship or a snippet of the weird bullying-worshipful interplay between them. Explore some of Bob's \"everything wonderful that could come true\" scenarios, or explore an AU where everything goes even worse for everybody involved in the James gang. I'd love dirtybadwrong hideout fic, or  fic about Bob's messed-up relationship with his brother Charley, either early on when they're low-key jostling for position or at the time of the titular assassination, or afterward where the lines of the roles they play out on stage and their real-life treachery start to blur. On exploration of any of the parallels Bob sees between Jesse and himself, for better or worse. Does Bob have a corresponding brutal streak? What happens when that buried viciousness comes out to play? 

Ship-wise, I ship creepy, ambivalent Jesse/Bob and doomed, incestuous, tubercular Bob/Charley, as well as Robert Ford/Dorothy Evans set during their time in the West.

Dark City (1998) 
Daniel Schreber

[DNWs: self-harm, eating disorders, noncanonical suicide, child sexual abuse, unrequested incest. I don't want to read explicit sex involving characters under 16.]

Anything about unlucky Schreber and his unique position in the constantly-shifting creepy noir landscape of the city. Trauma-bonding and reluctant collaboration with the Strangers, five times people's memory implants failed catastrophically and one time Schreber's own memory rewrite did, post-canon rebuilding alongside Murdoch and Anna, or pre-canon sinister/benevolent mindfucks of the man who will one day be John Murdoch with bonus guilt, quasi-psychological navelgazing, and weird H.R. Gigery horror. 

I love the Expressionist ambiguity of Schreber's role, and would love fic about his responsibilities as both manipulator and hapless go-between, his guilty self-preservation or any of the undoubtedly lousy things he's been through whenever a screw-up or a moral qualm keeps him from doing the Strangers' bidding up to their standards. Or on another note entirely, something where his role in Murdoch's mind <i>is</i> a full-on Dr. Caligari and he's not the unwilling tormentor of a bunch of unwilling people but a more banal authority figure trying to navigate Murdoch or Emma's murky subconscious. Or go the film noir route and write mistrustful threesomes, nice bathhouse fic, possible backstories, horror fic that hinges on shattered memories and creepy doppelgangers… 

Ship-wise, I enjoy Schreber/Murdoch, Schreber/Murdoch/Emma, and Schreber/any of the Strangers.

Dark Tower - Stephen King 
The Man in Black (Dark Tower - Stephen King)

[DNWs: self-harm, eating disorders, noncanonical suicide, child sexual abuse, unrequested incest. I don't want to read explicit sex involving characters under 16.]

Anything about this jerk and his long, long track record! I'd love fic about the man in black's time in Gilead as Marten Broadcloak -- his treachery and involvement in Farson's rebellion, his twisted affair with Gabrielle and ingratiation of himself with Steven Deschain, the long shadow he casts over young Roland. Necromancer adventures, daily activities in the lives of treacherous wizards, or anything about his messed up nemesis relationship with Roland -- an extended version of their palaver at the end of The Gunslinger, the man in black popping up in Roland's dreams or needling at him from the jawbone he carries around there for a while, another go-round where they encounter each other in different circumstances or get to have a more climactic final showdown. 

Anything about his role as henchman to the Crimson King (getting drafted to his service as a disaffected farmboy, brokering a childcare deal with Mia,  the brief appearance he makes to screw with Father Callahan, getting completely pwned by Mordred -- AU where he's stuck as Mordred's reluctant babysitter for a prolonged period of time or where the two of them bond inasmuch as an evil warlock and a baby werespider <i>can</i> bond?) or what happens if his aspirations to treachery in that role too don't fail like they do in canon, or at least fail differently. Or anything about his multiple identities/names and roles in other worlds and timelines, the weird way he seems to integrate post-apocalyptic medieval fantasy Western know-how with 70s drifter knowledge. 

Ship-wise, I ship this tittering jackass with everybody -- Roland, Gabrielle, Steven, both Gabrielle and Steven, Eddie and Susannah, Callahan, Maerlyn… the world is your dirtybadwrong wizard oyster.

Philip Marlowe - Raymond Chandler 
Terry Lennox

[DNWs: self-harm, eating disorders, noncanonical suicide, child sexual abuse, unrequested incest. I don't want to read explicit sex involving characters under 16.]

Terry Lennox, past, present, and future! I would love pre-canon fic dealing with his military experiences, what exactly he got up to during WWII and the kind of mark it made on him -- the aftermath of saving Starr and Menendez's lives and his time as a prisoner of war, his time among the idle rich before he and Marlowe cross paths, the impression it seems to make on him as well as how easily he sort of melts into that milieu as a good-looking youth with a mostly-fixed face. He's appealing and polite but he's got a hell of a lot going on under the washed-out exterior, so I'd love anything about that from introspection to plotty casefic.

Canon-era fic where he's in Marlowe's orbit pre-faked-death, a missing scene between the two of them, or where Sylvia's fate is different and all the moving parts of the novel's two main plotlines spiral off in different directions. I'd also be down for post-canon fic set in Lennox's Mexico, or where Lennox returns to bedevil Marlowe again --  there's a lot of levels of identity trouble at work there and you can tread lightly if you want to, but I'm interested in all the complexities there.

Ship-wise, I love Lennox/Marlowe and I ship him with basically all of his war buddies, both separately and together. I'd also be really interested in fic exploring Terry's canonical marriages.

We Were Liars - E. Lockhart

This book hinges on a pretty big plot twist; I have prompts that relate to those spoilers directly in my letter but these prompts are spoiler-free.] 

Sunbaked, delirious, badly-thought-out summer adventures with the Sinclairs -- on the island (alternate Summer 16s, or a Summer 15 that culminates in a different act of desperation?) or beyond. (Something where Cadence and Gat run away together? Where Cadence and Mirren make a break for it? Or another scenario where Cadence is present for Gat like he's present for her in canon?) I'd love something where the atmosphere of Edenic possibility and claustrophobic family restrictions is amped up in another way too -- something where Cadence and Gat are stepsiblings, or they're both girls, or where Mirren is the third person in their relationship. 

More scenes of the messed-up romance of Cadence and Gat, teenage heart-to-hearts with a foregone conclusion just on the horizon, or something where the Liars cook up a different plan to secure their future and there's a different kind of cataclysmic fallout. Or if their admittedly thinly sketched plan went off without a hitch, what would have happened afterward? How would the Liars have held up under that kind of scrutiny -- or the internal scrutiny that comes from getting exactly what you want at an uncommon cost? Or if you're interested in historical AUs at all, I'd love a take on the Liars' plight set some time earlier in the 20th century -- from the Roaring 20s to the 90s -- or otherwise relocated to a different time and place.

Ship-wise, I ship Cadence/Gat, Cadence/Mirren, and Cadence/Mirren/Gat.

Battle Creek (TV) 
Milt Chamberlain

I originally fell in love with this show because of Milt, with his relentless helpfulness and hyper-competence and ludicrous degree of luck and the occasional slip suggesting there was something else there.

The show ended by giving us one big piece of information about Milt, but that still left us with plenty of unanswered questions that I would loved to see explored through fic. Why has he gone through twelve assistants? Why won't his mother speak to him? Who did he once try to save who didn't want to be saved? Was there more to him being sent to Battle Creek than the story he gave Russ? Does Milt even know the real reason he was sent to Battle Creek? I'd love to see any of those things explored. I'd also love to just see more of Milt being his helpful, competent, damaged and occasionally snarky self.

Being Human (US/Canada) 
Aidan Waite, Nora Sergeant

First off, please feel free to treat this as an either/or request. I'd be delighted to read about just Aidan or Nora without the other. (Both are also welcome, of course, if that's where inspiration takes you!)

So. I loved BHUS, and Aidan and Nora were my two favourites from the main characters. I love Aidan's courage. I love that he fights so hard to be good when it would be so much easier to go back to being a monster. I love the way he takes care of his roommates--not just protecting them, but making sure they're okay emotionally and comforting them when they're not. And I love Nora's strength and the way she learned to thrive in the strange supernatural world that she was unwillingly thrust into.

I'm always happy to read about Aidan and Nora after they finally become friends, or something where all four roommates are hanging out or facing down a challenge together.

I'd also love to read something about how the supernatural intersects with Aidan's and/or Nora's work during the series, or pre-series for Aidan or post-series for Nora, e.g., ghosts (how did Aidan first meet Tony DePaulo)?, people with supernatural problems, supernatural beings, or their own abilities helping and/or hindering their work.

For Aidan, I'd enjoy something that explores his past. When and how did he learn so much about how magic worked? (Did he date a witch? Befriend one? Battle against one?) What was it like for him when he was more tightly integrated into the vampire community? What led him to decide to stop killing humans?

For Nora, I'd enjoy a peek into her life post-series. How things turn out for her, or the decision to have kids with Josh and concerns that might have arisen from that, or dealing with all of the werewolf wives after their husbands died, maybe? Or maybe something about her friendship with Kat. How did they meet? Do they ever reconcile? Or meet and not reconcile?

I liked the ending of this show, but I can also see other ways it could have gone, so I'm pretty neutral on whether you want to keep the ending, change the ending, or write something set earlier in the show that has nothing to do with the ending. Whatever makes you happy. I was never really sold on Aidan/Sally, though, so I'd prefer to stay away from a story where their relationship is the primary focus.

The Collector (Canada TV) 
Maya Kandinski (The Collector), Morgan Pym (The Collector)

I'd love to see a story that explores Morgan and Maya's relationship after Maya finds out the truth about who Morgan is and what he does. Something that answers some of the questions left unanswered at the end of the show would be lovely, or something addressing the UST, or just a client-of-the-week case where Maya knowing the truth enables her to help Morgan in some way or where she learns more about his life and experiences. Gen, UST, and full-out ship fic would all be equally awesome.

If you want to go in a completely different direction, something about Maya investigating the supernatural aspects on her own or more on her friendship with Taylor would be awesome. I'd also enjoy something about Morgan's hobby as a medical researcher. What other medical advances has he made over the years? Or maybe just something about how Morgan fills his time--all those sleepless nights!--apart from the work he does. If you're going one of these routes, I'm okay with only including one of the two of them  in the story.

Intelligence (US TV 2014) 
Gabriel Vaughn, Riley Neal

I love that Gabriel and Riley are both super-competent and that both regularly get moments to shine. I love how protective they are of each other. I love the snark. I love that Riley is willing to protect Gabriel, but refuses to be the one to keep him in line--that she decides early on that he has the right to look for his wife and she's not going to try to stop him. I also love that she pushes everyone, including him, to remember that he's still human. I love that they both do what they think is right, rather than what they're ordered to do. And I love how much they respect and trust each other.

As far as story ideas go, I'm always up for mission fic, especially if it involves new and interesting uses for the chip. I'm also interested in following up on any of the threads from the show, like the Athens list or finding the sleeper agent whom the Flood was hoping would be elected president, or maybe tracking down some of the other Tigers from the photo, or finding out what Leland was up to with Mei Chen, or looking at whether Amelia really turned (and why she warned Gabriel about the hospital bombing).

For a less plot-driven approach, tropes like drunken confessions and undercover as a couple and minor hurt/comfort (especially if Gabriel is doing the comforting) could definitely be fun.

Or jump ahead and look at where Gabriel and Riley--and the program--might be in ten years.

I’ve played everything, all the way through Witcher III: Blood &amp; Wine. This game series was just fantastic, but Witcher III was absolutely one of my favorite games of all time. I loved the world, and the gameplay and the rich and detailed storylines. I absolutely loved playing as Geralt and everything about being a Witcher. And, maybe it’s because of my previous decisions through Witcher II, but I just love Vernon Roche as well.  And yeah, I kind of unapologetically ship Geralt/Roche.  I don’t absolutely need ship-fic by any means, but would definitely enjoy more adventures involving these two. There’s so much room in the canon to explore new adventures, monsters or even revisit old friends/enemies. Heck, even just Vernon and Geralt hanging out in his villa in Toussaint would be great!

This movie was one of those surprises that I'd never even heard of before finding it available on-demand. I watched because the cast list looked amazing (and it was!), and was rather shocked by how much I enjoyed the movie. Whether you'd want to explore more slice-of-life at the monastery, or the various relationships between the brothers prior to the events of the movie, or focus on some events of their journey with the relic, or delve into the past of the Mute, or even play around with a possible 'fix-it' for the end, I'd welcome it all.

This show… I just loved it so much. *sigh* I decided to give Damien a chance because I both adore Bradley James, and also love the original Omen movie. And to me, the show did not disappoint. The story, the setting, the characters… they were all great. It had such ridiculous potential for ongoing seasons and I was rather gutted that it got cancelled. I’d absolutely love to read something that focuses on Damien, either during the show, or delves into what happens after or explores his relationship with any of the other requested characters (or any combination thereof – you needn’t include all 4 requested characters, however) would also be awesome.

The Death of the Necromancer - Martha Wells 

This book is full of clever characters who don't make stupid mistakes. It is funny, and scary, and smart.  I loved the characters, with their distinctive thought processes, their relationship dynamics, and the banter.  I loved how everyone wound up after the necromancer-villain without even being entirely sure how it happened.  

I have also read the Element of Fire and the Fall of Ile-Rien, so if you want to incorporate those stories too, feel free.  

Nicholas was a fascinating viewpoint character - his brand of cold logic layered over deep emotion (which seemed to mostly be vengefulness, but occasionally softer emotions too) made for very interesting motivations.  He was just so ruthless - his utter occasional utter incomprehension of more compassionate/forgiving social norms and emotions was pretty hilarious to me.

Gentleman Reynard Morane's core of honorability fit so oddly into the criminal underworld, but at the same time he really did manage to belong there.  He's got a deep, fascinating history as a brave man and also a very dangerous one, and his blend of cynicism and idealism make for a great character.  I'd love to see more of his past, maybe while he was still in the army, or perhaps how he settled in with the Queen's guard after the book ends.

Madeline's determination to be a stellar actress in spite of her successful criminal sideline was one of my favorite things about one of my favorite characters.  I loved Madeline's practicality, and how whenever Nicholas got too wrapped up in things she could bring him down.  I loved her contentious relationship with her grandmother, and how clearly they respected each other's determination even if they didn't understand each other's goals.

I am also incredibly fond of Arisilde.  He's a gentle person with a lot of anger, and I really respected how he made a conscious choice to not indulge in overt, destructive revenge in favor of spectacular, self-destructive revenge.  I would love to hear about his early education, his friendship with Edouard, or even about Isham finding him.

As for Ronsarde, I'd love to hear about some of his old cases with Doctor Halle, especially the ones where he was chasing Donatien.  Or why Ronsarde knew the queen personally, or perhaps how he's handling aging and still trying to hunt criminals.  Does he take Nicholas as a sort of successor?  That would be a clash of personalities and ideals worth seeing, although it would likely have to be a sort of stealth mentorship since Nic would probably never agree to it.

Idea Prompts:
I really want to know about that What If story where Nicholas's family hadn't quite managed to disinherit themselves from the throne of Ile-Rien and he was forced to marry the queen.  Was Nic's prediction that he and the queen could have conquered the world correct?  Would the queen have gotten rid of Madeline?  Would Madeline have dueled (or assassinated) the queen, or would Madeline have killed Nicholas instead?  More terrifyingly, what if Madeline and the queen got along?  Is Tremaine now the Crown Princess, and if so, how has that effected her?  She probably didn't spend most of her life pretending to be stupider than she is - or maybe she still did, if she's not the oldest or if she's not somehow related to the queen...  And how does the court handle the new royal power couple?  Nic was extremely wary of her majesty after only meeting her once, which was probably gratifying for the queen after so long being disregarded by her court.  Actually, I have to assume that the court would be underestimating them both right up to the point where they'd step over the twitching bodies of their enemies and people <i>still</i> wouldn't know how it happened.  What would Reynard and Ronsarde think about the whole thing?

I would also love to read about Nicholas and company building up Donatien's reputation, in the early days.  Or why exactly did Nicholas come up with the Donatien persona in the first place?  Or, when Madeline joined Nic's criminal empire, it was already well underway.  Did she have any difficulties fitting in with the rest of the group, and if so, how did she handle them?

Or I'd love to know about Dr. Halle's thought process in deciding to throw his lot in with Madeline when Ronsarde was dragged into the prison.  Why did he think it was a good idea?  Had he and Ronsarde worked with criminals before?  When did he recognize Madeline?

Fly By Night Series - Frances Hardinge 

There are many wonderful things about this book series!  The use of language is fun, and the characters' love of words is infectious.  The humor never rings false, from the slapstick - often provided by Saracen - to the wordplay, to the surreal events of the books.

Mosca Mye is practical, savvy and resourceful; she's a very smart protagonist who still manages to seem like a believable kid.  She's often unkind but her determination to go her own way and her streak of hidden idealism keep her sympathetic.  She's very cynical for a twelve year old - she never manages to accept kindness at face value without looking for the strings.  What, in her life before the series started, makes her that way?  Did she learn this attitude, or is it simply part of Mosca's personality?  Really, the only being she seems to trust unconditionally is Saracen.  

Eponymous Clent is another great character.  He's an obvious swindler who nevertheless has enough morals to try and look out for Mosca's best interests, in a sideways sort of way.  He does try and dump her on random people, but I always had the impression that in addition to not wanting to be bothered with a kid and dangerous goose, he also believes that it's truly to her benefit to <i>not</i> be involved in his life of crime.  Speaking of which, Clent has got an impressive rap sheet.  What were some of the circumstances of those crimes?  Or are there any really impressive crimes he's committed that he got away with, because no one pinned it on him?

Idea Prompts
What are some of the places Mosca and Clent visit?  What sort of mischief do they get into?  Do they continue to con their way across the continent, leaving angry folk behind them wherever they go?  Maybe they ran a particularly elegant scheme somewhere - Clent's swindling experience paired with Mosca's practicality makes a fabulous grifting team.  Do they topple any other regimes?

What does Saracen think of his new life on perpetual road trip?  What things/people/animals has he conquered, since leaving home?

Mosca is offered a place with the Locksmiths, and she manages to turn it down without insulting the Locksmiths enough to make unnecessary enemies, but the implication is that they're going to ask her again one day and they're going to expect a different answer that time.  How will that turn out?  Maybe Mosca refuses to join, and she and Clent start a subversive, creative revolution.  Maybe Mosca does join, and when she inevitably ends up in charge she changes the Locksmiths Guild to suit her own ends.  Maybe Mosca and Clent are quick enough that the Locksmiths never catch them again.  I'd love to hear what you think could happen!

Or tell me what happened in Mandelion or Toll-By-Night after Mosca, Saracen and Clent departed.  Life is very obviously very altered; how are people coping?

Or give me some world building about the Beloved!  They're such a large presence in the books, but we only hear bits and pieces about the individual ones.  I want to know about their histories - when and how and why they were adopted by the now fractured realm.  I want to hear about the Beloveds' jobs, about what names are associated with which Beloved - I want to know what stories get told about them, and how many Beloved there are.

Batman Beyond 

I only know Batman Beyond from the cartoon, so I'd prefer if you stuck closer to that, but I do understand it's a comic too, so if you want to throw in elements of that, feel free!

I like the feel of future Gotham, both neon and gritty.  It feels dangerous, half brightly lit and half shadow - it's desperation and wealth side by side.  Why is the city still such a mess?  What's gone wrong in the days since the first Batman, and how did the city react to his initial disappearance?

Part of the reason I enjoyed this series so much was the relationship between Terry and Bruce.  Bruce has more experience and he's the boss, and Terry respects that, but at the same time Terry is Batman and he ultimately goes his own way whenever he thinks it's necessary.  

I like Bruce.  He's a bitter old man who thinks he knows better than everyone else, and Terry coming into his life must have been like waking up again.  Terry is the only person we see on the show who ever stands up to him successfully, and it's good for a person to have an equal, even if that equal is actually in high school.  (Max and Barbara tried, during the course of the series, but neither of them quite pulled it off.  I'd love to see a story where they did, though.)

I really like Terry, too.  He's tough, and occasionally selfish, and deeply kind and generous.  He looks after his friends and his family and his city.  In some ways, I think Terry is better at being Batman than Bruce was, because he listens to other people and he lets them help him.  Terry also truly values his family and friends -  he cares more about work/life balance than Bruce did, which result in Terry trying to take better care of himself than Bruce used to.

Max is wonderful, too.  I love her friendship with Terry, and how even after she finds out about the whole Batman thing, she refuses to let herself be intimidated by either of them.  I'd like to see more of her relationship with her family, particularly her sister.  

Finally, I would have liked to see more of Dana in the cartoon.  I thought she was underutilized, which was a shame.  She seems to manage being compassionate but not a doormat well, and I think Terry is lucky to have her.  For a damsel in distress character type, she's actually pretty well rounded.  I'd love to see a story where Terry tells her the Batman secret of his own volition (although her finding out somehow, or figuring it out would be very cool, too).  

Prompt Ideas
I'd like to read: Bat investigations, maybe in the high school; Bruce and Terry fighting or working together like a well-honed machine or Bruce and Terry fighting <i>and</i> working together like a well-honed machine; Max and Terry being friends and covering for each other - maybe Terry can cover for Max, for once; Terry willingly telling his family or girlfriend that he's Batman; Max looking after Bruce even when he won't admit he needs it, even though it's harder than looking after Terry because at least Terry cooperates

Clue (1985) 

This is one of my favorite movies because it's utterly insane.  I love everything about it, from the wordplay and the acting to the bizarre characters and the merciless spoofing of mystery stories to the multiple endings and the impossibility of figuring out whodunnit.  

Idea Prompts
Are there any other ways it could have ended?  I would love to see some of versions where the people who didn't do it in the film did do it.  Or even where Mr. Boddy did it.  Or whoever else you can think of - there were a lot of crazy, amoral people in that house, and they probably had an even wider range of potentially murderous acquaintances.  Or maybe everyone in the film still did it, but they did different murders for different motives.

Or what happened after any of the possibly canon endings?  The FBI came and presumably everyone present had their cover blown in one way or another.  Some of the blackmail victims would be facing worse consequences than others, but all of them should be facing something.  Maybe it's as simple as two of the guests running into each other some day in the future, and they have to pretend they don't know each other.

Or are there any more murders after the end of the film?  I can't think of a reason why that group of people would gather together again, but if they ever did I'm almost certain there would be more dead bodies.

What if it was true that no one called the FBI, and they did quietly stack the bodies in the cellar?  Does everyone go on being blackmailed, just by someone new (or an old blackmailer in disguise)?  

Why does the house have all those odd passages?  Has it been the location of color-themed people with strangely specific weapons committing murders before or will it see these sorts of murders again?

Or tell me about the characters' histories!  Here are some things I'm curious about, but feel free to tell me something else entirely about any of them:
I want to know how Mrs. White kept finding men stupid enough to marry her, and why exactly her husband threatened to kill her in public.  How did she dispose of them all, anyway?
What about Colonel Mustard?  He seemed to be careless enough and immoral enough to have left all kinds of evidence of wrongdoing around - was he blackmailed by more than one person?
And Wadsworth and Mr. Boddy - in the ending where everyone did it, what was their relationship like?  What about their relationship when Wadsworth was FBI?  What was Wadsworth's relationship with his wife like?  Did he even have a wife?
Speaking of wives people may or may not have, what about Mr. Green's home life?  Does he have a family, or a boyfriend?  If he's not an FBI agent, what does he do in Washington?  If he is an FBI agent, how did he get inserted into the guest list for the evening?
What exactly does Mrs. Peacock sell, and to whom?  And how did Mrs. Peacock come to set up that particular payment plan?
There were negatives of at least one of Miss Scarlet's clients and employees in a compromising position.  Did she take those photos of all her clients?  Did she have a sideline in blackmail herself, when she isn't selling secrets, or does she instead take her clients' privacy very seriously because that's better for business?
Did Professor Plum's entry into the field of psychiatry rather than, say, surgery have anything to do with his inability to (most of the time) living people from dead ones?  Maybe he's had that kind of mix-up before.
Where is Yvette actually from?  How did she go from working for Miss Scarlet to Mr. Boddy?  Did it happen a different way in every different version?
What about the rest of the staff, and the rest of the victims?  What were their lives like before the dinner party?  What were their motivations for working for/with a guy like Mr. Boddy?

I know this movie is based on real life, but feel free to write as if it were pure fiction. No need to follow actual events and relationships here! Also Petra is an optional character. I don't mind if you can't work her into your fic.

If you feel up for it, I'd LOVE some glorious sexual debauchery in this fic. *eyebrow waggle*.

Or they chat about training and life in general over coffee in Petra's restaurant, and she joins in with some good advice. Perhaps a post-canon encounter? Maybe Eddie's truck breaks down on the circuit in Europe, and Matti's team help him and his sweet coach out. C: Or Matti could give training advice?

Mrs. Todd's Shortcut - Stephen King 
Ophelia Todd, Homer Buckland

How is it that Ophelia even manages to find those supernatural roads? Is it something about her personality? Or her car? Did she learn of it from her father, who taught her to use shortcuts? Or is it just that she keeps trying all those unknown logging roads and stumbles upon them? Do the roads appear on her map--perhaps AFTER she finds them? How are they depicted when they fold space? Why does she forget--or perhaps willfully ignore--the stranger aspects of her journey, like grabby trees and bizarre creatures? Is it because of a specific event? Would acknowledging something is weird make the roads no longer work, and she knows this from previous experience? What does her husband think of her shortcut obsession? Homer told David her husband \"didn't care piss-all\", but was that the truth? If not, why would Homer lie about it? How did he even know the husband's opinion? And then the really big one: just what happens with her and Homer after canon ends??? Perhaps you could tell me about their first adventure. Does Homer de-age and become some sort of wild fae ruler, like Ophelia? If they return to Castle Rock, what do David or the rest of the townsfolk think of their changed appearance and demeanor? I'm just full of all sorts of questions about this fandom! So many intriguing possibilities... 

Note: This story is in the 1985 Stephen King short story collection <i>Skeleton Crew</i>. Those of you know know Mr. King's works well will recognize this early foray into his <i>Dark Tower</i> series' todash space. It's been suggested that these are the same paths Father Callahan used to pass into the AU-America for <i>Wolves of the Calla</i>.

Natsume Yuujinchou | Natsume's Book of Friends 
Misuzu (Natsume Yuujinchou), Natsume Takashi, Nishimura Satoru, Shigure (Natsume Yuujinchou)

Misuzu is my favorite ayakashi in all of Natsume Yuujinchou! He's so honest, and his sense of honor is satisfying. Also I love his horse-cow-human design! I'd love a story where he and Natsume work together, or Natsume has to call his name for a daring rescue! Perhaps from Matoba's clutches? Or even a quiet moment with some touching dialogue between him and Natsume. Or you could go AU and have Misuzu ask for his name back, at last! What would cause him to want it returned? Could it be to protect Natsume? Can he change form, like Nyanko-sensei? (Perhaps turn into a pony-sized version of himself? Or take full human form??)

For Natsume Takashi himself, I admire how he's come to trust his friends over the many months of canon time. When he admitted he can see ayakashi to Tomura and Taki, I choked up. He's even opening up a little to his \"muggle\" friends Nishimura and Kitamoto, much to my delight. ^^ Natsume is so gentle and kind, trying to help ayakashi and having to learn the hard way that not all of them are good. (The opposite lesson he had to learn about humans: not all of them are cruel. Interesting.) I would love a fun ayakashi-centered adventure that could be canon. Or you could explore his friendships! I rather like his odd relationship with the guy from one of his foster families, Shibata Katsumi--the playboy in love with the dying flower youkai. I didn't have enough character slots to nominate him, but I would enjoy more interaction between him and Natsume! (And feel free to slash it up. *eyebrow waggle*) If you're feeling ambitious, you could do a future AU with grown!Natsume still returning names and trying to help ayakashi. Or perhaps Natsume could travel to Tokyo and deal with a city ayakashi and exorcists? Just how would <i>that</i> go? 

Nishimura Satoru. I admit, when it comes to this guy, I'm pretty shallow! XD He's so obsessed with girls, and he expresses so much dismay whenever he thinks Natsume might have a girlfriend. The slasher in me can't help but see that he has a <i>massive</i> crush on our beautiful and ethereal Takashi. Nishimura is chasing skirts as overcompensation, and his dismay over the girlfriends is jealousy--of the women! X3 Nishimura is so outgoing and bouncy, what could make him keep quiet about his attraction? How would Natsume react if Nishimura did express that interest? Natsume seems rather indifferent to romance so far, would that continue? Or how about a quiet pre-slash moment between the two, with Nishimura just so happy to have some quality time alone with his true love? ^^ I realize this is very much a rare pair, so Nishimura is an \"OR\" character request. If you can't fit him into your story, I don't mind. C:

Shigure and Jun's chapter in the 2nd volume of the manga really touched me--particularly since Jun really does move away at the end!! *sniffles* Please write about their next meeting! Does Shigure seek Jun out in her new town? Does Jun return as an adult to find Shigure and help him? Can they only see each other in dreams? Can Jun see other ayakashi--and how does that affect her life and their relationship? More please of this pair! *wistful sigh* Shigure is also an \"OR\" request.

I'm currently half way through series 3, and expect to be much further on before reveals, but I'd prefer it if there weren't any references to series 4 cases.

Anything in the run up to Christmas would be great - planning, a case taking over, a specific festive case.  Or anything else which inspires you.

Anything would be great! I'm totally okay with gen and romance, and any rating is fine. I like a wide variety of stories, including humour, romance, action/adventure, character study, slice of life and exploration of robots, AI, consciousness and identities. If you want a prompt, though, it would be awesome if you would like to explore the metatextual aspect of the game (Robot realizing that that it's a game character! Robot meeting other version of itself!, etc) or tell me more stories about the Robot: its typical day, its relationship with other humans and robots, stories from its perspective look like? No death fic please.

Choice of Robots is a text adventure that has extensive breadth of freedom, exploration of robots and AI and very good writing. It is is available on Android, IOS and Steam. You can play the first two chapters free: https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/

The Gramadevi's Lament - Sunil Patel 
Pooja's female descendant (The Gramadevi's Lament)

I really love how beautifully written, touching and creepy the story is, and I find Tuldaramma's love of her mortal worshipper Pooja is both touching and scary, as she destroys everyone in the vvillage when Pooja marries into other villages (thus forever lost to her). I would really want to know what's happened as  Pooja's female descendent knows about her story and has (unknowingly?) just become Tuldaramma's. 

Any rating is fine. I like both gen and Pooja's female descendant/Tuldaramma. I like stories without sex, stories with sex and porn. It's totally all right if you go dark and creepy, exploring psychological horror and manipulation powerdifference, but if if you want to write quiet slice of life, hurt/comfort or fluff, it's all right too.

If you want more prompts though, I would like to know more about Pooja's female descendant. Why does she return to this abandoned village? What does she think about Pooja and Tuldaramma before and after knowing about their stories? What's her response to now being Tuldaramma's?

Hunter: the Reckoning 

I really love the game’s deconstruction of \"monster hunters with a higher calling.\" The grey and grey morality, the clash of views on what to do with the supernatural creatures and the potential for psychological and body horror and would like to see more.

Prompt:

&nbsp;

    Monster Hunting: How do the characters deal with the stress of monster hunting and what motivates them to continue? What kind of price they need to pay, what kind of horror/adventure they encounter and what obstacles they have to overcome? I like all factions in the core book equally and a story that people with different ideals having to work together is great. or a story that they interact (maybe over the Internet).

    I find the concept of Hunter.net interesting. What kind of rumours spread over the forum? What kind of wank/famous events happen across the years? What kind of (mis)information is spread across there? Does any supernatural creature try to infiltrate the hunter.net and what’s happened afterwards? Who are the regulars and what do they think of each other?

&nbsp;
Horror: I love moral ambiguities, no win scenarios, secrets, lies and shames, psychological messes and a glimpse into the void. I also love when characters are transformed psychologically or physically against their will, characters who can't figure out what's real or not. However, I prefer the stories to end with a hint of hope rather than complete despair. If you want more prompts:
- Characters are on the run, having to survive  when those they love and trust don't trust them anymore
- Characters have nightmares that begin to bleed into the waking world.
- Betrayal and unexpected revealation

Note: I don't mind major character death in this fandom, but I will prefer no graphic description of their death.

Memoirs of a Geisha - Arthur Golden 
Nitta Sayuri (Memoirs of a Geisha - Arthur Golden), Nobu Toshikazu (Memoirs of a Geisha - Arthur Golden)

See letter for general likes and dislikes.

&nbsp;

I’m never going to stop requesting fic for these two. The film overlooks it somewhat but their interactions in the novel were my main source of delight, the curious balance of bickering and respect. Neither character knows much kindness in their life; I like to think they’d find that in each other, sort of kindred spirits.

I’ve requested Sayuri and Nobu because I’d love more of that relationship in any form. That might be Sayuri appreciating Nobu platonically, or even a full romantic relationship (danna AU?), or choosing or accepting Nobu over the Chairman (post-canon AU?) – or not (how does Nobu feel? Angst!) Anything with a focus on the relationship between these two will fill me with glee – as I said before it doesn’t need to have a happy ending, I just want more.

For bonus points, this relationship raises all kinds of issues worth exploring: the value of Sayuri’s ability to make her own choices; the restrictions placed on her by her culture, both within the hanamachi and broader Japanese culture; the way Sayuri pins her life’s ambitions to the idea of the Chairman; the physicality of Nobu, in his eyes and Sayuri’s; the circumstances of Nobu and the Chairman, with the former unattached and interested and the latter married and, to Sayuri, distant and unreachable; not to mention the incongruity of mixing notions of Western romance with another culture. An attachment to Nobu casts all these issues in a different light compared to Sayuri’s attachment to the Chairman. There are many reasons why he might be a better choice – and an active choice too, while she’s been on a trajectory towards the Chairman for many, many years without truly questioning it. Perhaps you might show Sayuri changing, growing like she did in the novel, or maybe you could show the wit, kindness and grudging mutual respect when they interact. Don’t be afraid though, I just want these two to be vaguely affectionate towards one another, even gruffly or distractedly – they both need and deserve it. All the rest is a bonus.

The Godfather (1972 1974 1990) 
Apollonia Vitelli Corleone

See letter for general likes and dislikes.

&nbsp;

Last year, I was lucky enough to see The Godfather on the big screen accompanied by a live orchestra and it brought back all the feelings I had when I first read the novel and saw the films as a teenager. In particular, I found myself wondering about Apollonia. We see her entirely through Michael’s eyes and I was left wondering who this woman was and how she had changed during those months. Had she changed at all, or simply lost her shyness? How she would have changed more if she’d lived?

I wonder about her relationship with Michael. Did she love him? Why? What did she think of him, and their situation, and what she was getting herself into? Was she aware of it? Why did she marry him, and what did she think her future might look like?

I wonder about the relationship she might have had with her new family. What would Mama Corleone have thought of her new daughter-in-law? What if Apollonia had lived, and they’d returned to New York, and she’d lived in the compound? What place would she find in that family, in that life, in that country?

What were her hopes, her ambitions? Every girl has them – what were hers? Did they change as her situation changed, did she see a way up or a way out or was she on the path she wanted all along?

In short, I have a lot of questions about Apollonia. For all that I’ve phrased this as a series of questions about her, it would be just as interesting to read a fic from the perspective of another character contemplating or observing her – I would just love to fill in the Apollonia-shaped blank space in my imagination.

The Loneliest Girl in the Universe - Lauren James 
Romy Silvers

See letter for general likes and dislikes.

&nbsp;

I need to know what happens next.

I devoured this novel in only three or four hours a few days after its release, and it was so much more than I was expecting. It lurched between genres in a way that delighted me and the tension in the second half was magnificient. I spotted the clues in the paratexts far enough in advance to be truly uneasy without quite being able to put my finger on why.

Romy must have such great obstacles to overcome concerning trust, intimacy, physical contact and relationships with other human beings. I would love to see some of the fallout from the climax of the novel. For example, what, if any, relationship does she develop with Isaac? Does she get back in touch with Molly and tell her what happened? How does Molly respond, and when? In fact, would you like to tell Molly’s side of the story? Does Romy keep writing fic to process her experiences as she forms her first proper adult relationships?

I will be truly delighted with any story in this fandom, I can’t even tell you.

Tell me more about Joanna finally telling Mary Carlson the truth at the end. Tell me more about the time between when they get together and their road trip! Tell me more about their road trip!

One Day at a Time (TV 2017) 
Elena Alvarez

One Day at a Time is such a delight and I love Elena so much, therefore I would love any story centered around her. Some ideas: How does everything that happened at her Quinces, good and bad, affect her? What is the aftermath of that? Or, if you feel like writing a story about her and Carmen as friends (or more, if you're so inclined), that would be great. Otherwise, a different first date/first love story? If you'd rather write future fic, does she end up changing the world? Most of all, I want Elena to be happy and loved. For more prompts and more on why I love her, see my letter.

Schitt's Creek (TV) 
David Rose, Patrick (Schitt's Creek), Stevie Budd

This is really an either-or request that David is the most important part of. I love this show SO MUCH and I fell head over heels for David and Patrick in season three. I adore David and Stevie's friendship, though. With that said, here are some prompts of things I'd love to see:
If you want to write something for David and Patrick (such as, second date, dating and running the store together, the first time they have sex, or some shenanigans they get up to in Schitt's Creek), cool, that would be amazing.
That all said, I also love Stevie and I love in particular the way Stevie and Patrick clicked immediately in having someone to tease David with. I am still a little upset that the show teased poly at the beginning of S3 (albeit with a different third) and it didn't happen, so if your heart is in it, any kind of poly situation for these three instead would be phenomenal, too, but it is definitely not required or expected.
I also adore the episode where David and Stevie have their sleepover and I just love to see them bonding as friends. More of that would always be muchly appreciated. For more details and more prompts, see my letter!

Tell Me Three Things - Julie Buxbaum 
Jessie Holmes, Ethan Marks

I love this book so much! Secret ID romances are my kryptonite and this was a great one. Some prompts for this request: My only complaint about the book is that I feel like we didn't get enough of their in-person relationship after they spent the entire book emailing. How did their relationship online translate into the offline realm beyond the three hours? Or if you could tell me more about their first meetup and what they actually talked about for three hours, that would be great, too!
I would also love epistolary fic in which they continue emailing each other with three things and to see them shamelessly flirt with each other on IM/through email. For more details and more prompts, see my letter!

Geralt z Rivii | Geralt of Rivia (Witcher Games), Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (Witcher Games), Emhyr var Emreis (Witcher Games)

Ciri is the Empress of my heart! I'd love to see a fic with Ciri having to deal with politics as the newly crowned Empress of Nilfgaard - anything from assassins and attempts to dethrone her, to sleeping her way through the female Nilfgaardian aristocracy and most of the palace maidservants while avoiding people trying to marry her to Movran Voorhis. I'd also like to see a fic where Emhyr joins Geralt after Ciri ascends the throne and they go on a Nilfgaardian Monster Road Trip - bonus points if they end up fucking, extra bonus points if they fuck in progressively more disgusting places until they reach their destination.

I prefer Ciri as a lesbian but ODAO

(I blanked and forgot to nominate Katherine Brooke, who also seems to have had a formative crush, and my intended request was for something where they meet later and bond over how important Anne was to them [f/f if your heart tends that way] That would be awesome too but since she's not in the tagset, no worries if it's not what you want to write.)

Suradanna and the Sea - Rebecca Fraimow 

I was absolutely in love with this novella from the moment I first read it and although it ends on the perfect note, when I finished reading it I WANTED MORE. So I have turned to yuletide! Really I would be delighted by any fic about anything at all to do with the story, but here are some possible prompts:

- What's going on for the captain during the vast swathes of the story when she's not interacting with Suradanna? Does she have any interesting adventures? Does she think about Suradanna anywhere near as much as Suradanna thinks about her?

- The captain's backstory! What was she like as a young person? How did she react to the initial discovery that she's immortal? Has she always been this unwilling to truly get engaged in the lives of other people? Has she been in love before?

- Outsider pov on one of Suradanna's many personas, or on what it's like to be a sailor on the Dolphin Breathes Fire, or the whole zuiran catastrophe, etc

- What happens after the end of the story? Plot/worldbuilding-wise and relationship-wise, either directly after or continuing to go a bunch further into the future

- Suradanna and the captain in space! Why not, there can totally be development of space travel eventually in their immortal lifespans

- Suradanna and/or the captain accidentally drinking waters that do other exciting and not-necessarily-desirable magical things! For example how horrified would the captain be to develop telepathy between her and Suradanna, especially in the earlier days when the captain's doing her best to pretend Suradanna doesn't exist

I COULD KEEP GOING but I'll leave it there, you get the idea, go wild, I want ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING from fic for this nonexistent fandom.

Oh, I suppose I should also mention something about how I see the captain and Suradanna's relationship. I definitely ship them! Like, they are canonically each other's Most Important Person by the end of the story, seeing each other as anchors in an ever-changing world, and to me the strength of their emotional connection is the most important aspect of their relationship. LOVE IT. I don't really care who they do or do not have sex with, and I'm fine with them caring about other people as well, but I adore the centrality of their importance to each other so I'd love for that to be present if you choose to write a fic that includes both of them. (....I also like the captain's relationship with her boat, for the record. Poor doomed Dolphin Breathes Fire.)

The Raven and the Reindeer - T. Kingfisher 
Gerta (The Raven and the Reindeer), Janna (The Raven and the Reindeer)

I love this book so much, it feels like a gift just for me of exactly what I would want out of a Snow Queen retelling, and I can't believe it exists in the world.

I love that the book ends with affirming the Gerta/Janna relationship (AWW YEAH I SHIP THEM SO MUCH) but I want more of what happens after that ending!

I would love to see more about Gerta actually reintegrating into her community at the end of the book (being part of a herd!!) - her reunion with her grandmother and introducing Janna to her grandmother, but also whether/how she makes connections with the rest of her community now that she's not myopically focused on Kay like she was when she was last home.

How does it go for Janna to join this community where she's a stranger, especially since she's used to such a different life? Is she happy there or is she restless? How is Gerta's &amp; Janna's relationship affected by being finished their quest?

Obviously the two go on their trip to the coast, but do they do other travelling/adventuring as well? Do they settle for good in Gerta's home community, or just come back to visit it occasionally? What kind of life do the two of them have together?

Apparently all the prompt-like ideas I'm coming up with are for things post-canon, whoops, but that's by no means the only things I'm interested in reading, so go ahead and do something completely different too if you want!

The Princess Curse - Merrie Haskell 

Pretty much Reveka and Lord Dragos are SO AMAZING and SO INTERESTING and I WANT ALL THE FANFICTION about either or both of them. Lord Dragos backstory from pre-king-of-the-underworld days? Lord Dragos backstory about him becoming lord of the underworld and being new and awkward and not knowing everything and trying and failing and all that? Reveka growing further into her role as queen of the underworld? Reveka and Dragos learning to know each other better over the years? A fic about Reveka and Dragos politicking in the underworld???

Although actually I'm also just into this book (and its worldbuilding!) in general so don't necessarily feel bound by the characters in the tagset. I would also be interested in fic like, for example: more about the functioning of the underworld, Alethe’s nymph’s backstory, fic about whatever’s up with Reveka’s handmaid Thela. And so on! SO MANY OPTIONS and I would love any of them, including things I haven't mentioned here!

Please note that I'm less interested in reading a story that's mainly focused on a romantic relationship (or development thereof) between Reveka/Dragos, although a romance between them could certainly be an aspect in a story about other things if you want. I'd also be fine with their relationship staying platonic.

Carrie - Stephen King 
Carrie White, Susan Snell

Carrie is hateful, spiteful, funny, immensely powerful, sadistic, pathetic, dangerous, sweet... just a really amazing character. I would say the same for Sue Snell. She's more than a pretty girl with a conscience. More than that one moment in the locker-room where she did something she could never take back no matter how hard she tried. I really wish they'd shared more moments. A conversation, a look, a thought, anything. I love how the book is set-up in the aftermath of the incident and that the town's destruction is covered widely by the media and argued about at academic levels. I also like that the use of Carrie's powers has a real effect on her body and mind. Going deeper into either of those things or showing their effects on a Carrie and Sue that lives in the end would be amazing. Feel free to go wild with the mindfuckery, gaslighting, coercion... all those beautiful and dark things Carrie is particularly suited to.

There's a tug-of-war inside of me on whether or not I believe they could survive as a couple.

This is truly one of the funniest, strangely violent, surprisingly sweet and thoughtful comedic takes on the super spy genre ever made. Susan Cooper may not be what you'd imagine when picturing an ultra-competent CIA agent, but that's part of what makes her so special. Rayna Boyanov might be exactly what you imagine when trying to picture a spoiled, criminal underworld princess, but there's more to her than meets the eye. I love Aldo. He saw how beautiful and sexy and competent Susan was before she believed it herself and he gets zero love. Sure, he's weird and slimy and sleazy and maybe Italian but probably English but there ain't nothing wrong with that. I really enjoyed the understanding these people were able to come to by the end of the movie and that they even liked each other. There's no need to include all three characters, pick two if you prefer. I just want to see more of them.

My perennial request! I'm a sucker for a well-made, romantic period piece with a strong female lead (at least that's what Netflix tells me) and this delivers in spades.  I absolutely adore the 1996 miniseries. The very insular period setting, the class issues such a union would bring bubbling to the surface, the angst between Helen and Gilbert themselves over her wealth and station and his lack of either.  Their chemistry, the way she handles the nosy towns people, the way he courts her, her strength, the love between her and her brother, Gilbert's willingness to go beat up said brother when he mistakenly felt the man was mistreating her (and also because he was just jealous). Sigh. Anything post-movie (their wedding, making babies, slice of life stuff, etc.) would be wonderful. FYI, I have read and love the novel so feel free to pull from that source as well if you'd like.

深夜食堂 | Shinya Shokudo | Midnight Diner (TV) 
Kosuzu (Shinya Shokudō), Master (Shinya Shokudō), Ryu Kenzaki (Shinya Shokudo)

To me, their friendship is so pure and precious. I will love anything that explores their friendship further. Like... does Ryu-chan ever visited Kosuzu-san's bar, what does he do there? Or has Kosuzu-san been able to help Ryu-chan with some complicated work-related problem?

But it doesn't even have to be work related. Even non-work related things, every day life things big and small, or pedestrian situations that they somehow find themselves helping each other. Or just some gentle slice of life thing that may not even mean anything at all.

What if they suddenly have the same day off work? Where would they go? What would they do? What season will that day off be in? 

Or have they fallen out? Perhaps some misunderstanding or a problem that has arisen out of their line of work? And how does Master figure in all of this? Can he help them patch up before its too late? 

Basically anything with a happy ending about these two will definitely be gold to me!

Henshin Dekinai (Manga) 
Someya Kaoru, Honda Soichiro

I would love to be able to read more about what happened after the manga finishes. Will Honda finally prevail over the last hurdle in the \"race\" to the altar? Will Someya's father finally accept Honda wholeheartedly as his son-in-law? What happens when Someya's father try to atone for decades of distance and finally be Dad (will be interesting to get a take on why he raised his son the way he did? he seemed to be a doting father who is even rather \"mommish\"). 

What about Someya's career as Mama? How does Someya juggle between his personal and professional life? What sort of problems does he run across as a shop owner, and how does he use his intellect and charm to solve these problems? I really love reading stories about people working and generally being the best at what they do. 

Speaking of careers, would also love to read about Honda juggling garage business, love, and racing. And more importantly, how have his exceptional people skills made him some formidable friends? A story about how people keep underestimating him and he keeps exceeding their expectations regarding business is great, too. I think he is that kind of boss that takes his people's welfare to heart. So to pay them well and keep them happy and running a successful business... he can't be that bad of a yankee, no?

I love that these two individually capable come together and make fireworks sparks fly. But if you have any other ideas, please ignore the prompts :) Basically anything about these two, with these two in center stage, I will treasure greatly!

决对争锋 | Jué duì zhēng fēng | Beloved Enemy (Web Series) 
Yuan Yang, Gu Qing Pei, Peng Fang

At the end of the series Yuan Yang and Gu Qing Pei are driving to their proverbial sunset--i.e. the start of their new venture (or as Yuan Yang called it in the novel \"our mom-and-pop store\" (lol)). Did they take up Xie Yan's offer of an investment? 

Certainly we see that in the end Executive Yuan has come to accept his son's choices (he is his son after all), but has Executive Yuan forgiven Gu Qing Pei? Also, what about Yuan Yang's birth mother? What does she think about all of this. If you decide to go on the non-gen relationship route, I'd be interested to learn more about this family angle. 

Even though this is based on a BL novel, the series is bromance at best. So, even though I dearly wish they would do a BL version of the web series, if you're only comfortable writing gen it's okay also.

Or if you want to write a het-story, what about Peng Fang and Wang Ran? There's also hints at the last episode about a blossoming wink-wink-nudge-nudge between these two interesting characters. Will they act on it? Will Wang Jin blow a gasket over his younger sister dating? Will Wang Jin be friendzoned forever? What will Yuan Yang and Gu Qing Pei do (I imagine them cheering their friends along). 

If you choose to write about Peng Fang and Wang Ran (or a triangle love story between Peng Fang and Wang Siblings lol...) I actually don't mind Yuan Yang and Gu Qing Pei being secondary characters, lol, as long as they're there together (they're my OTP) in some shape or form.

I really love Alex and PJ's relationship – they seem like such an odd couple who really love and understand each other. I love how smart Alex is and I love how funny PJ finds him. I love Alex's frustrations with the world and how endearing PJ finds it. I love how prickly Alex thinks he is and how PJ knows better. I love how PJ is actually the softer of the two.

They both think Lovett's the funniest guy ever, and the affection they have for him is heart-warming. I'd read threesome fic for days, but would be ecstatic with either a Lovett/Favs or a Lovett/Tommy fic. Although, honestly, I'd read the shit out of a Favs/Tommy fic, too.

Alien: Covenant 
Daniels (Alien: Covenant), Walter (Alien: Covenant)

I'd like fixit fic for the ending. ;_____; I shipped Daniels/Walter really hard while watching this because I loved the slow build of loyalty and attention each paid the other, and I would basically love to see how they could have a happily ever after or gotten together in a different scenario. I would love domesticity and Walter doing things for Daniels to show his love~ including, like, killing people on her behalf or making her her favourite food on her birthday. Any kind of AU you could think of would probably be great, too, so long as you kept the general relationship dynamics the same.

I would find either POV equally indulgent, but if you didn't want to write too far into the future, something on from Walters' POV on falling in love with Davis would be super romantic. ;____; I was so happy when I realized partway through the movie that Walter's subtle thing for her wasn't just me reading subtext in nothing. THEY WERE SO CUTE. Ahem.

If you're not into complete canon divergent AUs, I don't need everything to be super perfectly happy, but I'd like it if Walter managed to survive, get on the ship and live out a life with Daniels untouched by the general ravaging the aliens are going to do on the new world. Like, them building a wood cabin in a remote, unaccessible place and not seeing other people? Great.

Sprig Muslin - Georgette Heyer 
Gareth Ludlow

I loved the way Amanda and Hildebrand sort of accidentally became Gareth's niece and nephew and quickly came to impose on him and one another. Their bantering and seeking approval from Gareth was great.

How does their pseudo-family relationship come up in the future? Does Gareth have to (fondly) endure random callings on from them in London? Do they send letters asking for life advice or complaining about one another? Do they meet his actual blood relatives? How do other people react to seeing them be so familiar with Gareth/one another?

Feel free to include side characters! I really enjoyed Amanda's fiancee, Hester and Amanda's grandfather.

Sungkyunkwan Scandal 
Moon Jae Shin, Gu Yong Ha

I love how these two are super loyal friends despite the socioeconomic + political divide &lt;333 they believe in one another no matter what and it's adooorbs.

I feel like throughout the show there were a bunch of points where Gu Yong Ha was worried sick about Moon Jae Shin and Moon Jae Shin was all, \"nbd,\" leaving Gu Yong Ha in distress. With that in mind, I'd love a story where Gu Yong Ha gets into some kind of danger or situation where Moon Jae Shin has to worry about him and ~realizes ~his feelings. Or maybe something where Gu Yong Ha is (pretending to?) date someone elseand Jae Shin is jealous or Moon Jae Shin realizes he's been taking Gu Yong Ha for granted or something that incorporates Gu Yong Ha having a bad day and then feeling better when he's around Moon Jae Shin. &lt;3 Hurt/comfort would be very appreciated, as would be Gu Yong Ha whump, provided there's ample comfort afterwards.

I'm fine with canon-divergent AUs (or any sort of AU that takes place in the same time period, like one of them being a different class or being a male gisaeng or smth) or the OT4 friendship :3

Fallout 3 
Amata Almodovar (Fallout 3), Lone Wanderer (Fallout 3), Star Paladin Cross (Fallout 3), Sarah Lyons (Fallout 3)

DNWs: rape/non-con, sex involving characters under 18, sexual possessiveness or jealousy as a kink (eg \"You're mine and no one else can have you\"), graphic depictions of torture (other types of injury/scarification/etc. are OK), formal/lifestype BDSM, A/B/O &amp; heats/soulmate AUs/anything else along the lines of \"destiny/fantasy biology/magic overrides characters' agency wrt romance/sex\", genderswap/rule 63, unrequested setting change AUs or crossovers (canon divergence AUs are always OK), unrequested downer endings, non-canonical character death, asexuality headcanons, first person POV (unless stated).

As I've requested four characters for this fandom, please don't feel obligated to include them all in your story. If it works, great! But feel free to choose whatever combination makes the most sense. I'm really up for femslash between any of these characters, and if you go in a shippy direction with them, I'd prefer the Lone Wanderer be female. I'd also prefer if the LW has neutral or good karma. Naming the Lone Wanderer if you choose to write about them is welcome!

- AU where the Overseer kicks Amata out of the vault for helping the LW escape, and they go through the trials and tribulations of the main quest together--especially if there's still mistrust and complicated feelings between them like in the actual game. Or maybe Amata leaves with the LW because she doesn't believe the LW is strong enough to take care of themselves out in the Wastes. The degree to which she's proven wrong in this evaluation is up to you.
- Several years in the future after the game's conclusion, when the Lone Wanderer has faded into obscurity/settled down in Megaton/etc, Amata has to reach out to the LW once again because (reasons). Now that they're both real adults, instead of teens forced into positions of leadership too soon, maybe her perspective has changed and there are opportunities for reconciliation? It'd be especially interesting to read something that doesn't gloss over how difficult that would be for both of them. All of the resentment and envy and residual deep affectionate feelings, please.
- Amata cares about protecting people and maintaining order for the greater good. I could see her getting along well with either Sarah or Paladin Cross, and I'd love to see your take on interactions between them.
- Mentor/mentee dynamics within the Brotherhood (Paladin Cross-Sarah, or between either of them and the Lone Wanderer)?
- A star-struck Lone Wanderer nursing a giant crush on either one of these powerful military women, especially before winning Sarah's respect.
- I'd love to read something that looks at Paladin Cross' experiences with her cyborg body. She doesn't eat or sleep anymore--what's that like?
- What are Sarah and Cross' daily interactions at Brotherhood high command like? Have they served together in the line of duty? I'd love to read some pre-FO3 mission fic involving daring feats of bravery and intense ~battle feelings~.
- Something bouncing off of Sarah's comment in Broken Steel about wanting to get to know the LW better. I'm not sure what the dating life of a Brotherhood Elder would look like, but something where she's trying to fit some romance in with all of her duties running a military organization in the post-apocalypse would be so fun to read.
- Maybe Paladin Cross comforts the LW after the death of James? Especially if it's a sort of stoic, knightly, unspoken comfort. Alternately, maybe the LW is into Paladin Cross but Cross doesn't think it's appropriate because of the age difference/her being a cyborg/etc and so there is a lot of repression and guilty feelings and sublimation into Duty and Service.
- Fix-it fic where Sarah doesn't die, Maxson doesn't get to take over the East Coast BoS, and the ripple effects of that in terms of what the plot of Fallout 4 might look like? Paladin Cross was the advisor to Sarah's father, so something about her time as Sarah's second in command would also be really interesting.
- I could go on, but basically: warrior women/women in command positions doing cool things and/or having Feelings. Post-apocalyptic day-to-day life. Canon divergence AUs. These are all things that I love.

Marathon (Video Games) 
Durandal (Marathon), Security Officer (Marathon)

DNWs: rape/non-con, sex involving characters under 18, sexual possessiveness or jealousy as a kink (eg \"You're mine and no one else can have you\"), graphic depictions of torture (other types of injury/scarification/etc. are OK), formal/lifestype BDSM, A/B/O &amp; heats/soulmate AUs/anything else along the lines of \"destiny/fantasy biology/magic overrides characters' agency wrt romance/sex\", genderswap/rule 63, unrequested setting change AUs or crossovers (canon divergence AUs are always OK), unrequested downer endings, non-canonical character death, asexuality headcanons, first person POV (unless stated).

I'd prefer a male or nonbinary Security Officer if you want to get shippy, but would love to see a female Security Officer who still has a thorny yet loyalty-laden platonic (or ambiguous) relationship with Durandal.

- I’d love anything that reflects on Durandal and the Security Officer’s relationships to their shared human origins and mutual quasi-immortality. I would love to see some of the interiority of a cyborg space marine in their day-to-day life, or something that plays with what it means to be an AI consciousness instead of an organic being--I never get bored of this kind of thing.
- I love the idea that the Security Officer is just mildly bemused by all of the wackiness that goes on around them, but maybe they're totally freaking out the whole time? Either direction is intriguing. I would love to see someone do something where the Security Officer can actually respond to all of Durandal's nonsense. Terminal banter!! (Terminal flirting??) On the other hand, I also love the idea of the Security Officer as an actual silent protagonist, if you want to run with that. Basically, what is going on in the Security Officer's head?
- Relatedly, why exactly is the Security Officer so amenable to being Durandal's willing minion? I just really love loyalty kink, and this canon has it in spades. So yeah. Have at it.
- There have been so many amazing explorations of Durandal's interiority, but I'm always in search of even more, because I absolutely love him as a character in ways that are hard to articulate properly. Does he write the terminal entries for his own sake? What is the interior monologue of a rampant AI? I'm also intrigued by the theories that hold that Durandal was actually able to achieve metastability at some point in M2 or M:I, but was lying about it Because Reasons, so if you wanted to take that possibility and run with it I'm very curious to see where you could end up.
- What would happen if the Security Officer got woken out of cryosis early because of the ship crash landing somewhere/some kind of malfunction (possibly resulting in Deep Space Hijinks)? Or what if they weren't put in cryosis for those seventeen years of transit in the first place? To be a fly on the wall of that ship...
- Or, give me all the really silly tropey sci-fi/space opera crack played straight. Getting into some situation where you gotta marry your AI because of wacky alien customs?? Flimsy sci-fi excuse for bodysharing, with Durandal having to be uploaded into some cyborgian chip in the Security Officer's cortex Because Reasons??? Or maybe some kind of scenario where the Security Officer has to pilot some kind of giant robot in the fight against the Pfhor, with Durandal as the thing's AI (leading to some Evangelion/Pacific Rim-esq mech-suit mindmelding with optional body horror??). I love sci-fi tropes and there's so much fun you can have thinking about the ways a technologically advanced super-soldier and a rampant AI could end up interacting.

The Sisters Brothers - Patrick deWitt 
Charlie Sisters, Eli Sisters

DNWs: rape/non-con, sex involving characters under 18, sexual possessiveness or jealousy as a kink (eg \"You're mine and no one else can have you\"), graphic depictions of torture (other types of injury/scarification/etc. are OK), formal/lifestype BDSM, A/B/O &amp; heats/soulmate AUs/anything else along the lines of \"destiny/fantasy biology/magic overrides characters' agency wrt romance/sex\", genderswap/rule 63, unrequested setting change AUs or crossovers (canon divergence AUs are always OK), unrequested downer endings, non-canonical character death, asexuality headcanons, first person POV (unless stated).

Feel free to ignore my DNW for First Person POV for this fandom, since Eli's narration is such a key part of the book, and I'm more than open to reading any attempts to replicate it.

- I'm very open to incest fic if you want to write it. I'm also into just getting more of what we got in canon: bickering brother-coworkers who are each other's only source of familiarity, stability, and emotional intimacy even as their actual relationship is fraught with resentment, manipulation, and long-held grudges. Like always, my favourite thing to read is moments of familiarity and even tenderness between violent and terrible characters. Don't shy away from how fucked up their relationship is, but I think it's also important to take into account some of the lightness and ease to it, as well, since the tension between those two tones is part of what makes the book work, IMO.
- I want pre-canon murder hijinks like burning. Casefic about past jobs? Snapshots of their early life, when they were just getting started as killers? Their first brush with the Commodore, and how they got themselves hired?
- I love the Pacific Northwest gothic/magical realist elements of the story, like the cabin witch's \"curse\" and the creepy intermission with the girl and the dog. I'd love to see a writer do something with that: not so much try to \"explain\" it, because I think part of the charm is how inexplicable and bizarre those episodes are, but run with it within your piece. Or write, like, some kind of magic AU where these are cowboy hitmen with witchy powers or something. Really just go for it, I will read anything.
- What happens after that ending? Does Charlie ever become more like his old self again, and does his personality change for better or for worse? Does Eli get to open up his store? How does Eli fare as the brother-in-charge, at last? Does anyone ever find them out for bumping off the Commodore? How do things go with their mother?
- Feel free to do some funky things with formatting/formal characteristics, if the mood strikes you, since the book has all those weird intermissions, font changes, and lapses into journal-writing and monologues from other characters. If you feel like writing some epistolary or even weird neo-Western IF, go for it.

Utopia (TV 2013) 
Milner (Utopia), The Assistant (Utopia)

DNWs: rape/non-con, sex involving characters under 18, sexual possessiveness or jealousy as a kink (eg \"You're mine and no one else can have you\"), graphic depictions of torture (other types of injury/scarification/etc. are OK), formal/lifestype BDSM, A/B/O &amp; heats/soulmate AUs/anything else along the lines of \"destiny/fantasy biology/magic overrides characters' agency wrt romance/sex\", genderswap/rule 63, unrequested setting change AUs or crossovers (canon divergence AUs are always OK), unrequested downer endings, non-canonical character death, asexuality headcanons, first person POV (unless stated).

- I love Utopia so much. In general, if you're wondering what you could create that I'd enjoy, anything that feels like an outtake or coda from 2.01 is the definition of \"up my alley\". Utopia Season 2, Episode 1 is my alley.
- The contrast between Carvel and the Assistant in terms of the roles they play in Milner’s life fascinates me—Carvel is this godlike figure she’s in love with but also keeping captive, in certain senses, and for all their deep emotional connection they also fear and distrust each other, whereas the Assistant is this mundane, almost invisible presence who nonetheless occupies a space of closeness and intimacy in Milner’s life that almost exceeds Carvel’s. He has keys to her house! He’s the only one we hear call her “Letan”! I need the Milner-Assistant origin story like burning. How did they meet? What were they to each other before Carvel and Janus and “your loyalty breaks my heart”?
- Milner is one of my favourite characters of all time and I sorely need more of her, in whatever way! Was she telling the truth about having been in a genocide, and if so, in what capacity? For his part, how did the Assistant lose his name? Who was he? What do people like Tom think his deal is? (Seriously, do people just think Milner has this gangling male secretary that follows her around in three-piece suits, or something?)
- Mission-fic!!! Either before or during the Janus era. Cold war spy hijinks! Undercover as lovers while attending some ballroom dance function in order to steal state secrets! Threatening bureaucrats in the back rooms of supper clubs! You know, all the minutia of leading a shadowy biowarfare conspiracy while also being normal spies on the side.
- More of their weirdly domestic and familiar brand of co-villaining, in general. I love coworkers, and I extra love coworkers in secretive cultlike organizations.
- Explicitly shippy or not is fine, I just want something like the ambiguous mastermind-and-devoted-right-hand dynamic we get in canon. I absolutely eat up all the worshipfulness, identity fuckery, canonical scarification, and everything else that's going on here.

John Connor (Terminator 1984-2009), Kate Brewster (Terminator 1984-2009), Sarah Connor (Terminator 1984-2009), Kyle Reese (Terminator 1984-2009)

I love the time-travel mindfuckery of this franchise, and the ways that the shifting timelines affect each other in ways large and small. Show me a new one, or several! Kyle arrives too early in the original timeline? Sarah gives birth to a girl, or never has a kid at all? John survives the war alone, or Kate does? I’m game. Want to bring in minor characters like the Salceda family or the Salvation crew? Do it. Derek Reese or Weaver lady cameos? Mix up those timelines! Kate Brewster kicking ass independently? Use all the characters, or not—I’m just so excited about new twists for any of them.

But I finally watched T3 recently, and while it wasn't exactly a great movie, it did leave me wondering specifically about John and Kate's relationship. What do they get up to in that bunker, as he's working on \"becoming\" General Connor and she's lost everything she's ever known? How do they work as a team later on? Does she have her own semi-religious following? Does she have a relationship with Kyle later on? Do they successfully have kids of their own (seeing as she's heavily pregnant in T:S)?

Honestly, I just love this messy universe and its fucked-up people so dearly. Make me think or make me smile or both, and I'll be happy reader!

Liv Moore (iZombie TV), Major Lilywhite (iZombie TV), Dale Bozzio (iZombie TV), Ravi Chakrabarti (iZombie TV)

I can't believe how little fic there is for this show! Let's remedy that. 

I love Liv and Major together, but the way the series finale left things...how can they possibly find their way back to each other now? Is she mad he got zombified without her <i>and</i> was complicit in the Fillmore-Graves conspiracy? Does he care that she cheated on his friend? Do they land in some kind of fallback angry-bang situation, or are they not speaking, or does D-Day lead to a new chapter?

Other questions: Does Ravi feel like he kinda lost his BFF in this mess? Will Fillmore-Graves try to stop him from finding a vaccine and/or cure? Will Liv's family return, if they now understand what happened to her? 

Alternatively, I'd love to see Dale and Liv bonding over being zombified and still trying to quest for justice and a cure while also securing non-yogurt brains. Bechdel passes are always nice, as are generous uses of Clive!

(Feel free to use/not use characters as you see fit—this is one of those shows where just about every character is my favorite. No redemption of Blaine or his crew, though, please, and no Liv/Ravi or Liv/Blaine.)

I'd prefer something funny or sweet. Some ideas may include: the story of how Tommy and Jon F. first met Jon L. and what that was like. Maybe they're reluctantly amused by him and like him even though he's working on a rival campaign. I'd take lost Twitter exchanges or Slack conversations or all three of them getting drunk together. Jon L. is my favorite, but I like them all. I love jealousy and pining and first times and found families, and I think pretty much all of that is pretty doable in this fandom. Maybe Tommy keeps cockblocking Lovett, and Lovett can't figure out why. Or Lovett is super frustrated by the gorgeous, perfect humans constantly throwing themselves at Tommy. 

In terms of real life partners, I'm not super comfortable with them involved, just because they're not public figures and that feels weird to me. Mentioning them in background or as minor characters is fine, but I'm good with you leaving them out altogether.

I want something cute with Abe and Mihashi really. Also I don't mind if for some reason that Haruna is there and pokes fun of them in some manner or ends up actually being helpful in someway. I really do want something that's just the closeness between Abe and Mihashi though ultimately. I enjoy them as a pair and think their dynamic is super interesting as the series goes on. 

Can be NSFW as well if you want, but I'm not that picky.

ボールルームへようこそ | Ballroom e Youkoso 
Fujita Tatara, Hyoudou Kiyoharu, Hanaoka Shizuku

I would love a story where Hyoudou and Shizuku are in somewhat of a relationship and how they feel with Tatara coming in and how they both end up feeling towards him and each other. It doesn't have to be angsty or have drama in it at all. This can be more mature of a fic or even NSFW if you want it to be but mostly what I am looking for is two people that are allowing a stranger who makes them happy to do so and to care for that person. 

I hope that makes sense.

Akatsuki no Yona | Yona of the Dawn 
Yona (Akatsuki no Yona), Son Hak, Jae-Ha (Akatsuki no Yona)

I would love to have something between Yona, Hak and Jae-Ha. I love their dynamic and basically want to see something established between them, whether that means its all three together at once or with tid bits from times that the three are alone or in separate groups. It should focus on the dynamics of their relationships really. I'm a sucker for good character development. Doesn't have to have relationship drama or anything, but should be something true to the characters or as true as it can be. This can also be a NSFW thing, but doesn't have to be. Whatever makes you comfortable!

I want something with them all being in a relationship. I love the interaction and everything about them and Obi loves Shirayuki and Zen so much. It just makes sense to be honest. I would love for someone to write them together and how they balance all of their duties and how Obi takes care of Zen and Shirayuki in his own way and how they do so for him as well. :) Can be NSFW but doesn't have to be, whatever is good. :D

I’d also rather not see Robert appear / play any large role in the fic. Mentions are fine.

You don’t have to mimic the rhyming structure of the game’s dialogue. I’d rather their dialogue be closer to 19th century language structure than the 21st (since Aurora is from the 19th century), but as long as there’s not any glaringly modern slang/phrases, I’m not going to be fussy about it at all.

Lethal Weapon (TV) 
Trish Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV)), Roger Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon (TV))

Hi Yuletide Author,

Deep down, I'm a shipper at heart who loves happy endings. I'm a sucker for an AU, especially quirky fusion AUs, crossovers (they ienvitably pull me into another fandom), and modern settings. The exceptions would be coffeeshop and high school AUs, which I'm really not a huge fan of. You'll frequently find me browsing the \"Everyone Lives/Nobody Dies\" tags in applicable fandoms where denial is the safest treading ground. Casefics always draw my interest immediately, and if there's a compelling plot with a strong background ship/romance in it, I'm generally happier and more excitable than a hummingbird in a greenhouse. I love reading about women being awesome, even though some of the fandoms I've requested don't necessarily lead to that naturally. I love the 'hero in distress' trope, with a loved one flying into the rescue and big mushy reunion. I dig hurt/comfort like no one's business because I am secretly a marshmallow. I also love \"for want of a nail\" situations, in which one small change leads to huge consequences throughout the canon.

&nbsp;

Things I'm not a fan of would include noncon/dubcon (including sex pollen), ABO dynamics and associated tropes, aforementioned high school/coffeeshop AUs, mpreg (excluding AFAB pregnancies), death fics, unwarranted or irrational jealousy, partner betrayal/cheating, fake/pretend relationships, or prolonged misunderstandings. 

&nbsp;

I do want to let you know that, if you're inclined to write gen, or dislike any of the prompts/pairings, I certainly do not have a problem with it. I want you to enjoy Yuletide as much as possible - it's that season! So if any of these prompts inspire you, then by all means - run wild. If not, then I'll be just as happy to see what inspires you about the fandoms! I'm super easy to please, and I want you to have the best possible Yuletide and holiday season!

&nbsp;

For Lethal Weapon specifically: 

I would be happy with gen, but if you wanted to go somewhere with Trish/Riggs/Murtagh that'd be awesome too. 

Riggs is a sad marshmallow I want to wrap in cotton and love. I would love to see him slowly building a family with the Murtaghs. Or casefic in which he and Murtagh grow increasingly closer. Maybe Murtagh getting a new appreciation for him or seeing him in a different light. Maybe Murtagh saying something completely awful and then regretting it, and slowly finding a way to make up for it. I'd love to see Trish calling Murtagh out and being her badass self.

Midnight Texas (TV) 

I love every character in this show. I even love the canon ships (which is saying something for prime time TV offerings...) 

There was so much focus on the approaching apocalypse that I feel like we didn't get a chance to see the characters here being domestic. Give me your curtain fics. Your fluff. Your adorable headcanons about what they're like at home. 

Or maybe badass ladies swooping in to save the day. Fiji, Olivia and Creek kicking ass and taking names. 

Or maybe Joe and Chuy finally being able to truly be a part of the community, now that their secrets are out. Learning how to create a family again outside of one another.

The Magnificent Seven (2016) 
Joshua Faraday (Magnificent Seven 2016), Vasquez (Magnificent Seven 2016)

I loved this movie so, so very much. Even the ending. But we've had that ending, and now I'd like something that swerves to the left. I'm deep down very attracted to Faraday/Vasquez, because I enjoyed their bash brothers-like relationship in the movie and wanted more. Just more. I love the idea of this fandom set in a Modern AU, or an AU in which everyone lives/nobody dies. If you wanted to include the other characters in the movie, that would be absolutely fine by me - I would just really love to have Faraday/Vasquez as the main focus.

If you were inclined to write a modern AU, I'd love something involving them in law enforcement of any stripes. Or, as a twist, Joshua as the conman and Vasquez as the pursuer.

Should you enjoy writing canon-era, I'd love to see your interpretation of what might happen should a bounty hunter come after Vasquez, and how they're dealt with.

Aaron Cross (Bourne Legacy), Outcome 3 (Bourne Legacy)

These two are so damn pretty together! What if they'd teamed up and left the cabin together? Werewolf AU? What if outcome played around with more than just human DNA? Think Dark Angel-- Aaron has some wolf in his genes and Outcome #3 has some bear(animal of your choice). O#3 seemed to overcome his grumpy/standoffish behavior pretty quick in order to get Aaron to stay around longer. Maybe A/B/O? 

These two agents trying to co-exist in the cabin while they wait out the end of their \"punishment\" from the higher ups. They've got to do something to keep busy.

And I accidentally once read a comment (on youtube) about how Matt separated Marisha and Taliesin because jealousy. I adore Marisha and Taliesin's friendship but also I can't help but go extra defensive when I read stupid stuff like this: so, tell me about the many ways that Matt and Taliesin love each other, all the bonding, whether bromance or romance. The three of them once went to party in the desert together for a few days. Also, I loved the team playing themselves but d&amp;d style during Liam's one shot - why not put them all into Exandria, but as themselves (and adult)? Adventures!

Star Wars Legends: The Old Republic 
Theron Shan (TOR)

I adore Theron Shan and his ridiculous squib/secret agent/mama issue plot. He's everything I ever wanted from a Republic character - pragmatic and still idealistic, hopeful and sarcastic, complex as the force itself. I love stories about his tech abilities, about his smarts and his work ethic, and how deep down he is much more like his mother - and Revan - then he would ever admit. (OMG the Revan connection is such a narrative kink for me. Revan (girl Revan for me, incidentally) is such an influence on how I see the character - grey, but still undeniably good.

There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that means more to me in TOR than Theron in love with my lightside male Sith Warrior. Obviously, you're in no way obligated to include my player character, but whatever you want to write I would ask you to consider that fact your canon for the story - please don't break them up or write him with other people. You don't have to include this in particular, but please don't negate it.

But here's the thing: just because something is <i>problematic</i> doesn't mean it can't be fun and happy. I mentioned in another request that I'm full up on tragedy, so here's the deal: a Folgers story where they get what they so obviously want and figure out a way to be happy.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) 
Rebecca Bunch, Greg Serrano

More info can be found in my letter!

Prompts:

--Rebecca/Greg + any number of tropes– stuck somewhere together; inconvenient bed-sharing; fake dating, the works.
--Rebecca’s blindness toward money is intriguing to me, in a “when is this shit going to REALLY hit the fan” kind of way. What if that had come to a head somehow and she had to get a second job at Home Base? How would she and Greg have taken to working together into the wee hours of the night? (Store-room sex could be a good addition here if you’d like!)
--What’s their dynamic like in a couple of years when Greg returns from Atlanta? Are they over each other or not quite so much?
--Conversely, what if a couple years go by, and Rebecca feels compelled to leave West Covina? Maybe she moves back to NYC (hopefully after a few hundred hours of therapy with Dr. Akopian to give her the coping mechanisms she needs to be happy there). Maybe Greg moves to NYC for a job after graduating Emory. Have they kept in touch enough to know they’re both in the same city again, or do they run into each other randomly, an echo of her NYC run-in with Josh in the pilot, only better, because she’s older and wiser and hopefully better-adjusted?

General DNWs:

--I love Stevie teaching David how to adult. What other normal things has he never experienced before that she needs to walk him through?
--Schitt’s Creek throws a fall festival, complete with a parade. Stevie gets chosen to be Sweet Potato Pie Queen or something equally ridiculous, and David will never. Stop. Teasing. Her. Until the Sweet Potato Pie King (or similar) comes down with shingles and Roland insists David step in.
--Somehow (perhaps through a series of dares?), Stevie winds up running for local government.

20世紀少年 | 20th Century Boys (Manga) 
Endou Kanna, Koizumi Kyouko

For a series that can get so dark at times, I really love the odd-couple humour of Kanna and Kyoko's personality clash – so if you wanted to explore that contrast in any way, then I’d be extremely keen to read it! I’d love to read femslash for this fandom, but I’d also be very happy with gen, so please feel free to take it in either direction. 

Please see my letter for more details and prompts! 

Things I don’t want: smut, non-canon character death, non-canon AUs, crossovers.

Basic Eight - Daniel Handler 
Flannery Culp, Natasha Wyatt

I’d seriously love ship fic for these two, never mind the logistics (especially since Flan herself clearly didn’t, given how often they’re physical together in canon). Some specific prompts: more unrequited sexual tension, /requited/ sexual tension, missing scenes, assorted parties they’ve been to, slice-of-life scenes that would be entirely ordinary if it weren’t for how bizarre their relationship is, snapshots of other past moments when their ultra-intense friendship has nearly overbalanced on the brink of becoming something more - I'd love literally anything.  

Please see my letter for more details and prompts! 

Things I don’t want: non-canon character death, non-canon AUs, crossovers.

惡の華 | Aku no Hana | Flowers of Evil 
Nakamura Sawa, Saeki Nanako

I love the overwhelming mundane bleakness of life in this series, both anime and manga, and I’m guaranteed to be very into anything that preserves that feeling of small-town teenage despair. And I’d also love to read femslash, if you’d like to write it, but if not then I’d be just as happy to see Saeki and Nakamura’s dynamic focused on at all.

モブサイコ100 | Mob Psycho 100 
Kageyama \"Mob\" Shigeo

Ensemble fic, case fic, slice-of-life fic, very wacky trope fic, gen fic, ship fic, lots of characters or only one or two – I’m into all of it and any of it for this fandom, so if we’ve matched here then please write whatever you like best! Mob being unfazed by the weirdness around him is endlessly funny to me, there’s nothing you could write involving him that I wouldn’t be overjoyed by, so if it’s in the spirit of canon then I’m already guaranteed to love it.

iZombie (TV) 
Peyton Charles (iZombie TV), Ravi Chakrabarti (iZombie TV), Liv Moore (iZombie TV), Major Lilywhite (iZombie TV)

So I want a literal four-way, basically. I ship all of these people with each other and at some point mid S2 I decided that I just wanted them all to be in a happy poly relationship, so anything that makes that happen would be a joy to read. Getting-together, slices of life, them hanging out together, having sex, whatever — I’m here for it. I ship every single permutation of the foursome except maybe Peyton/Major, but I can still see it within this context. They’re both stupid hot and love Liv incredible amounts, so why not?

If a foursome is not your thing for whatever reason, I’m fully here for gen involving these four, or shippy fic about one of these couples (maybe preferably leaving room for a foursome to be a thing in the future?). My tastes lean heavily toward Liv/Ravi and Liv/Peyton in that regard. There’ll be more prompts in my letter!

Ysabel - Guy Gavriel Kay 

What happens to Ned afterwards? Does he use his powers for all they're worth or try to ignore them as best he can? Does he keep in contact with Kate?  Why did Ysabel choose Phelan that first time? Was it rebellion,or boredom, or love at first sight? It seems she did love Cadell too, after all. What is it like to be the sole purpose of someone's (two someones actually) entire existence, for so long? Is it any wonder she seems cruel after that? Does Kim teach Ned things about their power? Summers spend training in England perhaps? What is her life like there, anyway? I refuse to believe it's just country doctoring. If you want to go more to the Fionavar direction, what was it like for her just after they returned? Whose decision was it to move to England and why there? How has being Ysabel changed Melanie? Just given her new perspective on things or something more? Maybe she has some of Ysabel's memories now, the same way Ysabel had hers?

Burnt (2015) 
Adam Jones (Burnt), Reece Montgomery

For me, the \"bag scene\" at Reece's restaurant following Adam's breakdown and fall off the wagon is unquestionably the emotional pinnacle of Burnt, and there's just so much angst and relationship past and/or future there to explore. Either you read it as Reece has done this kind of rescue before, because he and Adam were close once and the arch enemies thing only happened later, after a terrible break-up or parting of the ways. Or you can read it as a new low, a new crisis that's the spark for a new closeness between them (though if so, I doubt it would be an easy road; Adam's got a lot of issues he's working through, and I'd bet Reece does too). Bottom line: I'd love more of these two assholes, figuring out—or not, or painfully slowly, with lots of hurdles—how much they need each other and how good they can be together. And/or their past history and how it ended, leaving them in the frenemies place they are now. (Or just hate/frenemy/awkward/whatever sex, TBQH.)

Moon (2009) 
Sam Bell, GERTY

Moon is one of those movies that just sticks with you, and as full of mindfuckery as it already is, I'd like to see more. More twistedness. More gaslighting. More sci-fi strangeness. For example: what if Sam Bell is actually (an) android(s) who believes he's human? (I thought of this recently when rewatching Blade Runner: the four year lifespan of the replicants reminded me of the Bell clones' three year lifespans.) How would the events of the film play out differently in this case? Keep or leave the way that Bell discovers his double (via the rover accident). Hell, if you just wanna retell the clones discovery triggered by different events keeping everything else the same, I think that would be great too. Another opportunity for weirdness would be getting a woke Bell party going: for whatever reason, Bell wakes up a handful of clones. And boy are they a handful. How do they keep each other apart? How does GERTY? Can GERTY tell them apart? The psychology would be fascinating here, especially if some pairs or trios of clones form alliances or there's a single loner...or, or, or... (Feel free to venture into the sexual realm with weirdness between clones if you so desire.)

Ex Machina (2015) 
Caleb Smith, Nathan Bateman, Ava (Ex Machina)

I have one optional request/prompt for Ex Machina: turn it around. I don't care how you set it up or how exactly you interpret \"turning it around\" but I'd love to see Ava being the one who's asking Caleb the questions. Caleb is the one on the cage side of the glass, trapped, attempting to convince Ava that he's human rather than the reverse. Perhaps this is how the conversations between Ava and Caleb turn after a couple of days. (With Nathan optionally assisting Ava in the gaslighting...if it even is gaslighting. Maybe in your version everyone's an android? Or everyone but Caleb.) For a different setup option: maybe on Caleb's first night at Nathan's they go wild (in any sense: drink too much, drugs, hooking up...or all three), and Caleb wakes up disoriented...and behind glass, with Ava embarking on her interview of him. Basically: go wild with gaslighting, manipulation, and as much psychological/philosophical confusion about the nature of being human and how you prove it, and I'll eat it up with a spoon. Note: I've included Nathan here mostly as a potential gaslighting assistant, but you can feel free to leave him out.

The Slains Series - Susanna Kearsley 

What I most love about these books is the sense of place, the rugged Scottish landscape almost like a character itself. And, of course, the Jacobite politics and spies, the back-and-forth in time, and (why deny it?) the romance. I would love a scene featuring the newly reunited Moray family, but I would be very happy with a story about any or all of these characters -- or their modern-day counterparts! Scotland holds a piece of my heart, but I'd certainly enjoy travels to other places, whether slice of life, missing scene, how events could have gone differently, or post-book adventures and intrigue.
Some ideas:
- Reunions are wonderful, but it must be hard getting to know your family so late in life. How do Sophia, John and Anna negotiate this new terrain?
- We know from \"A Desperate Fortune\" that Anna continues using the Jamieson surname, knows how to write in code, and travels with Edmund on behalf of the Jacobite court. What adventures do they have?
- Do any of the modern-day characters continue experiencing memories of the past? What might they see?
- Sophia finally gets her sea voyage! What is the journey like as she sets out to find her long-lost daughter? 

I love a wide variety of genres (seriously, I do - whether fluff or philosophical, mystery or madcap adventure, canon or crossover). However, I am not big on darkfic or heavy angst. Please no noncon, explicit sex or explicit violence. I prefer canon pairings.

Firekeeper Saga - Jane Lindskold 
Firekeeper (Firekeeper Saga), Blind Seer (Firekeeper Saga), Derian Carter

Wilderness, wolves, falcons, magic, intrigue and adventure - I love this series to pieces, especially the very first book. The way Blind Seer takes to reading, the way Firekeeper walks the line between wolf and woman, the strong and deep-running friendships, the worldbuilding... it's all fantastic.
Some ideas:
- Take me back to Firekeeper's days with the wolf pack, when she first bonded with Blind Seer, or to the early days of her friendship with Derian while she was still learning what it means to be human.
- Show me more of how Firekeeper learns to navigate Hawk Haven politics, based on their resemblance to or difference from wolf pack dynamics.
- The Meddler is a fascinating character, and his powers have fascinating implications. I'm not sure how I feel about shipping Firekeeper with anyone at all, but I'm willing to be convinced. If you've ever wanted to explore the what-ifs of shapeshifting as it applies to Firekeeper/Blind Seer (or even Firekeeper/Meddler) go ahead! I'd be interested in the emotional ramifications for both of them, and their friends, but please -- no bestiality.
I love a wide variety of genres (seriously, I do - whether fluff or philosophical, mystery or madcap adventure, canon or crossover). However, I am not big on darkfic or heavy angst. Please no noncon, explicit sex, bestiality, or explicit violence. I prefer het or gen.

Jaran Series - Kate Elliott 
Tess Soerensen (Jaran)

I love the Jaran series for its combination of wild plains, nomadic tribes and intriguing galactic politics. I love the horses, the Jaran language and culture, and the intense \"found family\" relationships. I would love a story set during or shortly after the first book, which is by far my favorite in the series. I adore Tess and Yuri as brother and sister, from their first meeting until the very end. I would also be very happy with a story with Sonia or Ilya, or jahar riders not listed here, like Kirill.
Some ideas:
- Yuri and Tess on an adventure, with or without the rest of the jahar. Or go AU and pretend Yuri never died, and take me with you!
- What if one of the Jaran had seen the shuttle that Tess came from?
- Tess (or someone else) secretly investigating the Chapalii and/or Rhui's ancient archaeological sites.
- Ilya, Yuri and/or Sonia, their escapades and dreams when they were children or young adults.
- Tess and Sonia as sisters, headstrong and capable and conspiring on women's business.

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 

I adore all the Stackpole and Allston X-wing novels, both Rogues and Wraiths, with special love for antics by Wes and Hobbie or Ton and Phanan. I happily ship Corran/Mirax and Wedge/Iella. The pranks, the smart-aleck remarks, the snappy dialogue, unconventional tactics, exciting space battles, the complex characters and grittiness of war — it's all great.
Some ideas:
- Early Rogues: how did Wes and Hobbie meet or become friends? What hijinks did they get up to on Hoth, or with the Ewoks after the battle of Endor?
- Wraith Squadron: more Hawkbat piracy! Screwups redeeming themselves, unlikely heroes and unconventional tactics are my jam.
- Tell me more about Hobbie - how did he get his nickname, anyway?
- Pranks or mission-related hilarity. If it helps, I'm a sucker for undercover tropes. Maybe Dod, Fod and Lod get their encore?
I love a wide variety of genres (seriously, I do - whether fluff or philosophical, mystery or madcap adventure, canon or crossover). However, I am not big on darkfic or heavy angst, and I like to pretend the Yuuzhan Vong war never happened. Please no noncon, explicit sex or explicit violence. And, sorry, I'm not fond of slash with these characters; I prefer het or gen.

Amelia Peabody - Elizabeth Peters 

Amelia is such a hoot. I love how she plows headfirst into trouble, the subtle humor and not-so-subtle absurdities of the situations the whole Emerson family often finds themselves in, the way they defy convention but are still products of their class and time. I also love the strong sense of place and the archaeological details in Egypt.
Some ideas:
- Tell me a mystery with or without the Master Criminal, with or without \"another dead body.\"
- Maybe the children are still young (read: precocious and loquacious) or maybe they are grown, married and chasing after their own offspring.
- Tell me a story of hieroglyph riddles, tomb robbers, international intrigue - or something else entirely. I've always wanted to see the Emersons (and their cats) explore the Great Sphinx; on the other hand, Amelia wants her pyramids and Emerson wants his temples, so they might have their own ideas!
I love a wide variety of genres (seriously, I do – whether fluff or philosophical, mystery or madcap adventure, canon or crossover). However, I am not big on darkfic or heavy angst. Please no noncon, explicit sex or explicit violence (with the exception of parasols). I prefer canon pairings; gen also welcome.

Star Wars: Thrawn - Timothy Zahn 

I have always wanted to read a story about when Thrawn first studied art, and how he discovered he could draw military conclusions based on the insights he'd gleaned in those studies. But any story you'd like to tell about our favorite Grand Admiral will be most welcome -- whether he's rising up the ranks of the Chiss, exiled and surviving alone, or making his way through the Imperial Navy. I'd love to see more of his growing friendship with Eli Vanto, and I'd also love to see more of Karyn Faro. The Imperial Navy is a bit of an old boys' club, and these three are all outsiders in one way or another. Or tell me a story of Eli's adventures after the book ends!
