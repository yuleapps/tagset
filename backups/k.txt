Atelier - Alchemists of Arland 
Rorolina "Rorona" Frixell (Arland), Cordelia von Feuerbach (Arland), Totooria "Totori" Helmold (Arland), Mimi Houllier von Schwarzlang (Arland)

First off, you don't have to include all four of them in the story! I love both Rorona/Cordelia and Totori/Mimi, preferably as girlfriends but also as BFFs, and I also like gen interactions between any combination of the four. Pick whoever you'd like!

The thing I really loved about the later Atelier games, especially the Arland series, was the focus on characters having day-to-day interactions with each other, particularly the female characters. So basically what I want is more of that! As long as you write any combination of the girls having positive relationships with each other, I will probably be happy.

See letter for specific prompt ideas!

DNW:
- de-aged Rorona from Atelier Meruru (background mentions/cameos are okay, but not as a major character please)
- anything to do with psych wards or mental institutions (minor references are okay, detailed discussions are not)
- non-vanilla sex (nothing kinkier than light bondage basically)
- unrequested ships for requested characters
- non-canonical major character death
- crossovers
- different setting AUs
- angsty/hopeless endings (bittersweet is fine)

Kamen Rider 555 
Osada Yuka (Kamen Rider 555)

Basically, Yuka is my darling child, and I would love nothing more than to take her to a nice, safe environment with nice people who don't want to hurt her, wrap her up in a blanket, and get her some therapy. I would like the poor girl to be happy for more than five minutes, in a healthy fashion, or at least start working through some of her issues. She did not get nearly enough time for this in canon, and it saddens me, so I'd love it if you could do something to remedy that, even just a little. This is not to say the story has to be super fluffy, but at least try to keep it fairly positive, if you would.

I'd prefer a fix-it where she doesn't die, or at least that you end the fic before she does.

The fic can be shippy or not, but if you go the shippy route, my preferred ships are Yuka/Takumi, Yuka/Kiba, and Yuka/Keitarou, in that order.

See letter for specific prompt ideas!

DNW:
- Yuka/Kaidou (references to it as a past thing or Yuka having a crush are okay, but nothing bigger than that)

Star Wars Legends: X-wing Series - All Media Types 
Garik "Face" Loran (X-Wing), Ton Phanan (X-Wing)

I first read these books in middle school and immediately fell in love with these two snarky assholes and all the crap they get up to. I love their bantering, the way they immediately fell into being partners, their extreme dedication to prank wars, all of it. So I would like it very much, dear writer, if you could write them having further shenanigans of this sort.

I'd also enjoy anything that explores them dealing with their personal demons, especially in Phanan's case since he didn't as much chance to resolve his in the books. I really enjoyed both of their character arcs in canon and would love to see them expanded on.

I would like it very much if Phanan somehow didn't die, but I care most about what works for the story, so do what you have to do. I'd rather he was alive for most of it, though :P

I'd be happy with gen, slash, or poly (with Dia or someone else). Do what makes you happy.

See letter for specific prompt ideas!

DNW:
- bashing Dia or having Face cheat on her (sidelining Dia for Face/Phanan slash is okay, but please be respectful about it)

Night In The Woods (Video Game) 
Mae Borowski

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

MAN I loved this game. It wasn't perfect but I love the sense of place we get about Possum Springs, and how like a real place it feels, with its long history -- from the Andrew Carnegie expy and the coal mining days right down to the recently-abandoned Food Donkey and the details of the flood years ago. I also love the... autumnalness of the game? and how it encomasses homecoming and harvest and fun spooky stories but also death and sacrifice and a literal fall. And I knew a lot of Maes, Beas, Greggs, and Anguses in my awkward stumble through my early twenties. (I've been them too.) It just felt incredibly true to life for a game that's about talking animals and a cult, set in the kind of town I definitely didn't grow up in.

That said, I was left wanting to know more... so here I am asking for fanfic of it. I really really want to know what happens next, I guess? "Next" is flexible -- what happens within the next weeks or months; what happens in two years? Five? Ten? Does anyone like... notice all the people who are suddenly missing from the town who presumably died horribly in an abandoned mine? Does Mae go back to college or does she opt to do something else, assuming she's able to get her life back together? Do Gregg and Angus live happily ever after? Does Bea ever get like... anything resembling happiness?

(I hope so.  She's been through some shit.)

So okay, that's a lot of questions, although I'm not sure they constitute prompts.  I'd really like something exploring the worldbuilding of the 'verse and how (whether?) Mae's dreams and visions tie into that.  (My general preference is that this is somewhat related to her mental health issues but that it isn't just all in her head.  But I like ambiguity too.)  I'd also just plain like to see her happy, maybe going back to school but maybe finding something in town to do.

I don't really have my heart set on specific ships and am 100% fine with gen focused on worldbuilding or adventure or a specific friendship, but I think my favorite Mae ship is Mae/Lori, weirdly enough?  The Lori M segments were my favorite parts outside of the Gregg and Bea outings, and I'd also totally be happy with them as platonic friends but I think it would be cute for Lori to have a kind of kid crush on Mae that develops into a real thing once she's older.  I also slightly shipped Mae/Selmers in the game (because of <i>course</i> I listened to all the poems) and I'd be curious to see what would happen if Mae ran into the Bombshell again.  (Would bad decisions ensue or could she be honest and also not weird?)

I'd also love fics concentrating on Mae's friendship with Bea, Gregg, Lori, Selmers, Germ, and... really probably anyone else in the cast she was friendly with, including the weird janitor.  I'd also love to see a fic about young Mae and her grandfather.

Also, just throwing it out there -- if you wanna totally ditch Mae (much as I love her) and write me fic about <i>what the actual fuck</i> happened to the Deep Hollow Hollerers, that'd be AWESOME.

<b>General DNWs:</b> Explicit/intense non-canonical child abuse; characters under 15 in consensual sexual situations and under 18 in nonconsensual ones; stories about how family is always 100% awesome; incest; painplay; humiliation; M/f; anal; lengthy kink negotiation.

Hiveswap 
Joey Claire (Hiveswap)

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

Hiveswap was incredibly charming and '90s-nostalgic for me, and I also really love fish out of water stories, so while I fell in love with Joey as she ran away from the monsters, watching her get to Alternia and explore this weird troll planet's weird troll culture was <i>a delight.</i>  So I'd really really like to see more of her on Alternia.  Feel free not to worry about what timeline this is even set in Homestuck-wise, or the implied time limit before the portal opens and she can go back to earth -- I'm totally fine with fic that sends her back home at the end but if you also want to write her staying on Alternia and becoming some kind of alien rebel leader (who is also a ballerina veterinarian) who takes down the empire, feel free!  (Or, have her bring some a troll or five home with her!)

I really loved Joey's interactions with Xefros and I'd love to see more of them interacting.  I could ship them as moirails, or you could just write regular old friendship fic!  I'd like to see "alien trying to blend in with native inhabitants" shenanigans with them either on Alternia or Earth, or maybe rebellion stuff, or just... pick up where canon leaves off with them on the run from the Heiress' forces.

And okay, I know there's basically nothing we know about Trizza yet except that she's TERRIBLE, but I'd love to see Joey and Trizza interactions!  If you want to do some kind of redemption arc I'd love Joey ♥ Trizza or some kind of weird friendship or moirallegiance, but I'm also really into enemy ships and would love to see Joey ♠ Trizza.  (If you write a redemption arc for Trizza, though, please make sure she's done something she needs redemption from, though.)

I haven't mentioned Jude but I'm very fond of him too, and if you wanted to have a Jude-heavy fic that's great!  I'd just prefer that it also had some weirdness also involved?  Maybe Joey comes back from Alternia and they hunt down the cult together/take on Betty Crocker/whatever?

Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Justice of Toren One Esk Nineteen | Breq

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

These books were so good that after I finished them I actually went and hunted down all of Ann Leckie's other stories (and actually I also really like her fantasy 'verse centering around gods needing worship to survive -- so, uh, have a random rec?).  I'm confident I'll really enjoy Provenance even though I haven't finished it yet, so feel free to incorporate worldbuilding or other stuff from it.  Anyway!

The things I loved most about the books, in no particular order: all the descriptions of tea; Breq's collection of songs and her anthropological interest in them and their lyrics and their misinterpretations (oh tree! where's my ass?); loving descriptions of outfits including gloves and/or scandalous lack thereof (I like handporn, so sue me); a narrative that really vividly depicts both the appealing and appalling aspects of empire and colonialism ("luxury always comes at someone else's expense"); Breq's heroism and sarcasm and her moral code and her insistence on trying to do the right thing; the thought that goes into the worldbuilding, in particular that the various planets don't generally have one uniform culture but many that interact in complicated ways with each other; the interesting interplay of Breq's multiple selves and the general evolution of her sense of self throughout her history as a ship and as a separate entity.

Anyway, I would love you to do something with any of the above!  Hopefully it was at least somewhat coherent.

My ships (such as they are) include onesided Justice of Toren/Lieutenant Awn; Seivarden/Breq; and Breq/Mercy of Kalr, so I'd be really pleased if you concentrated on any one of those relationships, whether or not you wanted to make them explicitly romantic or sexual.  The thing that appeals to me most is the bond of loyalty between these particular characters, and so if you bring that out (either by testing their loyalty or reaffiriming it) I will probably be happy!  Maybe show me how Lt. Awn ended up becoming one of Justice of Toren's favorites, or some hurt/comfort between Seivarden, Breq, and/or Mercy of Kalr.  I don't think I have any NOTPs in this fandom, though, so if you have another relationship in mind that you'd prefer to write, please go ahead.

While I didn't request them, I'd also be super interested in fic about Anaander Mianaai's rise to power, or Translators Dlique and/or Zeiat's origins/upbringing.

The Switch (TV) 
Chris (The Switch)

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

This show is so delightfully surreal while also having some really touching moments, and while I love Su and her struggles... I really found myself craving more awkward eco-assassin shenanigans.  Chris in general is a lot of fun; I love how they don't seem to see an actual ethical issue with, you know, murdering oil execs with a crossbow, and their enthusiasm for their cause, and their general awkwardness around all things interpersonal.  (I was actually an environmental studies major in college and so a lot of the things they get excited about are things my peers and I spent a lot of time discussing the ethics of.  Somehow crossbows never came up?  Anyway, if you'd enjoy it, feel free to have them go into nerdy detail about grey water recycling or composting or something, because I would actually be interested.)

They're also apparently the only person Toni feels even vaguely comfortable with opening up about his feelings to, and I'd actually really like to see how the two of them met, and how they got into this business, or where things go from where canon leaves off -- both with Toni's transition (and maybe some discussion of Chris' transition? -- they do not appear to be out to Toni considering the awful things he said about them being "real women") and with the, uh, assassination business.  (I would, however, prefer that even if a fic deals largely with transitions that there's plenty of assassin shenanigans as well.)

I also really really enjoy Chris' relationship with Zoey and Sandra, and I have to admit, when Chris and Sandra got mistaken for Zoey's parents I kind of instantly started shipping it?  Also, Chris' defense of Zoey was (as is their trademark) both genuinely sweet and pretty offputting.  I'd love to see the dire awful/awkwardness of flirting with the person you are investigating for multiple homicide.

Chris/Isabelle is also pretty cute in a violent kind of way and I'd be cool with something concentrating on them -- maybe the rest of their date night?  Please feel free to ignore my general painplay DNW if you write this!

Sword & Sworcery EP 
All-Knowing God | Player (Sword & Sworcery EP), The Scythian

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

So this game is so surreal and beautiful and sad, and I was actually really upset when I came to the gradual realization that the Scythian's woeful errand was actually killing her, rather than the loss of lives being solely a game mechanic to make it harder.  She seems to know it, but it's concealed from the player, and that really intrigues me.  I'm also curious about the game being an experimental treatment for soul-sickness -- is the player character a patient somewhere, in a world where soul-sickness is a thing?  And the Scythian seems to think of the player as an all-knowing god guiding her along, so I'm super curious whether she's been hearing something guiding her along for a while now.  How real is this whole setting?  What if the Scythian was to realize her god was <i>not</i> all-knowing?  What if the Player refused to complete the woeful errand and found a way to save the Scythian?  What on earth does the Scythian think about the Archetype randomly appearing and teaching her Sworcery?

I know this is an insane meta prompt (and I think that's fair; it's an insane meta game) but if you're not feeling it, please feel free to write something about the Scythian just assuming all that soul-sickness treatment jazz is not a thing.  What did she tell Logfella about growing up on the steppes and the finger of God, and her fearless Scythian brothers and sisters?

Worldbuilding about Mingi Taw, the Gogolithic Mass, why Scythians hate rainbows, or what exactly the Sylvian Sprites are would be cool too!  I also really like Girl and her weird dreams and her ability to see the sprites, and the way she worries about the Scythian, and her enthusiasm for miracles.  I'd love a fic that focused on her relationship with the Scythian.  (I've seen them shipped, and I've also seen them written as being like sisters; either is cool with me.)

They never really explain why Girl and Logfella live together, and Girl/Logfella is okay with me, but Girl being Logfella's sister or something is okay too.

We Know the Devil (Visual Novel) 

There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!

This game is incredibly creepy and I love it and I want to hug all three of the main characters.  I'd just really like to spend more time with them?  I'm open to any combination of OT3/pairings here, and anything from stuff concentrating on one of the girls, two of them, or an ensemble fic.

Jupiter's passive trying-to-be-chill-even-when-chill-is-not-possible is very relateable to me, and her self-loathing and fear of touching and the whole rigamarole with the hairtie is so awfullll for her.  I'd like to learn more about her parents, because it sounds like they have a pretty awkward marriage of convenience and while her father is at least a little more understanding neither parent is doing a great job here.  Maybe show me the aftermath of the red ending (assuming she lives), and whether she changes?  Does she become more open about things and maybe a little bitter like Neptune, or does she double down on the Midwestern Nice facade?

Neptune <i>fascinates</i> me, because she's incredibly bitter and rebellious and seems to know a lot about the whole God/Devil situation than the others, but we don't really know much about her life outside of the camp except that she's got a friend she texts with constantly.  I'd really like to know more about her backstory, and I'd love some worldbuildy stuff about the culture of this 'verse and what her parents/family expect of her.  Did she get in some specific kind of trouble to get sent to this camp, or is she just there on the basis of her general attitude?  Fallout after the blue ending would also be interesting to see.

Venus is a sweetheart, and I'd like to see more of her fiddling with the radios, struggling to fit in, etc., and I also find those moments where she surprises people by talking back and being angry as fuck are actually really endearing to me -- I'd like to see some exploration of that depth if you choose to concentrate on Venus in your fic.  I'd also like to see how she deals after the yellow ending; I think of all of them she suddenly gains and then just as suddenly loses the most freedom and self-expression and it must be incredibly painful for her.  Hers was the first "bad ending" I saw because I was shipping Jupiter/Neptune hardcore, and I think it's really interesting that her "devil" form gives me serious creepy Biblical angel vibes.  (I mean all of them do, but ESPECIALLY hers.)  Also more stuff about her radio expertise would be great!

In general I'd love to see worldbuilding about what the Devil and God really are, and the radios, and the magical girls, and just... all of it.  If you're willing I'd also love to see stuff set in the true ending where they get to keep their new bodies, and hopefully hold out against the shitty camp authorities/legal authorities/....religious authorities?

A Charm of Magpies Series - K. J. Charles 

I love Charm of Magpies and I'm devastated by the lack of fic for it. Please write me anything with the four characters mentioned. I can't get enough of Lucien and Steph, even after three books and multiple short stories. The cute height difference, their inability to stay mad at each other, the fancy clothes Lucien makes Steph accept. And Ned and Crispin get no love!! Where are all the cute fics about my favorite former magical apprentice/novice justicar and his extremely beautiful waste paper seller boyfriend? I especially love the themes of words and writing making magic in Rag and Bone, too, and would love to see it explored more through Ned and Crispin's relationship! Maybe an exchange of letters while one is away on business? Wherever your fancy takes you, author, I am happy to follow!

Wants: Hurt/comfort is my jam, emphasis on the comfort. Please don’t actually do too much hurting. I’m also very into friends to lovers and soulmate goofiness. I’m happy with any rating, so go as clean or as filthy as you’d like. Light kinky stuff is also fine.

Do not wants: Gore, body horror, rape, torture porn, anything Hollywood likes putting in horror movies these days.

Think of England - K. J. Charles 
Daniel da Silva, Archie Curtis

Can we talk about how perfect "Think of England" is? I haven't read a book so fast in my LIFE. I was only introduced to K.J. Charles this year, and I feel hashtag blessed. "Think of England" was the first book of her's I read, and I'm almost sad I didn't wait to read it further into her bibliography, but I'm also glad I did, because it made me download pretty everything else she's written and tear through them like a mad dog. Anyway, the hurt/comfort in this book really got me right in the soul, and I would love to read more, but I'll take pretty much anything you're willing to write for these two! What other fancy parties can they infiltrate? What other members of high society can they bring down? And where will they find time to be alone during it? So many questions, and the answers are all up to you, author!

Wants: Hurt/comfort is my jam, emphasis on the comfort. Please don’t actually do too much hurting. I’m also very into friends to lovers and soulmate goofiness. I’m happy with any rating, so go as clean or as filthy as you’d like. Light kinky stuff is also fine.

Do not wants: Gore, body horror, rape, torture porn, anything Hollywood likes putting in horror movies these days.

The Good Place (TV) 
Eleanor Shellstrop, Tahani Al-Jamil

Okay, but you know what I'm going to request: What was the go 'round with Tahani as Eleanor's soulmate like? Did Eleanor ruin it the moment she told Tahani she didn't belong there? Did she fall in love immediately and keep her trap shut, seeking out Chidi to help her become a good enough person to be worthy of her giraffe-like soulmate? Was Tahani the one who fell in love at first sight, but was still put off by the tiny house with the creepy clown paintings? Did she try to make it work, despite the tiny insufferable blonde they matched her with (a la the first season with Jason)? Have at, author! Go as fluffy or as filthy as you like.

Outside Xbox RPF 
Mike Channell (Outside Xbox RPF), Jane Douglas (Outside Xbox RPF), Andy Farrant (Outside Xbox RPF)

I am quite simply in love with all the oxboxers, and the fictional universe just slightly parallel to our own which they inhabit. I'd prefer a story set in the show's universe rather than the real world - as in, a story set in the world in which Jane really is a mad scientist, time travel is real, Luke has an evil twin, and James the camera man really was turned into a sheep, rather than a story about a really talented bunch of YouTubers with fertile imaginations. That said, I don't necessarily want a lot of fantastic or supernatural elements or an adventure story; I'd prefer something that focuses on the relationships and interactions in their fictional everyday lives. With only incidental explosions. Much like the show itself, in fact!

Please do include romance and sex, if that's your cup of tea. My personal headcanon is that Mike, Jane and Andy are all in a complicated and delightful relationship together, but I am happy with any pairing that does not exclude any of the other characters. I would be happy to see Luke and Ellen included in the story, but I don't particularly ship them with anyone (except with themselves as platonic life partners), so I would prefer it if you do not include them in any ships with the characters I did request. 

Explicit sex is very welcome, but I would prefer if it were not the focus of the story. There's so much else I'd like to read about, when it comes to this gang! That said, with the above exceptions, I would be happy with most anything. Notification squid says thank you, and happy writing! &lt;コ:彡

Back to the Future: The Game 
Young Emmet Brown (Back to the Future: The Game), Emmet "Doc" Brown (Back to the Future: The Game), Marty McFly (Back to the Future: The Game)

I've been a BTTF fan ever since the films came out originally, but this game marked the point where I started to seriously consider Doc and Marty as a romantic pairing. If reading that just now made you panic and wonder how you can back out of your assignment this year, don't worry! I'm a lifelong fan of this franchise for a reason, and I like Doc/Marty because I like Doc and Marty, period. As characters, as friends; I enjoy their dynamic, however you want to interpret it. That's what I like, and that's what I'd like a story about. 

I've requested both Doc and young Emmet for a reason: I am very much against the idea that Marty would bond more with young Emmet because they are of an age, or that he would prefer him to Doc, or - in the case of a romantic relationship - that he would be attracted only to young Emmet, not Doc as an older man. To my mind, Doc and Marty are drawn together despite their difference in ages, and that difference changing would not change the relationship. (As indeed shown when Marty meets 1955!Emmet.) 

I do, however, like how meeting Emmet makes Marty see his friend from another point of view. I would like a story that focuses on Marty getting to know young Emmet, and how their relationship (romantic or otherwise) develops, and how it, in turn, affects his relationship with Doc. I'm a sucker for first-time stories, so if you do want to slash them, I would very much enjoy a story in which Marty realizes he's in love with Doc through meeting Young Emmet. Slow burn is too much to ask for in a story exchange, but I do like my romances drawn-out and pining. Explicit sex is fine, and very welcome. 

If you're not slashing them, a story focusing on their friendship and relationship dynamic would be fantastic. Oh, and if you could include alternate 1986 Jennifer, that would make me very happy indeed. Yes, that goes for both slash and gen writers! Please don't erase Marty's relationship to her. 

Thank you for writing, and reading this - happy Yuletide!

Robot Series - Isaac Asimov 
R. Daneel Olivaw, Elijah Baley

Really, I could sum this one up rather neatly; casefic and porn. I would be happy with just the first, less happy with just the latter, but both together would have me overjoyed. 

I'm a huge fan of both classic detective fiction, robots, and science fiction, so naturally Daneel and Elijah's adventures are some of my favorite novels. I also really love their relationship dynamic, however you'd like to interpret that. My absolute dream story would be a new adventure from their glory days, with added UST which is eventually resolved into explicit porn. But just casefic on its own would be grand, though I would hope it would include some exploration of their friendship/relationship. 

I also really like worldbuilding, so if you're into that, feel free to explore/expand the Asimov's future world. Setting is up to you; I'd be equally happy with something set on Earth, as something set on a Spacer planet, or elsewhere. 

Explicit sex is fine, and I do love a long-drawn out first-time story. That said, plot is more important than porn. Thank you so much for reading and writing - happy Yuletide!

Jeeves - P. G. Wodehouse 
Reginald Jeeves (Jeeves - P. G. Wodehouse), Bertram "Bertie" Wooster (Jeeves - P. G. Wodehouse)

I don't think a single Yuletide has gone by in which I have not requested Jeeves/Wooster. I absolutely adore these two - they are my comfort pairing, and a thing of joy. As you can see, I'd much prefer a story in which there is romantic sentiment between them, but don't worry if you don't ship them or do not want to write slash - I would be happy to read about their relationship as a friendship, in that case. 

Ideally, I would prefer a story written in first person, but I have no clear preferences as to whom should be the narrator. Bertie, of course, narrates most of the stories in canon, but if you are more of a Jeeves, or would rather write in his voice, nothing would be better than that. Write what you prefer, not what you think I would prefer. That always makes for the best story, I find. If you have it in you to write a convoluted caper from which our intrepid heroes escape through Jeeves's cunning wit, none would be happier than myself to receive it. However, if you would rather write a little slice of life story, please do. If you do choose to go the romance route, I am very fond of the UST, slow burn genre. Explicit sex is welcome! 

Thank you for reading and writing, and happy Yuletide!

Back to the Future (Movies) 
Marty McFly (Movie), Emmett "Doc" Brown (Movie)

As I mentioned in my prompt above, I've been a BTTF fan ever since the films came out originally. I'm a lifelong fan of this franchise for a reason, and I like Doc/Marty because I like Doc and Marty, period. As characters, as friends; I enjoy their dynamic, however you want to interpret it. That's what I like, and that's what I'd like a story about. 

Don't worry if you don't slash them, or would be uncomfortable writing a story featuring a romantic relationship between the characters - I would be equally happy with something exploring their relationship dynamic as friends. If you do want to write a romance, I am a huge fan of slow burn/UST with an explicit sex payoff at the end. 

That said, I am a huge science fiction fan in general, and I love time travel! Plot makes me happy, and I very much enjoy time paradoxes. Doc and Marty solving impossible problems and saving the time space continuum is very much up my alley. Something I'd really like to see, is Doc from other times in his life - Emmet Brown in his twenties would be interesting, as would an older Marty. Cross timelines for fun and profit!

On a final note, please do not erase Marty's relationship with Jennifer, or Doc's marriage even if you write slash. I'm no fan of girlfriend/wifeless AU. 

Thank you for writing, and reading this - happy Yuletide!

La Comédie Humaine - Honoré de Balzac 
Corentin (Comédie Humaine)

I love Corentin and there are a grand total of zero fics about him, so the world is your oyster here. I would be happy with casefic or a character study or PWP, gen or slash or het.

If you like historical RPF, I'd love a fic about Corentin's relationship with Fouché or a crossover that pits him against a baby Chabouillé early in their careers. If your taste runs more to sinister plots, it would be fun to see him go up against Vautrin again. Or what if he's forced to work with Laurence de Cinq-Cygne to thwart some Restoration-era plot against the Bourbons? Or if you're more in the mood for domestic drama, he could babysit Peyrade after one of his benders or spend a cozy-yet-creepy-around-the-edges Christmas with Lydie.

Femmeslash would be amazing. If you'd prefer to maintain their intense but non-sexual relationship from the book, that's fine too. I just desperately need some fic about them.

I'd love a canon-divergent AU where Bette and Valérie win the day, or a fic that translates the story into a different setting. Or you could explore their relationship in canon: fluff in which Valérie drags Bette with her to the theater or takes her shopping for curtains, darkfic that looks at all the ways in which they are using each other and the toxic interplay between Valérie's honeyed manipulation and Bette's viciousness and need for power and control. Or Valérie could turn her extensive experience in the art of seduction to a less lucrative but more emotionally fulfilling purpose and introduce Bette to sex.

Political RPF - France 19th c. 
Henri Gisquet (Political RPF - France 19th c.)

In the space of two years Henri Gisquet went from an architect of the July Revolution to the Prefect of Police who suppressed the June Rebellion. I'd love to see some fic that deals with Gisquet and the political situation in all its chaos and contradictions: what he thinks of the July Monarchy or the things he's been called upon to do, how a man can topple a government to defend the freedom of the press and find himself arresting newspaper editors just a few years later.

What are his interactions with Casimir Périer like during this era? Périer is much more conservative than Gisquet and disapproved of the July Revolution, so his decision to appoint him Prefect is intriguing.

Alternatively, it's always fun to see him lock horns with Chabouillé. Or he could confront other figures of the time like Charles Jeanne or Armand Marrast or Adolphe Crémieux.

The Village (UK TV) 
Stephen Bairstow (The Village)

I love Stephen Bairstow's increasingly bizarre and codependent partnership with the Allingham family, and it would be great to get some fic about it. In the space of two seasons Bairstow has gone from being Edmund's eyes in the village to more or less running his political life, arranging a tolerable marriage for him, saving Caro from drowning, and getting Caro the son she desperately misses and Clem the grandchild she desperately wants. The power dynamics of this shift intrigue me. Bairstow is still a servant and seems to have the family's best interests at heart, but they've come to a point where he's willing to act against orders if he feels the situation warrants it and he's not exactly "loyal retainer" material. Can the Allinghams trust him? Do they deserve his help? What does he really want from them and from his life?

I'd be happy with any fic about the situation: Machiavellian political shenanigans, the aftermath of the sacking/blackmail confrontation, Caro's reaction to finally having a real ally in her life, Bairstow/Edmund, Bairstow/Clem.

I'd really love to see something that feels like an issue of the comics (powers! villanous plots! good saves the day!), but I'm also a sucker for worldbuilding- like, what do they do in their life? What's it like to have those powers?

Since there's not much in the way of canon for these characters, I feel like you can pretty much start anywhere you like- origin stories, in media res of a massive comics crossover event, whatever. :) And I like a lot of comics history- I'm happy to see you play it as golden age four-colors or 90's gritty or anything in between.

I love this relationship. I like Bob's respect for Dr Angleton and his wholly-justified fear of him, and I wish that we'd had more of an exploration of Angleton's motivation and reasoning with respect to Bob. We know why he is loyal to the Laundry, but not why he chose Bob as his assistant and successor, or why he felt one would be necessary. I love the early books, and little short story tie-ins with little mini mysteries for Bob to unravel.

By the time we see them on the show they are clearly already at odds, but how did they get there? Was it just jealousy on Atia's part? Distaste on Servilia's? How did Atia feel after her adversary was no longer there, how did she adjust to a world where she didn't have Servilia to compete against? Anything about these two would be wonderful.

* Tell me how Ashe sees Therem: what was it that attracted him?
* Tell me how their relationship functions in private between the two of them. Is Therem aware from the start that it is doomed? Is Ashe? How does Therem reconcile his responsibilities to Ashe and the children when he walks away? What made Therem leave?
* Tell me about the context in which their relationship coalesced! Was it during the height of their careers? Before?
* Tell me how others around the two view them. 

In case it's not immediately obvious, I am ready for pain in this fandom. So much pain: transformative pain, or recuperative pain, or chronic, long-carried pain. Whether it's carried with dignity or not, I'd love to read about how things that hurt, that don't work, that build up and then maybe fall apart are nevertheless important, and meaningful.

The Wire 
Jimmy McNulty, Kima Greggs

DNW-Jimmy raping Kima!  AU, MPREG. Please no A/B/O/Omegaverse/knotting or associated aspects, tropes etc. 

I pretty much ship Jimmy with everyone and everything, but this is the true wrong/dirty/bad/problematic Wire ship of my heart and I ship it HARD!!!  If we matched on these characters, I'm hoping it means you're on board and willing to go at least part way to Hell with me. 

I LOVE Jimmy McNulty. I love him in all his messed up, alcoholic, self-destructive glory, and I'm really interested in fic with him getting some sex....possibly drunken, self-destructive, dub-con, OMG what have I done sex. I'm fine with graphic, but not particularly interested in PWP. I'm way more concerned with how it happened and what the aftermath might be, even it's just all parties deciding never to speak of it again. 

I'm NOT looking for any kind of gay erasure. Kima is who she is and whatever might happen in a drunken moment or if she were acting out in some way is not going to change that, but I still think something could happen and the aftermath would be a whole lot of WTF. The only thing I don't want for this pairing is non-con with Jimmy as the aggressor.  I'm OK with dub-con in terms of both of them being shit-faced and making bad decisions, or even Kima being the aggressor and Jimmy knowing it's a bad idea, but being too fucked up or just too Jimmy to hold out and giving in against his better judgement. Maybe Kima having to deal with her guilt for cheating or taking advantage of Jimmy or confusion for any amount of enjoyment, but NOT, NOT, NOT ever, Jimmy out and out raping Kima. I'm also good with either of them fantasizing about the other, complete with WTF on Kima's part if it's her.

Perhaps something happening after the hotel room scene in "Moral Midgetry" because I'll bet Jimmy gives a helluva massage that could lead to anything from mutual masturbation, separate wanking in the two beds with either shared dialogue or attempted silence, to an out and out sex scene followed by complete denial that anything ever happened, which would lend extra resonance to Kima's response when the sheriff tells Kima that her partner is "a bit of an asshole." 

If Bunk and or Bubbles get any hint of something going on or having gone on and want to lend their individual wit, wisdom and snark to the situation, that would be fabulous. 

On the Genfic side, I'm good with any tidbits of them just hanging out by the tracks or doing actual MCU work complete with snarky take-downs of other characters. I adore the scenes where Kima is forced to acknowledge her own "Inner McNulty" and gets the chance to laugh at herself about it, so anything in that vein is fine.

Bryan's cover of It's My Party where he keeps the names and genders unchanged might be relevant, as differentiated from his version Back to Black, for instance.
Any connection between Bryan/David and Jerry leaving Bryan for Mick Jagger?
Early 80's---Avalon/Station to Station. MTV...Let's Dance. Lots of cocaine going on.  Both of them at their most totally gorgeous. Who could resist?
I'm not picky about who loves who or who tops or whether it's love, lust, drugs, alcohol etc.
Cheating on wives/girlfriends/boyfriends and bandmates is fine.
Also any other characters you want to throw in from the Warhol crowd or the Bowie, Iggy, Lou history.  Perhaps the affair, relationship, one-nighter is an inspiration for a song such as Mother of Pearl, Avalon, Casanova or Can't Let Go?  From David's POV, how about the piss-taking of the character that is clearly a Bryan expy in the long form video of Jazzing For Blue Jean? Maybe affectionate, maybe not so much?
Seriously, put them together in any way, size, shape or form and I'll be happy.  I'm also fascinated by Bryan's alleged snobbery, which is probably rooted in class consciousness of his more humble beginnings in Newcastle. I'd love it if a bit of Geordie accent slipped at the height of passion, rather than his usual impeccable RP.
No need to stay vanilla, although I'm fine if you do.  Divine decadence or sheer elegance.
I’m also good with any kind of triangular involvement or threesomes, regardless of the genders involved or just cameo appearances if you share my passion for those people. Throw in Angie, Kari-Ann, Amanda Lear, Jerry Hall, Nico, Lucy Ferry, Iman, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Brian Eno etc., as you see fit.
If the slash isn't speaking to you, and you're look for a Gen idea...don't forget this quote from Bryan, which he actually attributes to Nicky Haslam.

"Other bands wanted to wreck hotel rooms; Roxy Music wanted to redecorate them.”

DIY projects, clothes fittings, hilariously mundane trips to Ikea?

Bryan contemplating David's death and his own mortality either from a slash or non-slashy perspective would be lovely.

Justified 
Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder

DNW- AU, MPREG. Not crazy about cross-overs unless otherwise noted.
Please no A/B/O/Omegaverse/knotting or associated aspects, tropes etc. 

&nbsp;

I loved this show so much for its great writing and not to mention all the supporting characters who could scare you to death, piss you off, or break your heart in any given scene, due to the writing and acting.

My special passion however is the Ho-yay/Foe-yay between Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder.  While I believe Boyd truly falls in love with Ava, I also think that he and Raylan have something deep and lasting between them, no matter how many times they try kill or incarcerate each other.  I know it’s the biggest cliché in the fandom, but there’s just no way that “We dug coal together,” doesn’t mean something deeper.

While I’d love to see some fairly hard-core slash for these two, I’d also be good with some UST, or just obsession on the part of one or the other.  It could be something back in the “dug coal” days or a missing scene from some point in the cannon.  If you don’t go for the actual sex, I’d be happy with a fantasy masturbation scene on the part of either character, or even something from Ava or any other character’s point of view, who finds their relationship titillating. Extra bonus love for any way you might find to get Wynn Duffy in there as a participant, fantasist, or observer because there’s no snark like Wynn Duffy snark.

Anything that slots into missing space within canon makes me happy, as does a possible post-series fic.  I’m not particularly a fan of schmoop, but something that shows Raylan to have genuine feelings toward Boyd would be appreciated, especially post series.  I KNOW he was manipulating Boyd in the last scene, but I also believe/feel/need/want him to FEEL something for this man he’s known so long and FAILED to kill on many occasions when he could have.  Perhaps, against all odds, Boyd gets paroled and Raylon decides to intercept him long enough to give Ava a head start and the best or only way is to play the “We dug coal” card and things HAPPEN…and Raylan likes it happening more than he wants to admit.

In general I tend to sympathize with Boyd over Raylan far more than any right-thinking person should. Walton Goggins slow-burn sexiness tends to make me forget that he's supposed to be the baddie. Also the fact that almost every season had a baddie who was so much baddier and less appealing. So if there's anyway that Boyd "wins" in whatever the scenario is, I'd be thrilled, although I understand this might not be realistic or fit in with canon, so I leave that to your discretion. Maybe it's nobody wins, or just sweet enough that everybody does.

For a gen prompt, anything where Boyd is willing to work with Raylan to protect Ava from any of the numerous truly evil bitches and bastards threatening her.  The addition of Wynn Duffy or Constable Bob would be a treat.  The two characters I’d like to see least in any scenario are Loretta and Wynona.  Another point of interest for me is Boyd's military service. Maybe a story harking back to his decision to enlist vs the so-called "good guy" Raylan, choosing not to do so. Perhaps something angsty about that point in time, like a farewell scene before Boyd shipped out. 

Much as I came to love Ava, I'd rather not see a threesome fic, just because I feel Boyd somehow comes out second best and that just not want I want from Yuletide.

If you do go for hard-core slash, do not feel obliged to go particularly vanilla. These are bad boys and I’m happy to see them do bad things to each other, possibly in the name of not admitting that they really care.

Kennedys RPF 
John F. Kennedy (Kennedys RPF), Robert F. Kennedy (Kennedys RPF), Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (Kennedys RPF)

DNW-AU, MPREG. Not crazy about cross-overs unless otherwise noted.
Please no A/B/O/Omegaverse/knotting or associated aspects, tropes etc.
No JFK assassination theories that implicate Bobby.  Others are fine.

WOW! I was surprised and delighted to see this in the tagset. I've been in love with the Kennedys and the Camelot mystique as long as I can remember.  I've read about them compulsively, worked on Edward M. Kennedy's 1984 Primary campaign and got the privilege to shake his hand both that year and again in 1988.  

The only person I detest is Old Joe.  Feel free to villify him as much as you like. 

I love the beauty and glamour of the early 60's and the more I read about Jack and Bobby, even stuff that other people use to denigrate them, the more in love I am.

If we matched on these characters, just know that I'd be happy with almost any combination and arrangement.

Feel free to throw in other characters, such as any members of the Rat Pack, especially Peter Lawford (one of the tragedies, in his own way)  Judith Exner, other politicians and celebs of the day. 

I'm totally OK with any Jack/Bobby incest ideas you might have, and the need to hide it from the old man and the spouses, or the possibility that Jackie knows and understands...or knows and doesn't.
Bobby/Jackie--lust and longing on either part is fine.  I'd adore comfort sex after the assassination OR hate-sex at any point in time, or an on-going affair in the face of Jack's well-known infidelities.
If a threesome scenario, one-time or ongoing appeals to you: go for it.
Any thoughts about the brothers that Jackie has on the verge of marrying Onassis
I'm good with RFK in either his "Ruthless Bobby" or "Saint Bobby" phases.
Feel free to bring up the Addison's disease and the various drugs that Jack was on for the back pain at any time, including the fact (per Judith Exner Campell) that he was rather passive in bed due to the back injury.
References to Marilyn Monroe are fine....whether you believe she was screwing Jack or Bobby or both, or was eventually killed/screwed over by both/either/neither.  (Maybe Jackie got Peter Lawford to arrange for Marilyn's demise to protect her position and the family?)
Any wacky conspiracy theories are fine, EXCEPT anything that implicates Bobby in Jack's death.
Seriously...go to town.  I'm just happy to have great teeth, beautiful people and Brookline accents in one story.

Beverley (Learners (2007))

I really feel for Bev and her struggle towards something that is profoundly ordinary but so vital to her independence. I’d enjoy another slice-of-life moment. What does she tackle next? What else does she aspire to?

If you ship her with Chris, feel free to orchestrate circumstances that bring them back together. If you ship her with Ian, then I’d love a fic that helps demonstrate why Bev made the right choice in returning to him and her family. What makes Ian good for her?

Some possibilities for baby-fic: Beverley and Ian as grandparents. Bev and Ian babysitting for Chris and Fiona. Fiona’s out of town and Chris is alone with the baby for the first time and reaches out to Bev for help.

Lastly, feel free to include other members of the driving school. If Bev is keeping in touch, I’d enjoy a reunion or meet up for coffee.

The Decoy Bride (2011) 

I really adore this quirky little film. I love that they're all genuinely good people trying to find their own happiness. Generally speaking, I'm looking for a fic that captures the fluffiness and/or quirky humor of the source material.

If you’d like a prompt, here are a handful of things I’d love to see. But if you already had an idea in mind, feel free to go with it.

For an Iseabail-centric story, I’d love something set during Iseabail’s great adventure seeing the world. Either introspective or something with Katie would be great. Otherwise, more of Iseabail and Lara bonding together would be really sweet given that they clearly kept in touch.

Post-movie fluff for James and Katie is also good! Domestic fic; a proper date night; their wedding round two. I also adore holidays and wintriness if you want to do something seasonal.

For Lara, I’d just love to see more of her happy ending. A day on set, or maybe volunteering at a zoo somewhere with baby lions or cheetahs or leopards. While he’s not in the tag set, I also ship Lara and Marco if you’d like to write their romance. Or bring both couples together!

In other words, please feel free to include anyone else in the tagset: you have complete permission to follow your muse.

That said, I specifically requested Rufus because he’s so underused in fic. I love him for so many reasons: his devotion to loyalty, his emotional strength, his biting sense of humor. If you’d like a Rufus-centric prompt, I’d love introspection or ‘missing scenes’ after a mission that had particular significance for Rufus, such as meeting Wernher von Braun in 1944 or the trip to NASA. You’re welcome to also go pre-series, or to include Rufus’s family if that interests you.

Being Erica 

I'm super open in this fandom. I nommed four characters I’d be happy to read more of and am providing some general prompts, but if there's someone else you’d love to write, or you just want to do a bunch of world building about the mechanics of time travel therapy, then please go ahead.

For Sarah, I’d prefer fics that are either focused on before she left home, (and thus her relationship with Tom), or after she starts therapy with Erica. Please avoid her descent into depression and substance abuse.

For Tom, just about anything goes. I totally love him with Amanda if you want to go post-canon. Or you could explore his relationship with any of his other patients, or any kind of missing scene. I'm also interested in his time he spent as Naadiah’s patient. Which experiences were most formative in making him the doctor he is? I love the circular nature of therapy.

I nominated Erica with mostly post-series fic in mind: who does she become as a doctor? But if that is daunting, I’d love a story featuring any of her regrets from her list that we didn’t get to see. Something in the spirit of an episode anywhere during her timeline works!

For Sam, I’d be happy with some sisterly bonding time. I prefer Lenin over Josh if you want to write something more shippy. Missing moments fic would also be neat, or outsider POV on Erica and the changes she makes throughout the canon.

Major bonus points for including any Jewish holiday in whatever story you write.

My only DNW for this fandom is super dark and hopeless fics. Sad is fine, just retain a place for optimism.

Salvation (TV) 
Darius Tanz, Liam Cole

You don't need to include both Darius and Liam; consider this an or request.

That said, should you want to write something featuring both of them, I'm really intrigued by the dysfunctional father/son style relationship they have going on, especially given Darius’s equally fraught relationship with Nicholas. What's it like for Darius to be on the ‘dad’ side of the fence? How does Liam feel about such an authority in his life? I’d also be excited to see Darius meet Mrs. Cole for any reason, if you’d be up for including someone not in the tagset.

If you want to do something more shippy, I’m definitely all-in for Liam/Jillian at any point in the timeline. I ship Darius equally with Grace and Tess. Between the apocalypse, hostile corporate takeover, drugging, and waterboarding, Darius deserves a nice day for once.

I'm also interested in pre-series stuff for Darius. The tiny glimpses of his childhood in canon, leave me craving more for everything from his treehouse-dwell youth through his aborted relationship with Tess and ultimately building his empire. He also displays an above average level of compassion for the standard genius character: where does that come from?

For Liam, I’m mostly interested in what's going on in his head. So much is happening for him, yet he’s managing to not only save the world but also be there for his fiancée at the same time. What's he going through when no one is watching?

You don't need to include all of the women; consider this an or request. Also please feel free to include anyone else in the tagset: you have complete permission to follow your muse.  

I specifically requested Hannah, Alex, and Emily because although I love the way the canon writes women, it often doesn't have time for them in the midst of the latest national crisis.

Rather than specific prompts for each, I am interested in a lot of the same things. Potential pre-series fics: Alex and Tom’s courtship; Hannah’s early agent days; how Tom and Emily became friends. Or the moment of the bombing from any of their perspectives.

I’d also love any kind of day in the life or missing moment fic. Or just any combination of these women getting together and having Bechdel test passing conversation.

You don't have to include all of the characters if you do not want to. Preferably, I'd like something set when they're growing up inside the VFD because All the Wrong Questions did not do what I wanted it to do in regards to character development. If you want to write about Lemony post series then go for gold! If you want to write about Kit Snicket and Olaf's teenage love affair, go for it! If you want to write about Jacques feeling in the shadow of his siblings constantly, go for it. I just love the Snicket Siblings with my whole heart.

I also just find the whole VFD fascinating and would read a 13 book series about all of the exploits that happened when it was a thing before the schism.

Shades of Magic - V. E. Schwab 
Rhy Maresh, Holland Vosijk

Honestly, I just think Holland was the most fascinating character of the series and thought he was going to end up with Rhy. I'd like to read more about them interacting though, because I felt like they were sort of friends in the first book and then it never really touched on it again.

Kelly Jones, Annabelle Fritton, Chelsea Parker

BOY I LOVE THESE MOVIES. You don't have to write about all of them if you do not wish too and feel free to include as many of the other girls as you would like to. 

Some possible prompts: an AU where Annabelle never ended up at St Trinians but gets drawn into their orbit somehow anyway, where they go after they graduate, a 10 year highschool reunion (where they end up having to do something to save the world). I just love stories about friendship (but also feel free to make it as shippy as you feel like, I'm honestly happy with any ship with this lot I love them all.)

Belsomra "Cats and Dogs" Commercial 

I'd be happy to read about the individuals shown in the canon, or more broadly about the world. The wake and sleep animals could be pets, or companion animals with their own sense of self, or aspects of the human they're connected to. Or artificially made in some way. Maybe wake and sleep creatures made in other languages then English, or in different settings.

Life's Flame - Heather Alexander (Song)

Of the series I most enjoyed Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm, with its largely natural rather than supernatural or magical cures, and the various animal characters. This could be a fun one for crossovers or fusions, if that's a thing you enjoy writing. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle might have a difficult time curing, say, Stitch or young Simba.

Outlander Series - Diana Gabaldon

I'm especially interested in Brianna during the latter part of Drums of Autumn, and anything to do with being a mother. (I long assumed that she would leave Jem and return to her own time, so an alternate version of events around that would be amazing to get to read.) But a story touching on Brianna at any age from babyhood onward (I particularly was interested by the glimpses of Claire, Frank, and Bree in Voyager) to adulthood. I'm not so interested in ghosts, but do like the dream communication alluded to in later books.

In a relatively recent interview, Jane Fonda said that if we were to catch up with Judy and Violet today, they'd be married and Violet would be the CEO of a Silicon Valley company: I would love to read anything about how they get to that point.

Atomic Blonde (2017)

To start off, I do not want a fix-it story for this canon.  I'll talk a bit more about that in my letter (to avoid spoilers)!  I am happy for you to consider this an OR request, though, and write about just Lorraine or just Delphine.  I'd love a story that fleshes out either of them pre-film.  There’s not a lot of wiggle room, but something set during the film that expands what we saw of them would also be great.  And post-film - again, that'll be in my letter.  If you are a spy aficionado, this might be an interesting canon for a crossover: did Lorraine ever run into Judi Dench's M, whatever she was doing in the 80s?  Or Emma Peel?

Dunkirk (2017) 
Collins (Dunkirk), Farrier (Dunkirk)

If slash doesn't appeal, you could just side-step the slashy suggestions I've got, and write me gen about Collins finally reuniting with Farrier when the latter has made it back to base after escaping from Colditz and the two of them going for a pint.

Or, if you want to go slashy, you could go with the standard reunited after V-Day. So let’s say Farrier has carried the memory of Collins around with him through all the different Oflags all through the war. Maybe they had something going on even before the Operation Dynamo. Maybe they were just about to start, but got cut off because of the war. Maybe Collins has been oblivious all this time as to just how much Farrier feels for him, because he’s too busy hero-worshipping the older pilot. How do their differing experiences of war affect their relationship? Or, more smuttily - how do they celebrate the end of the war? Is it all just quick, frantic fumblings in the dark? Or is it something slower, and does Farrier take his time with Collins because he’s had to wait five years and he’s going to enjoy every second of the time they have together (and Collins is just frantic for him to finish)? I’ll leave the details to you. Just please, please no sad endings for the pilots. They’ve had to endure enough already.

Discuss musical influences (given that Jack would have just finished filming England is Mine not long before and there is photographic evidence of Jack listening to some choice tunes before filming)? Jack’s said a few times that Tom gave him some really good advice about his career, but is that all he gave him? This could be as gen as you want, dear author, or as smutty as you can make it. I’d be happy either way. You could also set it during the press junket for Dunkirk - how would the two of them react to seeing each other again?

AUs are fine as well, if you want to try that.

Peaky Blinders (TV) 

Alfie’s such a great personality - he adds that little element of unexpectedness (and also the swearing is hilarious) to proceedings on the show, so I’d like to see his background fleshed out a bit more. We all know that Alfie’s mother is Russian and that she had to flee Russia because she was Jewish. But what else is there to know about Alfie? How did he rise to become the Head Baker of his operation in Camden Town? What was his experience of the Great War like, and how would that have affected the man he’s portrayed to be in the show? What caused him to fall out with Sabini? 

If you wanted to pair him up with Tommy, that could be interesting (and hot), but I think I’d prefer a gen fic. Or you could invent some other lover, male or female - what kind of impression would they leave on a man like Alfie?

Versailles (TV 2015) 
Philippe d'Orléans | Monsieur (Versailles 2015), Louis XIV (Versailles 2015)

Whatever kind of relationship (slashy or not) between the brothers you would like is up to you. I’m just intrigued by the repercussions of Season 2 and how that’s changed the dynamic between Louis and Philippe. On the one hand, you have Philippe being brilliant in mimicking Louis during the meeting with the Indian ambassador. On the other, there is the fact that Philippe has literally put himself in danger for his brother (and oh, who could forget the Chevalier’s moment of heroics??). This relationship is all about Louis’ control and dominance over his younger brother and the way it has evolved over the past Season has been fascinating to watch, both in terms of Louis’ own insecurities and Philippe’s sacrifices. I’d like to see that explored a little more in fic. Does Louis reward his brother for what he’s done, as he did with the Chevalier? What form might that reward take? How would they deal with the aftermath of The Affair of the Poisons? How does Philippe respond to the threats against Louis’ life?

Uprooted - Naomi Novik 
Agnieszka (Uprooted), Kasia (Uprooted), Wood-queen (Uprooted)

I would be happy with a story that doesn’t include all of these characters.

Kasia's POV on any of the events from the book would be interesting. Maybe a future fic where Agnieszka and Kasia meet up again and have to learn about each other all over. A story set when they were kids, where Kasia notices how magical things tend to happen around Agnieszka.

The Wood-queen is a scary force of nature. Anything from her POV during the book events, a fic set in the past showing her life before, her time trapped in the tomb, or her escape.

Ships: Agnieszka/Kasia (I'd be really keen for angsty or sweet first-time fic set in that month right before the Dragon shows up. Or later fic where Agnieszka's magic could be used for sex. Kasia's really strong now, I'd love to see that strength also used during sex. For future fic I'd prefer the Dragon was just an ex-lover that Agnieszka hasn't seen in a long time.)

Wood-queen/Kasia, Wood-queen/Agnieszka, Wood-queen/Agnieszka/Kasia (I'm super okay with non-con/rape and dark fic with anything involving the Wood-queen. The fact that being trapped in a heart tree traps you in your head makes an interesting trope for all sorts of terrible kinky porn. 

Likes: Magic, Women wearing uniforms, breaking the rules, angry mobs, dark fic, non-con/rape, tentacles, mind rape, trapped in your own head.

DNWs: I do not want extreme damage, extreme pain, stockholm syndrome, vomit, or scat. (Watersports are okay but please no pee drinking.)

Product testing doesn't always go as planned. I'm interested in all the little ways Teddy is made to please the people in the park. What does his programming tell him to accept as okay? I liked the creepy way the techs would handle the robots. I'd love a fic about all the different times Teddy was aware while being fixed, reprogrammed, or shown off before he's made to forget. How many different stories has Teddy played a part in? How many people has he been?

Ships: Teddy/anyone: (Teddy spends a lot of time at the brothel, how does his programming handle him getting hit on? He comes in on the train with the guests. Is he programmed to help them even then? Do the guests take advantage of him? There's a lot of implied bad touch and rape/non-con, there are so many possibilities: from guests of the park, to the techs, to the other hosts. I'm more interested in m/m for this, but I'd also be okay with F/m.)

Likes: Tough men being emotional, Can't say no, shame/humiliation, memory wipes, repeating loops, non-con/rape, mind control, identity issues, aware but unable to move.

DNWs: I do not want mind break(robot programming issues are okay), stockholm syndrome, vomit, or scat. (Watersports are okay but please no pee drinking.)

(Your choice as to what, when, and just how terrible this meeting turns out to be.)

Possible Ships: Joey/Trizza (as an unhealthy relationship, with a side of xeno non-con, slavery, and maybe death(surprise me as to who ends up dying))

Likes: Things exploding, sparkles, snarking, sincerity, blood drinking, sluthing, fighting evil, smut, porn, non-con/rape, all the kinks, xeno. 

DNWs: I do not want extreme damage, extreme pain, mind break, stockholm syndrome, vomit, or scat. (Watersports are okay but please no pee drinking.)

Requested characters are OR rather than AND.   I prefer to see them in canonical relationships or gen.  See my letter for more details and ideas.  Here are a few prompts:
* Nomi/Amonita exploring some kink they haven't tried before. (Bonus if other cluster members are watching/participating/enjoying.)
* Show me Amanita finding out about the other people in Nomi's cluster, and how she came to accept that being with Nomi was joining that larger family.
* Lito/Hernando/Daniela reclaiming their sexuality and passion after being outed.
* Lito calling on his cluster for inspiration in prepping for a role or performing.
* Sun's cell-mates and cluster helping her adjust to life in prison.
* How about a crossover or fusion, with Sun's understanding and acceptance of herself as a sensate being informed by her experience of (insert compatible Korean fandom). Korean mythology? Ghosts of her ancestors? Vampires? Gumiho? I would be tickled pink if you introduced me to some supernatural K-drama or Manhwa source I'm not yet a fan of!

DNW: pregnancy, major character death, breaking up canonical relationships, unhappy endings.  Also, fics focusing on Whisper, Will's addiction, Wolfgang's imprisonment and torture, homophobia, or transphobia. Mentions of any of those are fine, to flavor the soup.

* D'Avin really does decide to 'holster that thing', on his brother's advice, and Pree (my favorite flaming fairy godfather) arranges a sex intervention with Dutch and whoever else you'd like him to invite.
* DirtyBadWrongHot Johnny/D'Avin The Company Made Them Do It incest fic (Dub-con where the boys can't help but be into it despite the taboo, rather than hard non-con, please.)
* Lucy learning about sex and intimacy through voyeurism of various pairings.
* Johnny/Lucy masturbation fic
* Pawter gently informs Johnny that, although she's been having fun with him, she hasn't been getting off. They enlist Pree's professional help.
* Hella kinky Dutch/Alvis. You know he'd be up for anything.
* D'Avin/Dutch banging each other when what they really need is intimacy.
* If you'd prefer to write gen, I'd like a story where the trust and loyalty between the three of them is tested.
* If you'd like to go darker than that, force these characters face-to-face with their worst fears about themselves. To me, that is the essence of horror.
* You could also show me any of the crew interacting with Alvis in his role as a monk or spiritual advisor - however reluctantly or ironically.  If you are into the Scarback monks, I'd also enjoy world-building around them, with or without any of my requested characters.

Ladyhawke (1985)

I'd like a story that explores a close relationship among the three main characters. I'd be delighted with threesome porn, but the relationship does not necessarily need to be sexual, or even romantic. A deep friendship would absolutely fit the bill.  See my letter for more details and ideas.  Prompts:
* Isabeau and Etienne's wedding day. Philippe thought he would be left behind; he was wrong.
* While cursed, Etienne asks Philippe to comfort Isabeau. Things get complicated.
* The curse has some unpleasant long-term effect on Etienne and Isabeau. Philippe helps.
* Isabeau retains her sense of self while transformed, and can hear and understand every word they say about her.
* Post-canon, Philippe is a respected page in their grand household, and carries the most private of messages between the lord and lady of the house as they go about their day. (You could go NC-17 with this one, or tease me with genteelly salacious epistolary fic.)
* After decades together, one of the three passes away. The other two have to readjust their relationship to fill in the gaps left behind by their beloved.
* The 'curse' was a metaphor all along. Tell me the version of this tale where a pretty young commoner boy aids a knight on a quest to open his heart. Only then will he be worthy of the lady who, assaulted by a man of the cloth, swore that no man would clip her wings.

Requested characters are OR rather than AND.  I'd prefer gen for this fandom. Feel free to go black-dark, if that's what you want, or share some light-hearted fun.  See my letter for more details. Prompts:
* Chief Napi is a Blackfoot trickster demigod. That's not sub-text. It's IN THE SCRIPT. Do with it what you will!
* Sameer lies so well because he started young. I'd love to see flashbacks to his childhood growing up in Morocco, trying to find work on the stage, and learning the fine art of the con.
* The whole team relaxing and drinking together, with some of that delightful culture clash between their expectations of women, and the reality that is Diana.
* Steve tries to explain to Diana how it's possible for the Great War to exist, without Ares forcing men to commit these horrors. Sameer, Chief, and Charlie each have their own ideas about good, evil, and the nature of mankind. They may or may not share them.
* Diana, Sameer, Charlie, and Chief gather one last time to remember Steve. They each bring something of their own traditions, and something of their own memories of him.

A Taste of Honey - Kai Ashante Wilson 

This is a last-minute addition, since I JUST read this fabulous novella.   See my letter for more impressions and details.  Possible prompts:
* Aqib growing into a stronger, more confident version of himself, rejecting the views of his home culture and family that shamed him for looking and acting different than a 'real man' should.
* Aqib/Lucrio, as they first return to Daluca. I'm fascinated by this m/m 'adoption' tradition they have.  It reminds me of a pirate's <i>matelotage</i>.  Show me more!
* Aqib's first time with Lucrio, full of body worship, joy, laughter, and tenderness.
* The Sybil's fragmented view of the many possibilities and probabilities as she sends Lucrio to Olorum to meet his love, anticipating his bitter tears.  This could take a lot of experimental forms, from verse to IFF.
* A story with Aqib (either version) exploring and enjoying his ability to communicate with animals.
* Femysade chose Aqib on the strength of watching him dance the sacred dance like only a woman could, and watching him play with Sabah like a child.  She wanted a man who was not a man, and it seems the two of them were close friends and occasional lovers for many years.  I would enjoy learning more about their relationship from her perspective.
* The Prophet 'god' Adonane didn't just come looking for Femysade.  She specifically needed <i>LucretiaAqibFemysade</i> - the Femysade who had married Aqib and given birth to Lucretia.  I wonder why.  Perhaps your story can show me.
* World-building of any and all kinds, including OC's, epistolary fic, sacred art and scripture, an introduction to the standard text on the ethics of psionics, or a scientific study of the breeding experiment that is the Sacred Cousins of Olorum. (One possible explanation for why homosexuality is so violently blasphemous.)

Damnatio Memoriae Series - Laura Giebfried 

Do Not Wants: Porn. I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side.

I got really emotionally invested in this series, and was sad (but not really surprised) that is has no fic. There were certainly lots of things I wanted to read about when I’d finished the series!

Since I’m requesting any, here are some prompts:

-Fix it fic for book 3? It’s rare that I want fix it fic, but seriously, can there be a miraculous rescue at the end or something? Or Jack and Enim manage to break out. Or Enim can somehow get in touch with Karl. Everything has gone so wrong by the end, and just changing a few things might make things a bit happier! Speaking of fix it fic, you could split earlier and avoid the whole Karl and Enim not being on speaking terms thing (-that’s- the one unforgiveable thing Enim did? They actually seemed to be getting on okay too, so it’s startling; I could totally imagine book 1 Karl and Enim agreeing to never speak again). 

-This series is rather fixated on Enim’s viewpoint, but I’d be very curious what he looks like from the outside, as well as other things going on in other characters lives. I’d like to see Jack’s view of that year (even if his sights are firmly fixated on Miss Mercier rather than his dormmate). I’m very interested in the schizophrenia storyline and anything involving that would make me happy.

-Speaking of point of view fic, I’d like to see Karl and Beringer’s interactions and views on what’s going on. Karl knows something is going badly wrong… does he communicate it to Beringer? Do either of them ever talk properly? But Beringer speaks to Enim as if he thinks he’s perfectly fine, just suffering from his guilt. Is that correct, or a front for Enim? Seriously, I’d love to see some of the backstory of this as Enim’s behaviour becomes more and more eratic yet nobody is stopping to say, “Hm, that’s not right.” 

-Back story! How did Jack and Enim meet? Let’s see a bit of younger Jack, actually; he can’t have been so rebellious for seven years or he’d have been kicked out. A character study on Jack in general would be great. 

-More back story! Let's see the Christmas where it all went wrong, or even years before. Enim's broken family fascinates me and I'd like to see it a bit more on screen  than it is in the books. 

-I liked that Enim almost saw Beringer as a friend; just one who was paid to spend time with him. I wouldn’t mind seeing a bit more of some of their sessions. Alternately, I wish his brief ghostly appearance in book 2 had been a little longer, since I felt it was very interesting and would like to see his role expanded. 

If none of these ideas are the sort of thing you want, feel free to go your own way, as ever; I’d just be happy with any fic existing for this fandom!


Request 2 by Khantael
Root Double: Before Crime After Days 

Do Not Wants: Porn. I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side.

What I like about Root Double is its similarity to series such as Zero Escape. I still think Route After is great in particular, though I don’t dislike any of the routes. Shout out to Route Current too which I think is greatly underappreciated, but I love a good point of view switch and Current may as well be called “Route After Revisited: Point of View Switch”, haha. 

I’ll link the opening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdwKxuogBbk

Anyway, I’ve requested any as I would be happy with any of the four nominated characters. It’s a little hard to prompt when requesting any, so I’m just going to throw out a load of ideas now:

-I mentioned above that I love a good point of view switch. I’d like to see Louise (Salyu)’s view of Route After. We know what Watase and crew do, and Natsuhiko and Mashiro are both accounted for, but we see very little of Salyu and what she’s doing particularly as she believes the radiation story. She’d also have a very different perspective of being trapped to the others because she knows there are other dangers there far before anybody else does, and she’s also totally lost track of her friends.

-In Route Double, Natsuhiko suffers ill effects from his removing the malice from other people. What if he really did end up getting inflicted with the Malice himself or otherwise just got more severe (more permanent?) effects from what he’s doing. (He’s messing with people’s minds, fighting a very strong opposing force, yet there doesn’t seem to be a long term implication from this and I think there should be.) I’d like to see how this could affect him in the long term (and how Salyu and Mashiro would respond). In the “stricken by Malice” chaos, there may not be a long term!

-I’d like to see Mashiro given a bigger role. She has a good role in Route Before, as well as a strong friendship, then she’s unconscious throughout Route After and still barely present in the later routes. She’s a Level 5 communicator! She may not be able to do Senses Sympathy (although I guess this could develop in the infected area of Labo), but she she’s still more experienced with Empathy and general Communicator skills than Natsuhiko is, even if his ability is higher. Let’s see Mashiro being awesome please! 

-Watase was a fascinating character to me. I’d like to see the different stages of Watase if you like: the young, kind Watase; grieving terrorist Watase; Malice inflicted Watase; amnesiac Watase and then the Watase who comes out of Natushiko’s Senses Sympathy repair. I’m particularly interested in the latter two or three. To have your sense of self change so rapidly could make for some very interesting reading.

-Any additional events you want to throw into the Route After/Route Double time frames! More/drama/excitement/friend is always welcome! (Probably more the Route Double timeframe with this combination of characters, mind…)

-An extension of the ending where Watase and Natsuhiko go together to the terrorist organisation; I’m interested by the two interacting and their obviously different sets of morals. How exactly would this work?

-Mashiro’s point of view of the first LaBO incident and Natushiko’s unconsciousness; particularly interested in his awakening and obvious delusions and a more broad view of how exactly she dealt with that situation. 

-Salyu interacting with Natsuhiko and Mashiro in general. I really liked Salyu! Alternately, it could be her keeping running into Watase again during the events of the game, although I imagine this would be considerably less friendly. Does she ever start buying into his personality change or just believe it's a lie for the entire time anyway? Given her inability to understand emotions, there's lots of scope for misunderstandings which I'd find interesting! 

As always, if you don’t like the ideas, go your own way and I’ll be happy just to have some fic for this fandom!


Request 3 by Khantael
Warchild Series - Karin Lowachee 
Jos Musey, Ryan Azarcon, Yuri Kirov

Do Not Wants: Porn. I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side. No Yuri/Estienne in particular please!

Warchild is my absolute favourite series of books and I love that it's getting more fic now (in Yuletide season anyway)! :) I love that the books are all narrated by different characters because then we get to see them all interacting with eachother with new eyes (my favourite parts of Burndive are Jos and Ryan's interactions for instance; Jos is so quiet but broody in Warchild, so having a character see him without the context of his thoughts was extremely interesting to me). I like that the POVs are from very different sides of the war even though they all end up in one place in the end. I love Macedon and its crew. I reread these book at least once a year and always find something new to enjoy!

This is your explicit permission to not have to write about all three of the characters that I've requested, write about just one or two if you'd prefer (the prompts also don't necessarily include all 3 characters).

Prompts:

-Anything set post-Cagebird getting to see the characters interacting on Macedon. I'm particularly interested in Yuri's interactions with Jos (both being former proteges but extremely different) and Ryan (is it friendly? is it bitter? What's going on there?) but frankly any of the rest of the crew interacting with Yuri would make me extremely happy too. I'd also love to see Yuri's reaction to finding out who actually killed Falcone...! Basically, anything about Yuri on Macedon would make me grin away!

-Wasn't the plan to potentially eventually let Yuri reunite with surviving members of his family (even if it has to be under guard)? Would be quite interested in seeing that explored given that Yuri has changed massively since his childhood; he doesn't even really use the same name any more. Could be a good way to do a sort of outsider POV character study of Yuri. (I love my character studies, haha.) Bonus points if Jos is in the guard accompanying him.

-Anything about Jos and Ryan's less antagonistic relationship by the end of Burndive would be welcome, too. Doesn't matter in what capacity. Actually, the scene where Jos brought Ryan aboard Turundrlar was quite interesting, so might be interesting seeing Ryan have to take more steps into that world of striviirc-na and start having to work through his prejudice. That has to start somewhere, and he seems to generally be forgiving Jos for being a symp at that point.

-On one of my later rereads of Warchild, I found myself wondering whether the brigs had optics or not. They probably do. I would actually be quite curious to see Ryan somehow get ahold of that archive footage and seeing some of the times Jos got stuck in brig (or Yuri, they're the big two really who we know spent a bunch of time in brig... Evan's the only other person we really know who ended up in there). It mostly occurred to me because Azarcon lets Ryan get away with quite a bit that he wouldn't let his recruits do, so that in itself could be an interesting lens on Azarcon's more ruthless leadership style as well as some insight into Jos or Yuri. (He could definitely have used more insight into Jos during Burndive, haha.)

-Would also be quite happy to see some of Jos' experiences as a known symp and former spy on board Macedon, because we don't see too much of his point of view during that time frame in Warchild, then of course we take Ryan's POV in Burndive... People certainly aren't subtle about it!

-An AU of sorts where Ryan wasn't shot at and so didn't end up on Macedon/start learning more about the war. How would that work? Would the later events still happen and Macedon still go rogue (since that was ultimately over shutting the station down to rescue Ryan)? He has tended to believe everything the Send has said about aliens at this point, so what's he going to make of his father trying to instate the peace process when he very firmly doesn't believe in and is ultimately untouched by the war except for his traumatising experience down on Earth? And where does Yuri come into it in this timeframe?

-Ryan is a bit suspicious of the way Azarcon treats Jos a few times in Burndive (even comments that Jos looks like him!), so would love to see fic where Ryan wonders if Jos is actually a sibling of his from some sort of intergalactic affair! I've always wondered this... especially since Azarcon even invites Jos to that family (plus Sid!) meal, haha.

If you want to include other characters (in the tag set or not) I'm happy with that, everyone needs more love.

If none of this sounds interesting, go your own way with one or more of the requested characters and I'll be very happy. :)

I'm not up to date on the Patreon stuff, but I don't mind if you include references.

Bad Boy - Diana Wieler 
A.J. Brandiosa, Tulsa 'Tully' Brown, Summer Brown

Basically, I have a whole lot of questions about Tully and A.J.'s future, starting with: what would it take to get A.J. to a place where he would want Tully to break his promise to never let him find out if he actually likes guys? What would make Tully willing to do so? Would A.J. need to take a test run with somebody he had less history with before he could even think about Tully like that again? Could any of this happen while they continued to play hockey? Or would A.J. need to do something like go to university or get a job in a more liberal part of the country before anything could change? Does Tully have a way out of Moose Jaw on his own - or might he find himself stuck there? How would their families react if they found out? Really, make it as complicated for them as you like, but if you could give them at least a hopeful ending that would be preferable.

Is the big city all it's cracked up to be, or does she find herself missing where she came from more than she expected to? How does she feel about dancing in city clubs - and the whole club scene? Might any of that lead to her exploring her sexuality a little more (I mean, if Rusty weren't so gone on Willard…)?* Can she come back home after that?

Explicit sex (allusions to sex or situations that get kind of steamy are okay, just...keep it teen rated or lower, please). It’s also probably best to avoid AUs (unless otherwise specified) or unrequested crossovers.

Pod Save America (RPF) 
Tommy Vietor (Pod Save America RPF), Jon Lovett (Pod Save America RPF), Jon Favreau (Pod Save America RPF)

- I’d love to read an AU - historical, supernatural, alternative jobs, alternative timelines, all are great
- If you’re someone who likes writing porn and/or kinkfic, that one time Lovett said “pretty people telling me what to do is basically my work life and my home life” is DEFINITELY something that could be explored more in fic 
- Office sex! White House sex! Accidental voyeurism! 
- In general I would LOVE classic trope fics in this fandom
- For OT3 prompts I love “two people team up on the third” stories, and “two people are together and the third gets involved”. 
- Tour fic! Maybe inspired by recent twitter posts about sharing a bed

I don’t have a lot of hard squicks or triggers, but things I tend to enjoy less are: character death (unless it’s canon), mpreg, omegaverse, issuefic, noncon, incest and heavy underage. Not into crossovers, but I do enjoy fusion AUs.

Freestyle Love Supreme 
Lin-Manuel Miranda (Freestyle Love Supreme), Christopher Jackson (Freestyle Love Supreme)

I would LOVE fic which follows on from the episode “What makes a hombre”. Lin asks lots of people in a park what makes a real man, and they give various answers, and he flirts a lot and then wanders away without having solved the conundrum of how to make Latino men vote. WHAT IF, as part of this investigation Chris (a supportive, if bemused, friend) showed Lin his dick. Could this help him get closer to the answer? Seems unlikely but YOU NEVER KNOW. 

So one route you could take would be to write fic within the show’s universe, which would be GREAT, and another would be to write... irl RPF? which would ALSO be amazing - this group is clearly so essential and formative to everyone who’s a part of it - they got tattoos together! Went on tour to Australia and the Edinburgh Fringe! Any fic about this part of their life would be great. 

I just nominated these two because it’s the only pairing I really ship, but if you want to include Anthony, UTK, Daveed or others that would be awesome! If you don’t ship anything I would also enjoy fic about the group’s formation, or an episode style fic about them fucking around in New York. 

Or you could go for something totally out there - Bodyswap! Superhero AU!

The Golden Gate - Vikram Seth 
Ed Dorati, Phillip "Phil" Weiss

1. Fic set during the early stage of their relationship - so, it’s pretty clear that however doomed Ed and Phil’s relationship might be, the sex is great. I’d love to read a version of their first time that the book politely skips over. Or if writing porn isn’t your thing, fic that gets in their heads while they’re still getting to know each other. What’s going through Ed’s mind when he goes to church, before he comes back determined to tell Phil they can’t be together? 

2. Some kind of canon-divergent AU - what if, when they’re lying in bed after their massive fight, one of them reached for the other? Ed’s commitment to abstinence, while it falters a lot, is so deeply held that it’s hard to see him compromising on that, but if they decided to keep going and try to make it work after all their differences were exposed and that ugliness was out in the open, would does it look like? Maybe it works out, maybe it just takes longer to fall apart. 

3. Post-canon fic/future fic - OKAY, SO THE ENDING. To me the last quarter of this book feels like the season finale of a tv show, where suddenly all the conflict that’s been slowly brewing goes into overdrive, various tragedies occur and all the main relationships are reshuffled and you’re like, wait, what, those two? I can see why, but also, NO! WHAT! 

Phil and Liz rush into marriage with three cats and three kids and manage to convince their exes, neither of whom are IN ANY WAY over their last relationship, to stick around and be part of their lives. It is SUCH a bizarre situation.

I’d love to see fic of Phil and Ed trying to navigate this awkwardness in the immediate aftermath, or two decades in the future, when Phil is a two time divorcee, his and Liz’s kids are heading off to college, and the loneliness of the intervening years has worn down Ed’s objections to intimacy. Or something totally different! There are so many ways this could go. Feel free to write angst or a happy ending, whichever you prefer.

4th Man Out (2015) 
Adam (4th Man Out), Chris (4th Man Out)

I think this is such a delightful, fun movie! I love the four best friends and their dynamic, and I have to be honest: I fully thought Adam and Chris were going to get together at the end of the movie. And when they didn't, my brain exploded with ideas for how they could get together, after all! I love how loyal they are to each other and how insistent Chris was that their relationship won't change after Adam's coming out, even though he's a little unsure about it. These two feel like such real best friends, and one of my favourite things is watching best friends fall in love. So let them be in love!

There are lots more details and prompts in my letter!

I was introduced to Falsettos through last fall's Broadway revival, and I have just fallen head over heels for the whole thing.

I'm completely smitten with Marvin and Whizzer's story, with all of its ups and downs, and would love to see fic for the two of them once they get back together again in Act 2. Exes getting back together definitely doesn't usually go smoothly, but we do get to see these two happy for a brief period of time. I want to know what it was like for them to fall back in love!

American Gods (TV) 
Media (American Gods (TV))

I would really love some world-building around Media's character and her backstory, her own version of the "Coming to America" scenes we get in the series if you will. It could be really interesting to see her in her early days as a kind of scrapper, when no one really anticipated how powerful she would one day become. What was it like to emerge as a goddess of media--when did it happen? Is she older than radio?  What it is it like for her to not have a fixed graven image like the old gods. Do you think she ever feels envy at her lack of traditional shrines or feast days? Please feel free to include any and all the celebrity cameos/meetings you wish. 

If you want to write shipfic, I ship her with Easter. The scenes between them just scream girlfriends. I’d love to know their backstory and what draws them together. Maybe a bit of their history or a scene showing how they patch things up after the series finale of s1. I'd also be open to Bilquis/Media or Media meeting characters like Sam Black Crow that haven't shown up yet in the tv canon.

Oh Martha. Poor poor Martha, she's my favorite, she gives me all the delicious angsty feels. I'd really love to see her relationship with "Clark" from her POV, especially her thought process at that moment when she knows he isn't who he says he is but she decides to aide and abet him anyway. How did she come to that decision? How does she rationalize it? 

Another possible idea--tell me about her time in Russia and her potentially happy ending with the orphan girl she plans to adopt at the end of the last season. It would be extremely gratifying to see Martha finally get some well deserved happiness after all she's been through. 

If you're up for it, I'd also be interested in seeing an AU where Phillip and Elizabeth find a way for Martha to stay and keep working as an asset. I'm especially open to a Phillip/Elizabeth/Martha ot3 in this scenario.

River (TV 2015) 
Jackie "Stevie" Stevenson, John River

Oh this show gives me all the feels! And it’s a perfect gem of a story, but greedy fan that I am, I can’t help wanting just a little bit more. I love River and Stevie’s partnership and the unrequited love between them. It really feels like their relationship was based on hard-won mutual respect. Stevie, especially, just kills me. I’d love a pre-canon story that explores River and Stevie’s partnership, something that reveals Stevie as the brilliantly alive and courageous person she must have been. Maybe a story about their first meeting or the case where they first clicked as a team? Or showing some of those moments when the UST between them bubbled to the surface and nearly boiled over? Stevie POV would be grand. 

If you’d rather write something post-canon, I guess I wonder if River ever sees Stevie again from time to time. Maybe she pops back up again to guide him through a difficult case? It would be interesting to see her pop up and lend her commentary as he learns to connect with more people like Rosa, Chrissie, etc.

I’d just love more moments like that between them—maybe some kind of mutually beneficial scheming and sexytimes? Or perhaps their rivalry could turn passionate? It could be really amazing to see them both team up against a mutual foe--and boy would I ever feel sorry for that person!

I was fairly disappointed with the game's development of Vasco and Cicero's relationship. The hints of the past, the fact that Vasco helps fairly easily, how Vasco SALTS for Cicero without any real resolution seemed like a missed opportunity (unless they fleshed this out in NG+ which I haven't played yet?). Not to mention how did Cyrus fit into it? I'd just REALLY like to see the relationship fleshed out and questions answered. Slash or gen is fine; I'd honestly be happy with either so long as their relationship is heavily featured in the story.

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 
Eugenides (Queen's Thief), Costis (Queen's Thief), Kamet (Queen's Thief), Eddis (Queen's Thief)

You know, we have yet to meet any of Gen's brothers and sisters, of which he has more than one of each, as near as I can tell. A little family life? His father? (who loved him enough to try his damndest to kill his son rather than see him tortured to death at her hands...) What must they think of Attolia?

Again, I love any eye on Gen, especially Attolia, Eddis or Phresine, and I am eager to see him loafing around or plotting against other kingdoms. 

Also, if you have a little Costis/Aris lying around somewhere, I would like to see it. Those cuties. EXCEPT THAT SINCE THICK AS THIEVES I AM 100% ON BOARD WITH COSTIS/KAMET PLEASE AND THANK YOU. 

I love temple stories, so feel free to sing me a song of the gods! Attolia telling Gen a story (in bed in the afterglow), Aris telling Costis a story (that leads to bed), Phresine telling a story to someone's children... before bed. I feel sure Eddis and Sophos will have a million adorable kiddos and Attolia and Gen. Well. That child will have her ears full of tales from the very cradle, won't she?

Secret History - Donna Tartt 
Henry Winter, Camilla Macaulay, Francis Abernathy, Charles Macaulay

More background info on anyone, pre- or during the events of the book - anyone except RICHARD. Ugh. Richard. That fuckin' guy. Henry is a great favorite, but Francis would have so many tales, and there’s something darkly funny about poor Charles being driven to drink as “the normal one”; he must have been beside himself trying to be cool while Henry chose which books to carry to make a good impression on the cops. Charles has for sure been on the wrong side of the law-probably for underage drinking, I would think. Or petty theft. He strikes me as a kid who took what he wanted, shortage of pocket money or no. And Camilla, being his look out or his lawyer or his designated liar, promising to keep an eye on him, to keep him out of trouble, when he’s stolen the gum for her, the charm bracelet, the pregnancy test.

If you're more of a Ben Affleck/Matt Damon person, they did do a few Kevin Smith movies together (Dogma, that Good Will Hunting 2 bit in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) so that would work fine within the prompt.&nbsp; Kevin having to watch their incessant flirting would be awesome.

19th Century American Medicine RPF 
Alexis St. Martin (19th Century American Medicine RPF), William Beaumont (19th Century American Medicine RPF)

You could go a lot of ways with this fandom and I would love all of them. I'm really interested in the basic building blocks comprising these two historical figures and their relationship, and you could build all sorts of different fiction on top of that. A lot of the keyword ideas I came up with are on the darker side but rest assured I would also love fluff. I'm just really into the idea of "doctor puts in considerable special effort to save patient, patient heals in a gross weird fashion ripe for medical experimentation, they fall into a long complicated entanglement with various power imbalance issues." They were both married irl but I don't care whether you keep that in a fic or change it.

Some ideas: power imbalance, medical experimentation, language barrier, class difference, codependency, weird historical medicine, dubious ethics, guro, body horror, erotic wound fingering, wound fucking, pining, florence nightingale effect, stockholm syndrome, unrequited feelings, obsession, legal/financial abuse, psychological abuse, medical abuse, gaslighting, in denial about feelings, repressed feelings, secret relationship, epistolary, historical, setting AU, moral quandaries, romance, porn, religious hangups, sexual hangups, cultural differences, hubris, odd couple relationship, dubcon, noncon, coercion, trapped together, physical vulnerability

Or prompts:
-Weird medical details: go nuts. I love guro &amp; gross stuff.
-Falling in love with repressed feelings/religious hangups/etc., especially if their power imbalance is still fraught in many ways
-Repressed feelings from one or both of them that are never fully expressed
-Beaumont becoming drunk with power and obsession and using his resources to control St. Martin every way he can, go as abusive/noncon as you like.
-Something focused on the contract Beaumont has Alexis sign to obey him in every way
-Something set during the time they're holed up together for months in that Washington D.C. hotel room
-Beaumont actually succeeded in taking Alexis with him to Europe
-Things go differently between them after Beaumont's book is published. Maybe Alexis doesn't leave. Or they exchange letters. Or later in life he comes back.
-If you want to change the setting, that's fine. Maybe an "In Space" AU of some kind? Another possibility if changing the setting is to change the nature of Alexis's wound. Maybe he can't die and Beaumont does horrific vivisection experiments on him?

モブサイコ100 | Mob Psycho 100 
Kageyama "Mob" Shigeo, Kageyama Ritsu, Reigen Arataka

Mob is my absolute favorite in this series. I love everything about him and how he's developed over time, making friends and becoming able to more freely express his emotions and getting stronger with the body improvement club. I love his relationships with both Reigen and Ritsu, and I ship all possible subsets of these three characters. I love the complicated brother relationship between Mob and Ritsu and the recent updates in chapter 100 have been killing me. Both of them care so much about and look up to each other, even with the baggage that has existed between them in the past. I also love the mentor/student relationship between Reigen and Mob, how Reigen helped Mob so much even though he has no powers himself, and how they got to the point they're at now, especially past the separation arc, where maybe Mob doesn't need Reigen in that same way anymore but their relationship has gained a bit more give-and-take. And! Reigen and Ritsu are great too, especially Ritsu's distrust and jealousy of Reigen. I really enjoyed that omake recently where they went on a job together and Reigen's arm got bitten.

If you write RitsuMob it's okay if Reigen doesn't appear in the fic (though he'd still be welcome). Otherwise I'd like all three characters. In ReiMob if there's fucking I prefer Mob getting fucked. I prefer something set at their canon ages or in the past, and if you do age Ritsu or Mob up please don't go past high school. If you want to involve other supporting characters I mostly like the other kids from Mob's school.

Some ideas: casefic, humor, shipfic, incest, age difference, underage, canon divergence, getting together, christmas, hot springs, valentine's day, romance, fluff, WAFF, porn, dubcon, crossdressing, sickfic, genderswap, bodyswap, 5 times/things, getting together, dating someone without them realizing it, obliviousness, body worship, slutty/needy sex, awkward sex, threesomes, sex pollen, slice of life, shopping, family, crushes, love confessions, repressed feelings

Or prompts:
-Humorous casefic, Ritsu helping Reigen and Mob out with a job maybe
-Romantic holiday fic (any holiday they'd potentially canonically celebrate)
-Getting together fic with a lot of bumps along the way
-Cute missing scenes of sibling interaction (with or without incest) between Mob and Ritsu
-Canon divergence from the car crash where Mob goes into a coma instead (with coma sex?)
-Encountering weird new psychic abilities
-What those orbs the aliens gave the telepathy club are for
-An AU that changes how the psychic powers work
-Something set after the current arc involving what a future arc might be (something more with the government's control of psychics maybe?)
-I've been curious about ways to combine ABO and Mob Psycho 100, so if you're into ABO feel free to go there. I'm more interested in heats/cum/porn and less in strict societal roles/hierarchies, and am also particularly curious about subversions of the ABO system, like pairings that aren't alpha/beta, or unusual threesome situations, etc. 
-Mob Psycho 100 baseball (feel free to incorporate the MobPuz outfits if you're familiar with them)
-Reigen or Ritsu cleaning/bathing Mob
-Possibly depending on how the current arc continues, something about the relationship between Mob, Ritsu, and ???%

Ookiku Furikabutte | Big Windup! 
Haruna Motoki, Mihashi Ren

Haruna is my favorite character and I love Mihashi as well (he's my shipping town bicycle of Oofuri). I love Haruna's physique, his dedication to his team and his training, his earnest but sometimes self-absorbed personality, and his awkward innocence that shows through in moments like his crush on that team manager senpai of his. I love Mihashi's determination and how hard he works even when his anxiety and low self-esteem hold him back, his love of baseball, and how he's found a team where he finally belongs. I also really love how both these characters and the cast of Oofuri in general are portrayed as realistic teenage boys and talk about stuff like what they jerk off to and how Mihashi is circumcised. XD I'm really interested in how Mihashi and Haruna are important/intriguing/attractive to each other. And I love how Haruna is canonically able to understand Mihashi pretty well right off the bat (to Abe's chagrin). I do ship them and would love shipfic too, whether awkward romantic fluff or some PWP porn. I'm also fine with either of them also having feelings for other characters (like Abe or Akimaru) though I don’t want a fic that just focuses on some other ship.

Some ideas: getting together, first time, first kiss, friends with benefits, casual sex, sexting/phone sex, didn't realize they were already dating, watching/looking at porn together, horny teenage boys, baseball, pitching practice, playing catch, training, going on a date, muscle touching/worship, size kink, held down, misunderstood feelings, nurse cosplay/roleplay, sex in public, spur-of-the-moment sex, embarrassment, awkward sex, hero worship, praise kink, bodyswap, WAFF

Or prompts:
-Haruna helps Mihashi with his pitching mechanics or training schedule (after finally contacting him through Abe)
-Mihashi wants to touch Haruna's muscles again and Haruna likes it, even if he doesn't understand why he likes it
-Haruna being way more of a clueless loser about his own developing feelings than Mihashi is great. As well as Mihashi being more experienced sexually (I kind of headcanon him and Tajima as friendly handjob buddies haha), or just having more exposure to porn/etc
-Meeting by chance in a bathroom again sometime in the future
-A futurefic of their next game (practice or actual) against each other

ちはやふる | Chihayafuru 
Ayase Chihaya, Mashima Taichi, Sudou Akito, Suou Hisashi

My request was inspired by recent manga chapters which have really highlighted two character relationships that weren't that developed before: Chihaya &amp; Sudou, and Taichi &amp; Suou. Although I requested all four characters I would be happy with fic for either of those two pairs.

Chihaya &amp; Sudou: I was kind of into this as a crack pairing before when their main interactions were Sudou occasionally sadistically taunting Chihaya, but lately they've actually been hanging out and training together and I'm so into it! Chihaya is my favorite character in the series and I love everything about her. She's so earnest and passionate and kinda dumb and just the perfect sports manga protagonist, haha. I always enjoyed Sudou and his sadism from early on as well but it feels like he's become more of a fleshed-out character lately. I've really enjoyed all the scenes of them training together and how Chihaya no longer just takes Sudou's shit but dishes it out as well. They have some of my favorite banter between any two characters, and I liked how they had an increased awareness of each other and some silent communication going on in the match in recent chapters. I could dig this as either a kind of "bros" dynamic, or UST or porn would also be great.

Taichi &amp; Suou: Their relationship has been in development for a bit longer. I absolutely flipped my shit when Taichi started his whole thing with imitating the way that Suou does everything. I have long loved Taichi and his warring impulses to be good/polite/etc and that underlying pettiness and competitive drive. With Suou, I especially dig those moments where he gets kind of silly (like considering any girl who talks to him a potential "bride"). I REALLY love both of their karuta playing styles. I also dig this as porn, or the two of them having more interactions like in canon, especialy if Suou takes digs at Taichi for trying to be things he's not. (And I love it when Taichi tries to be super cool and emotionless and then ends up embarrassed/flustered about something.)

Some ideas: training regimens, karuta matches, odd couples, banter, arguments, UST, roleplaying, dares, embarrassment, stubbornness, casual sex, friendship, confused feelings

Or prompts:
-Okay, the current plot arc (ch186 as of the scanlations) is KILLING me with all the Chihaya, Sudou, and Taichi drama. And even though Suou isn't physically there he's present through Taichi as well as Sudou's desire to beat him. This may all be resolved by the time fics go live but I'd love a fic exploring more of this kinda stuff.
-Further scenes from Chihaya &amp; Sudou training together, especially if it leads into some UST (or resolved). Ditto for Taichi and Suou.
-Taichi trying to do everything the way Suou does it has to include how he jerks off
-Futurefic of Sudou and Chihaya after she's graduated high school. Maybe they have some UST as high schoolers but something happens as adults?
-Suou and Taichi and their mutual dislike of karuta

- CHIDI/ELEANOR.  Specific ideas include anything that involves: a secret relationship or getting together or their first time or being forced to share a bed or remembering their whole past or anything porny or whatever happened in the specific reboot that led up to and came after the "I love you" tape from Dance Dance Resolution.
- Michael/Eleanor -- in the vein of that secretive in-this-together eyeroll at the end of Team Cockroach, and their easy banter during that fake orientation where finally they're interacting truthfully
- Jason/Janet - everything about them together is GOLD
- Janet gen or Jason gen - what do either of them do all day?

The Country of Ice Cream Star - Sandra Newman 

Would die of joy for ANYTHING in this fandom, but here are a couple ideas!

- Pasha/Ice Cream - a little, a lot, one-sided longing, totally reciprocated ... <i>anything</i>, man
- What happens next, after the book ends?
- anything from the POV of a non-Ice Cream character: Pasha or El Mayor or Mamadou or First Runner, etc..

Seraphina - Rachel Hartman 

SERAPHINA/GLISSELDA/KIGGS.  Anything about their basically-canon OT3, but a few ideas:
- the dynamics between the three of them
- how they got together (porny or not)
- smut (especially first time)

Alternately..... something hinting around the edges of inappropriate feelings between Orma and Seraphina??

Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - J.K. Rowling 
Gormlaith Gaunt (Ilvermorny), Rionach Steward (Ilvermorny)

Short version prompts:

You don't have to write fic with both of them.

Gormlaith and Rionach: Gormlaith raising and/or corrupting Rionach, can certainly be messed up intergenerational femslash incest (dubcon/noncon is fine)

Rionach: Parselmouth/Slytherin heritage, her relationship with her mother and sister, teaching at Ilvermorny, the Horned Serpent, Slytherin's wand + tree

Gormlaith: Dark magic adventures and traditions, Slytherin artifacts and ideology, childhood at Hogwarts

DNW: For Gormlaith/Rionach, I would prefer Rionach to be at least 16+.
