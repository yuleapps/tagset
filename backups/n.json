I'd be interested in Çiçek/Ceyda if Ceyda goes for Çiçek rather than Pala, if they meet that time Çiçek comes to talk to Yasemin or during one of the times Ceyda comes to the Baldar house.

What Damen does actually accomplish, of course, is a close alliance with Vere, which he thinks no matter how he might try to explain, Theomedes would not understand. Veretian voices in his halls! His son besotted! Even Makedon of the sensible views about Vere won over! \n\nI'd love to have Theomedes deal with the changes in his son, whether directly related to Laurent's presence in his life or less so. I feel like the changes in Damen are all linked at least tangenially to Laurent anyway, so even if the primary focus is on Kastor's betrayal or policy changes implemented by Damen, I will be happy. I would also be interested in something about policies Damen might implement that go against/undo what Theomedes was pursuing in the same matter, especially in minor matters, and how he might feel deliberately undoing his father's work. \n\nI'd also love to see some interaction between Theomedes and Laurent. What might that relationship look like? What could make Theomedes at least somewhat reconciled to Laurent's presence in Damen's life? I'm happy for the way they might be brought to meet to be handwaved and I'm not fussed about it: I'd be happy for some supernatural encounter like Theomedes being brought back to life (via some magical object they encounter on Progress around the country?) whether normally or in a Comes Back Wrong situation where he's not quite Theomedes but it's not immediately apparent, or a time travel AU where D/L try to change things (like stopping the events of Marlas?), or maybe Kastor's coup worked differently and only put Theomedes in a coma, or even to have Theomedes appear in a dream.\n\nLetter: http://deathsblood.dreamwidth.org/2098.html\n\n\n"

But if you're writing an incest fic, I would prefer it to not contain that much of Khaireddin, as incest and kidfic are not flavours that I like together.\n\nI’d love an AU version of the chess game in which Khaireddin’s death can be avoided somehow. Perhaps the child pawns do not get put in Gabriel’s side, but one on each and the game ends more favourably? Or else Khourrem allows the move to be made without the killing (you were petitioned multiple times, Khourrem!). I’d also enjoy a further scene in which Khaireddin does live to get to choose the next game to play with Lymond, and starts very slowly on the path to some emotional recovery. I’d also be interested in more about the little time he spent with Francis (which Jerott interrupted). \n\nI loved the scenes between Richard and Francis in canon, and their intense complicated relationship. I enjoyed the duel, I liked Richard's line about making Francis beg to be killed, and I loved Lymond's about how they can't be torn drop by drop away from each other - that was one of my favourite scenes in the books. I'd love to have a scene between them following the end of Disorderly Knights, with some angst and h/c following that showdown with Gabriel, as well as planning for the future. I would also enjoy something pre-canon about them, with their relationship en route to becoming what it is in GoK, but not quite there yet. I'd also love an AU where Richard turns up somewhere he didn't canonically, particularly in Russia or in the Ottoman Empire. \n\nIf you’re that way inclined, I’d also be up for some Richard/Francis, especially set before Richard decides to help Francis in the first book, with Richard still harbouring misapprehensions and resentment towards Francis. Something about Richard refamiliarising himself with his brother's body, since after all they have not been in close contact in the preceding years - he thinks about how Mariotta knows Francis' body better than he does, which we know isn't true, but something channelling that sense of resentment and betrayal would please me very much indeed. Alternatively, I'd also enjoy something set during Francis' mixed feelings in Ringed Castle/Checkmate in light of the complicated family history that's starting to unravel.\n\nLetter: http://deathsblood.dreamwidth.org/2098.html\n\n\n"

But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that that is not the case (we see snippets of his past, and what happened after Guts' departure from the Band of the Hawks). While he has no doubt done some shitty things, I can't help but feel a bit sympathetic (especially given that he pretty must lost everything he worked for overnight). Who is he underneath the veneer of a perfect and fierce leader? What are his fears? Why is he willing to go to such lengths to achieve his dreams? \n\nThis can be a story of when he was tortured/trapped in the dungeons, or him reminiscing his past, or what he was thinking in the moments leading up to becoming Femto, etc. The story can take place at any point in time in the story and it's up to the author to decide how to proceed.\n\nI do ship Griffith with Guts (let's be honest the homoerotic undertone is sometimes hard to ignore). If that's something you're comfortable with and would like to add it to the story, great. But honestly, I'm happy just having a story that explores things from Griffith's perspective.\n\n\n"

It was a unique series that offered a lot of interesting commentary about the relation between governing bodies and the people they try to govern/represent. But more so than Jean and his band, the character that intrigued me the most was Lilium. I honestly did not expect the extent of his involvement in the attempted coup d'etat! \n\nI would like to request a story that explores Lilium's character more, especially with regards to his involvement in the attempted coup d'etat. For one, a lot has been left out in terms of how Lilium convinced Grossular to get involved in the plans to the extent that he did. I mean, he pretty much had Grossular in the palm of his hands (quite literally), and it was very uncharacteristic of Grossular to be put in that situation (and honestly, if there's going to be a bit of smut between the two of them I really can't complain). Another thing that might be worth exploring is the motivation behind the attempted coup. It was mentioned that the Furawau District is being forced to provide natural resources to the rest of the Kingdom, and hints at the fact that this was the reason behind the coup. Yet, Furawau seemed to be prospering just fine when Jean went to visit. Does Furawau resent the fact that it has to provide for the rest of the Kingdom and wants to rule the kingdom because they feel is their right to do so, or is there something else?\n\n\n"

We know a bit about his and we only now hints of hers. She can't have had the easiest life. They never really TALK so if maybe somewhere down the line they'd start to reveal things about their pasts to each other that would lead to them connecting and working things out, I'd be delighted.\n\nSome ideas:\n● Future adventures where they go collecting artefacts together, like a 18th century Italian Indiana Jones couple\n● Settling down somewhere completely different away from it all and building a new life - or not\n● They end up as courtiers or spies for a powerful man or woman they can actually respect\n● meeting contemporaries\n● Méjaï's life before she ends up in Rome\n● Learning knew skills from each other (in or our of bed :P)\n● Working together to take down an enemy\n\nLetter: http://navaan.dreamwidth.org/588041.html\n\n\n"

Additionally, if you're in the mood to write some AUs, I'd like to read something where Gen is born a girl too, or they're in space, or maybe something where they're both married to other people initially but they eventually manage to wiggle out and get together.\n\nPlease do not write me fic with child and/or domestic abuse.\n\nLetter: http://neutrophilic.dreamwidth.org/1100.html\n\n\n"

I'm also very interested in Zarenyia/Miss Smith, Johannes and Miss Smith being necromancer bros, Horst having a meaningful relationship with a woman who isn't dead...\n\nA couple caveats: I really like the necromancy aspect, but I am unable to deal with cannibalistic zombies or serious body horror. More specifically, I was fine with the zombies in the first book, but I had to distract myself from some parts of the second book. Hopefully that gives you a good baseline?

I am a bit of a sucker for anything about Harriet falling in love with Peter against her \"better judgement\" and all outward indications - most outward indications, anyway (yes, Gaudy Night is my favourite book in the series). Also would enjoy seeing them sparring with each other before that point (UST FTW…) - we get woefully few descriptions of the many dates Peter takes Harriet on! Basically, if you can write Peter and Harriet being witty at each other, I’ll be thrilled. I’ve also always loved Harriet worrying about Peter - when she puts him in a cab home because he’s ill after a case, the whole scene in his club in Gaudy Night… (To everyone except Harriet, this is kind of a huge neon sign that she’s not completely indifferent.)\n\nIf that’s a tall order (no shame to you, I would flinch…), I’d love to see what the Peter/Harriet debacle looked like from the outside during those five years she made him wait. What did Harriet’s friends think? What did Peter’s friends think? (His real friends, not Helen!) We get a glimpse of Freddy Arbuthnot being chilly at Harriet in Gaudy Night (“I’m very fond of Peter...”) - were they all rooting for him, or did they think he was dotty? What about Mary and Charles? (How guilty was Charles feeling…?) Do Mary and Harriet come to be friends, after Peter and Harriet have sorted themselves out?\n\nIf writing any of the above is not going to work and you’d like some gen (and less Peter and Harriet), I always wanted to hear more about Miss Meteyard. Either her thoughts on Peter or the events of Murder Must Advertise, or her career thereafter. Does she stay at Pimms? Do she and Peter keep in touch at all? Also happy to read about that scamp St George - either his views on his uncle, or his possible future career. I’d like to think he grows up to be reasonable human being and not too awful! Does his view of his uncle’s marriage (and his new aunt) make him treat women any better? His description of women undergraduates as grubby always made me snarl - does he learn better? Or does he get his comeuppance from someone? (I do know St George dies, according to Sayers, but would rather not read tragic death fic.)\n\nHarriet and Peter and their further kids would also be fun to see. I loved the glimpse we get of the whole family in the short stories. Oh good grief, and what sort of grandma does the Dowager Duchess make?\n\nRelationships\nI think it should be clear I am all about the Harriet/Peter. :) I don’t mind mention of their canonical previous relationships (which for Peter, covers a fair bit of ground…), but would rather not read anything about them with people outside those. Make what you will of the other characters, because I don’t think Sayers commented.

I love all the characters (and mourn/am in denial about the dead) – though I picked these two because I love them most. \n\nI like how Alvis gets to be both the calm and collected religious leader, and a flustered (and sometimes dorky) guy who can be out of his depths from time to time - the scene where D'avin asked for emergency \"meditation help\" during combat and Alvis' reaction was to first go \"Now? Shitshitshit\" made my night, especially because he got to both panic _and_ solve the problem. \n\nFancy I like because he, in his own words, is the \"designated asshole\" aka Token Evil Team Mate, but he's not vilified for it. He's shown genuine care for other people, though maybe not in the traditional sense, which is interesting, especially as it's not really portrayed as a huge horrible thing. I wonder if being a Hullen was much of a change for him? It didn't look like he realized he'd changed back until he wasn't regenerating. Would love to see anything, throw-away line or longer scene, exploring that! Especially now that he's gone through all he has in season 3, with the changes that brings in his life.\n\nWith season 3 ending as it did, I'd love for fic that explores Fancy and Alvis' relationship, whatever it was up until the final episode, since Alvis saw fit to give his apology before the war to Fancy (or a fix-it fic re: Alvis; I'm always a sucker for fix-it fic). Or maybe the two ended up working together on something before seasons 3 for some reason? Involve as much or as little of the rest of the cast as you wish, I love them all!\n\nPS.

A 'case fic' would be great, but I'd also love to see what their life is like when they're not on Earth - is there life on other planets they also help? What is their own home like? Do they have a 'home'? Also, I love how Sapphire and Steel's interaction is affected by the presence of other elements, Lead most of all. I'd love for Steel's relationship with Lead to be explored more, since we only got to see them interact during one of the six original assignments. Lead seems to be the person Sapphire calls in when Steel is being unreasonable (at least when he's unreasonable about his own personal safety), but are there other moments Lead is helpful? And are there situations when Lead calls Sapphire and Steel for help? \n\nIf you like writing crossovers I think this is a series that lends itself well to that. If you ship Sapphire and Steel or other Elements, I'm down with that, but if so I'd love that to be combined with their \"not human\" qualities; i.e. I don't think Elements do romance exactly like we humans do it. With all of them being so not-human, does the elements' culture have such things as romance and friendship? Or something akin to it? And do they reproduce at all?\n\nI've seen the TV episodes, not listened to any of the audio stories, so feel free to go completely AU after that, but I don't mind spoilers (I might just not understand them). I'd prefer no main character death, if that's okay with you dear Yulegoat!

If you’d like to explore that, I would be Extremely Interested. If you’d like to take it to a more sexual place, honestly, in my opinion they’re both sapient and consenting and I think they would be able to work something out – Ebon thinks she’s beautiful, with her strong hands! She thinks he’s gorgeous and strong and ahhh I could 100% go for a fic of Ebon kinking on her hands on him, and her being all about his soft feathers on her. AHEM.

I love Mayu’s journey to finding herself and concentrating her passion from being someone who was originally only interested in new fabrics and creating new fabrics to someone who put that knowledge of fabrics and their best uses to expressing her own brand of comfort and beauty and personality. I love her friendship with Sarii and was screaming at my television in joy when she sent the coffee shop owner to forget the coffee beans and pick up her girlfriend from the airport instead so she could be in the big fashion show. Their friendship, while a side thread, was so charming every time it showed up, and I love that Sarii got to see all of Mayu’s frustrations and first ventures into sewing her own lingerie, which no one else ever did. Even after becoming an international supermodel, she does her best to come back and walk the finale of the show, joking that her price is merely a date with Mayu.\n\nAnd then there’s President Nanjo, who has an amazing depth. I love that at the start we’re prepared for her to be harsh and critiquing and stubborn and for her to be a sort of antagonist against Mayu’s journey to find her growth in this industry, but instead she’s harsh and critiquing, and stubborn, but also supportive, as she also finds ways to grow and learn new things from Mayu, with whom she seems to share more than just a similar name. \n\nDNW: character death/permanent injury, pregnancy/kidfic, and serious issues not already brought up in canon. also dubcon/noncon, watersports, scat.\n\nLetter: http://napkins.livejournal.com/255192.html\n\n\n"
