I’m really open to any kind of story for this fandom. Some examples of what I'd like to read are: a gen spy story, where something goes badly, maybe with Lee (and Amanda) and his (OC?) nemesis? Or a romance-focused story, maybe exploring Lee and Amanda’s relationship? Or else a slash story, for example Lee's former nameless male partner, that could happen to have been also his lover? I'd love a fix-it where he turns up to be alive, and Lee rescues him. Was he gotten captured and kept prisoner for some years? Was he brainwashed to have him betraying his country? Maybe the demise of his partner makes Lee aware of having been harbouring romantic feelings for him, and then the death man turns up alive and well and this forces Lee to deal with his feelings? I'd love an happy ending. Or a get-together, about Lee with a male spy, or counterspy. Or a dark fic where Lee gets kidnapped and tortured, maybe Lee’s old enemy is so obsessed with him that he kidnaps Lee to force him to ‘love’ him, with old-fashioned love potions, or having non-con sex with Lee while keeping him tied to the bed? \n\nAbout other dark routes, I’d love either Lee recovering after a (long?) kidnapping &amp; rape/torture/forced addition ordeal, or any other angsty situation. I love hurt/comfort with hurt Lee. I’d really like if there’s a sub plot with Lee getting together with a Russian agent or Amanda, but it is optional.\n\nIf my plot suggestions, or the prompt list here below, don’t work for you, I’d be thrilled also with a different story.\n\nScenarios that I like:\n• Unlikely alliances\n• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers\n• Survival story.

OC finds and rescues Lee who was left to die on the desert?\n• Lee &amp; his Russian nemesis team-up against their Governments to prevent WWIII?\n• Mission together: maybe they get paired together just for the mission at hand and end up to like each other?\n• Undercover as gay/couple, maybe it makes them realize/admit to like each other?\n• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers\n• Awkward situations\n• Competent characters with agency\n• Loyalty, Trust\n• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p\n• Lee gets kidnapped and brainwashed or tortured\n• OC, or Russian spy, or Amanda takes him to his home to rescue/hide him?\n• Any rating!

Please, let me read about why they’re having sex or how they get there, at the very least.\n\nI love this show so much! I really enjoyed the portrayal of the old US setting, it had to me a flavor of realism and honest research behind the scenes that I haven’t often found in other shows or movies with similar setting. I love how they also handled situations and characters, as a means to explore the cultures and culture clashes of the people native to the places and the ones recently settled there. \n\nI absolutely love some of both the main cast and recurring characters, though my favorites are the ones I’ve requested, their dynamic, both smart and world-wise guys at a young age, the bad patch the two of them started off with. I love that Luke had to brave through one rough situation after the other! I love that the initial circumstance – Curt’s death – that brought Frank and him to meet each other made them enemies, and yet they ended up to be on the same side and trust each other eventually. I’d be happy with either a fic going on from there, making them becoming tight friends, then if you write slash, I'd also love if you eventually become lovers (I love tropes like enemies to friends to lovers, and enemies to lovers). Or else I’d be happy with a divergent canon story, maybe one that explore a different first meeting and get together instead of Curt’s death, that maybe bring them on different life paths too? Like for example, Frank not becoming a gun for hire, or Luke a wanted criminal; or maybe they are both those things but together they turn to a different path?\n\nScenarios that I like:\n• Unlikely alliances, dysfunctional pairings\n• (Rivals or Enemies to) Friends to Lovers\n• Banter and bickering, antagonistic behavior, especially if it brings them to have (make up?) sex. :p\n• Mission together\n• (Slow build of?) trust and camaraderie; mutual loyalty\n• Spy story, case fic, with foreground or background relationship?\n• Undercover as partners in crime, maybe it makes them realize/admit a mutual attraction?\n• Partners on the run, or simply travelling together\n• Awkward or embarrassing situations, awkward or frenzied sex, semi-public sex, especially anal sex/intercourse\n•Yes to uncomfortable, embarrassing day after sex, whether it was consensual, dub- or non-con.

I'd enjoy many kind of stories, from ghost catching and then celebrating, to more serious stories like the guys having to resolve mundane problems, maybe they need a second job to cover all the expenses and Ray and Winston find a second job that gets them in trouble (take a stab at PI and that brings them to go undercover on a gay club -- and kiss each other to keep the cover?). Or Ray gets hurt in mission and maybe Winston has to patch him up on the spot because they are trapped there for the diration, and so on.

Now, with orders to Raid a Cimmerian Village for Star-Metal, an opportunity presents itself.  \n\n3 - \"And what use would there be to such a thing?  To trade Power, for Vanity?\"  \n\n4 - \"Barbarian Filth.  You're time has come.\"  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe why:  \n\nWrath-Amon, the one-time Gila Monster Sniffer, remade into a Humanoid Lizardman before becoming Chief Servant of Set when he overthrew his former Master, Ram-Amon.  Which in turn saw him gain a new more human form through the Black Ring's Power so long as he wore it and it remained charged.  \n\nThis is a character who is actually relatively deep and complex in a series that had a series-spanning arc, given the design of the series (Saturday Morning Cartoon), with even his own origin episode.  \n\nWielding immense power through said Ring, yet paranoid about any and all threats - real and imagined - that could cost him what he has.  Commands a vast army and followers, yet they listen to him only out of fear of his own Master, Set.  Takes great pleasure in bringing suffering to others (most notably with the draconic Windfang), while despising his own past, his own origin, what he really is.  In fact, the one time he allowed himself to revert to a lizardman (then lizard) was the one time that his own life was dependant on it.  \n\nAUs are a favoured theme of mine, taking what's in the series, picking out a POD and making a new world out of it.  From the small, to fate-twisting, to full-on mirrorversing (especially when the characters are still recognisably themselves).  \n\nAs for themes?

One who seems obsessed with collecting as much power to himself as he can.  Hence why (in my opinion) he put an end to his days as a marauding warlord and reinvented himself as a religious demigod, commanding thousands of followers who would leap to their own deaths at his quietest command.  \n\nThe links shown at the beginning show him in the form I like the most, snake-headed, serpent-man - which the novelisation of the movie stated clearly he was, the movie being far more ambiguous with regards to just what he was - and I would prefer that that be his primary form.  \n\nWhile there was a good deal of information given to the viewer, some of which was actually quite subtle and so miss-able on a first viewing, there's still plenty to speculate about.  After all, just how he established the Cult of Set isn't explained, nor how it spread so far, so fast.  \n\nBut it does tell me the sheer power and influence Thulsa Doom wields, having achieved so much in so little time, perhaps enough that he can safely show his snake head to at least his devout followers which I feel can be a good idea to explore.  \n\nIntellect is something I see in him too.  His idea to marry Princess Yasimina being to legally secure the Zamarian Throne of her Father, Osric: the Usurper, being an example of this.  \n\nOne other detail I picked up on was the sheer lack of value he placed on his followers:  The aforementioned compelling them to commit suicide just to prove his Power; Scaling Up thus abandoning Yasimina to save himself when Conan and Co. broke in; Trying to Kill Yasimina when she was lost to him; And clearly placing far more value on his pet snakes as he bluntly stated himself.  A real Villain through and through.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDark Romance, Fantasy.  These are the genres I believe would work here.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDNW:\n\nVore, both soft and hard - Doom's a much tidier eater than that I believe\n\n\n"},{"username": "Bahamut255","fandom": "Cinderella (2015) ","characters": "Lizard Footman 1 (Cinderella 2015), Major (Cinderella 2015)","prompt": "Preferred Prompts:  \n\n1 - Midnight had passed, the Witching Hour was here.

Hence my desire to see this done.  \n\nAnd given how little is given, I can see there being a lot of room available for expanding on this idea.  \n\nHow do they deal with being made Human, frequently without even being asked?  Knowing that it's only for a few brief hours before the Magic fades, and they're back to their original selves?  \n\nWhat would they be doing during the time alone?

The comics don't do a good job of giving him limitations (and the show is even worse tbh).\n\nI like Matt being a control freak but still not having control.\n\nI like Matt needing help, even if he’s shitty at asking for it. I like missing scenes. I like tough situations. I don’t have any really good prompts, I apologise.\n\nFor something from Elektra's focal point, I am interested in WHY Matt. Why are they drawn to him, why do they fight with/for him, why do they care about him. Elektra moves in and out of Matt's life. Why doesn't she just steer clear of him; it's not like she doesn't know he's a disaster? \n\nThere’s some nonsense about Matt in my letter post, feel free to hop over there. AS A NOTE, I really am not a huge fan of how Mark Waid writes Matt. I like angsty Daredevil way more than weird, shave-my-head-wear-a-terrible-suit and have a manic episode Daredevil. I'm not saying DON'T WRITE WAID-ERA so much as I'm saying, keep some of his darkness if you can! I like his darkness. I'm not up to date on the new run of DD so avoiding that is probably best just so I understand the context. My fave era of DD is around the time he ends up in Ryker's when he's being all I'M THE KINGPIN. Though honestly, putting a story in any vague era is totally fine, canon compliance is definitely not required.\n\nI would prefer not to have fic with Kirsten or Karen as a focal point. I also REALLY LOVE Matt's friendship with Foggy and if you want to talk about how much that matters to him, I am here for this! I think platonic relationships don't get anywhere near enough attention or importance in fandom. I don't ship Matt with Foggy at all but I love their friendship. Obviously I didn't pick Foggy here so if he's nowhere to be found that's totally fine as well - I just want you as an author to have more details rather than less? I don't know.&nbsp;\n\nFor these characters as a ship: I think this relationship is endlessly complicated because they have very very different moral compasses. Although I don’t think Matt’s is really perfect (especially if we actually count Shadowland as canon), it’s not anywhere near as off base as Elektra’s. And they’ve been enemies, but they’re not always. Elektra saved his life, after all! Like with Danny or Frank, I’d love to see WHY she’s so drawn to him, in spite of herself. What she thinks of the man that he grew up to be, and how they relate now.

I love how huge the world is; you could write a story about any background character and I would be fascinated by it. With Rose, I love her determination and stubbornness to have the life she wants, and how she's capable of being utterly ruthless when the situation calls for it. I also love her awkward, logical kindness. She tends to prefer books to people, and I am SO THERE with her. I love how cool and unemotional she is in a crisis, and her wry sense of humor at others' more dramatic emotions.\nWith Hannibal, I love that he is SUCH a fucking failbucket, and yet utterly aware of it, and how he's so grateful to those who are friends with him anyway. I really like the times when he manages to subtly undercut the privileges of his position compared to the others. I love how he makes friends with absolutely everyone he meets, and I love the slow growth over the series of his natural empathy, from a passive, fatalistic sympathy to actively going out of his way to do what he can for others. \nWith Ben, I love how he is justly angry about the world he lives in, and yet how he manages to take that anger and turn it into working to make change happen. He has intense abandonment issues, and I love how important friends and family are to him, and how he is constantly striving to build a community around himself. I love his sense of pride, the way his desire to be seen as proper and respectable conflicts with his frequent attraction to people who are outcasts in one way or another. I love how good he is at code-switching and making people see what they want to see; he is a good man, but godDAMN he is sneaky when he needs to be. \n\nOptional Prompts:\n– I would love a first-time, getting together fic for my OT3 set immediately after Crimson Angel. It’s such a dramatic book, with a ton of lovely tender moments between all three of them and so many fun tropes (Rose pretending to be Hannibal’s concubine! Ben thinking Hannibal was dead! Dramatic rescues! Bullet wounds!) and I really would love to indulge in even more of it. \n– I love canon-divergence AUs. One idea I was considering: what if Rose hadn’t been pregnant at the time of The Shirt on His Back? Would she have traveled with the others to Oregon? Or would Hannibal have stayed in New Orleans with her, leaving Ben and Shaw on their own? I would LOVE to see crossdressed Rose exploring the Wild West, but Rose and Hannibal forced to deal with his withdrawal on their own and despite societal disapproval would be excellent too. \n– EPISTOLARY FIC PLZ. I always love it when Hambly includes notes written by the characters in the books; I’m so fascinated even by little details like how they address one another (‘amicus meus’ is so cute it kills me) or how they manage to include secret messages that outside observers wouldn’t understand (whether that’s slipping into Latin or Greek, or codewords, or Shakespeare quotations). They do send a lot of letters and short notes in the books, and I’d love to see more of them: Hannibal’s letters from Mexico, Ben’s letters from Oregon or Washington DC, short notes during a normal day around the city, whatever.\n– Loyalty kink: there’s a lot of moments in the books where one character has to simply trust that another won’t betray them, because they’re unable to talk directly due to outsiders listening in or them being separated. There are so many societal factors holding these characters apart, and I love how they work around them (usually subtly and sneakily, but sometimes very blatantly!) to maintain their trust and friendship. This is my JAM. Especially if one character goes through a period of angst, believing they might have been betrayed or abandoned, before the other(s) proves their loyalty by coming through with a happy ending. Examples from canon: when Ben is afraid Hannibal has abandoned him in Sold Down the River, before finding out that Hannibal was really kidnapped; in Dead Water, when Ben and Hannibal are unable to speak directly to one another to maintain their cover story, and are confronted by Molloy and Davis unexpectedly. The way they manage to back up each other despite having no plan is delicious. I just want to wallow in a ton of angst and loyalty and trust.\n– I realize she’s not nominated, but I would also LOVE to get fic from Livia’s POV. Either backstory (a story about her as a child, as a young woman, from when her children were young, etc) or her view on a scene from canon. Or what does she think about Rose, about Hannibal, about the OT3? \n\nPS: I have already read 'Murder in July', so if you want to include details from that one, feel free!\n\nLetter: http://brigdh.dreamwidth.org/562830.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Brigdh","fandom": "Underground (TV) ","characters": "Cato (Underground), Georgia (Underground), Rosalee (Underground)","prompt": "I am so, so sad about this show getting canceled (though I am holding out hope some other channel picks it up!) and so I would love fanfic as a chance to spend a little more time with these characters. I love the heist take on the material, I love the big action sequences, the huge twists in practically every episode, the gray morality and that there are no clear lines between \"good\" characters and \"bad\" characters. I love the exploration of an underserved area of American history, but I also love that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is willing to have fun with these characters and their melodrama. \nCato is probably my favorite character (though I love the others as well!). He’s completely self-serving, ruthless, manipulative, cunning, and I love that about him. I love his dry sarcasm and the way he’s constantly pushing at others, testing them, testing himself. I love how he refuses to trust anyone else, and the way we learn he’s been hiding a deep loss all along. I want to know why he does what he does, what's driving him –&nbsp;though I suspect even he doesn't really know. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOptional Prompts:\n– Backstory about Cato, since we know so little of his past. What was his relationship like with Noah before Episode One? Had he ever interacted with Rosalee before (it seems likely, since they both have relatively elevated positions)? What about his family or childhood? \n– The episode in Season One where Cato and Rosalee dressed up and pretended to be rich was THE BEST THING EVER. I would love a missing scene set during that time, or an AU where they had to stretch the deception out longer. What if they’d had to spend the night together? Just tell me more about their awkward intimacy! :D\n– I'm pretty fascinated by Cato and Devi's relationship. I want to know all about it –&nbsp;what does she see in him? what does he see in her? Fic about their time together while Cato spends fortunes and self-destructs across Europe would be GREAT. I'd also be completely head-over-heels for any backstory about Devi: her childhood, her previous relationships, why she decides to follow Cato to America, any of that.\n– I totally ship Georgia/Elizabeth and fic about them would make my day. Fluffy, angsty, first-time, established relationship – any way you want to go with it would be awesome to me. Georgia backstory would also be great: how did she come to make the choice to pass for white? What was her husband like? What is her relationship with John Brown and family like? \n– On another note, I absolutely love Clara and would be so very very into fic focusing on her. She's another deliciously ruthless character, and I am really enjoying seeing her learn how to get power and use it.\n\nLetter: http://brigdh.dreamwidth.org/562830.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Brigdh","fandom": "Books of the Raksura - Martha Wells ","characters": "Chime (Books of the Raksura), Consolation (Books of the Raksura)","prompt": "This is very much an OR request (though if you can think of some reason to have them in the same room, I'm all for it!). In fact, I really love all of the characters in the tag set and would be happy with fic focusing on any of them; these two are just my favorites, which is why I chose them. \nI love this fandom for its incredible worldbuilding; every single one of the books has some setpiece that just fascinates me with its originality and weirdness, from a city inside a tree to underground pyramids to giant sea-turtles with cities on their backs to, of course, the Raksura gender/caste politics. I also love Moon and his struggle to understand Raksuran culture and the emotional difficulties of being part of a family and a colony; I love Chime's sweet awkwardness; I love Consolation's determination and misguided attempts to do good. \n\nOptional Prompts:\n– I'd love more about Chime's transition from Mentor to Warrior, and all the many ways he must have had to adjust: mentally, physically, socially, etc. It might be interesting to see someone else's POV on that change too, or more about other people who have made the same change throughout history.\n– Chime and Moon are obviously together, and Moon and Jade, but do Chime and Jade have any particular closeness? I'd love more on what they think of each other, or just see them spending time together, alone or with Moon as well. I could see this being either platonic or sexual, so feel free to go either way.\n–&nbsp;I know this is probably what everyone will be asking for this Yuletide, but I am SO FASCINATED by Consolation. How does her setting up in a tree in the Reaches actually work? What about trading missions with other Raksura courts? Does she convince a consort to join her, and if so how? Do any Abora volunteer to join them and help them learn how to function? What does the next generation look like?\n– I'd love a fic about Consolation as a young child. Maybe even from the POV of her father? What was that like, for him or for her, growing up in a place where they only had each other to understand them? A scene about her getting her name would <i>break my heart</i> in the best of ways. Or maybe a story about the father trying to teach her about the Raksura? Or one about Consolation making allies among the Kethel for the first time?\n– I also really love Delin, and anything about him interacting with the Raksura would be excellent. Him asking questions to write his book? Him explaining to them about the Golden Isles or some other culture? Him helping out when they get into a tangle with another Raksura court? Just give me this fearless old nerd man and his curious lizard-bee friends and I will be ecstatic! His exasperated family is also A++.\n\nPS: I have read all the short stories and also Martha Wells's Patreon, so feel free to include details from there as well!\n\nLetter: http://brigdh.dreamwidth.org/562830.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "brighty","fandom": "A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara ","characters": "Jean-Baptiste \"JB\" Marion (A Little Life), Jude St. Francis (A Little Life), Malcolm Irvine (A Little Life), Willem Ragnarsson (A Little Life)","prompt": "I would like a fix-it fic.

For any part or portion of any of this novel and of Jude St Francis' life: please feel free to pick the characters you most like, I listed the four friends to snag a match. I would be be happy with any way in which you chose to fix-it: are they women and therefore comprehensive psychological care is (almost) normalized? do they live in the future where induced amnesia is a palliative for trauma, yikes? maybe JB comes over one morning with pastries and talks about art with Jude? did Jude decide to stick around with Ana and go to UCSF and never meet Caleb, or anyone at all? (love the friendship vibes, but can you imagine Jude, trying out recovery, meeting Willem in their forties instead of their twenties? It'd be like a Slim Aarons photograph.) Did Malcolm say 'ah, let's build somewhere else' and thus the car accident never happened, and sometimes Willem awakens at night, cold, and wonders who he is? some of these are pretty horrifying as fix-its go, can you believe that Hanya Yanagihara edits the luxury supplement for the New York Times? all those years of writing about artful arrangements and elegant homes, and she just had to break characters who live so graciously.

They should've banged, it would be messy and ugly and hurt. Scorcher is my fave character in the books, and I think his choices are interesting.

I like the kind of drug and alcohol consumption in canon and don't think there's a problem with Theo making poor choices (two scotches and a pill before bedtime? sure.) I like au's and girl!characters:Theo's slump-hearted misery would be the same in any body. (Theo and Kitsey as women are basically a J.Crew ad for lesbianism.) I would love a story with references to art history and paintings other than the titular bird: surely Kitsey at least went to the Vermeer show at the Met? (I really like Kitsey! water-obsessed and pastelized as she is.) I would prefer a story that dealt with Kitsey and Theo within the canon timeline, when they are both making the best of what they're not quite enough happy with, although Theo doubts his ability to be happy with anything, and Kitsey's successes are hard glossy armor over an aggressive drive to never be caught out, it's not that she enjoys her affair, it's that she feels like running a four minute mile when Theo doesn't ask who's calling her. The inevitable ending doesn't have to be inevitable, either, if you like au's?

The only time she ever looked vulnerable was when Antony broke her heart. I'd love to read whether she actually did love her husband, did she really love him? Did she love him so deeply and then get betrayed? Was it so bad that she told herself that she'd never be weak and in love ever again, and then Antony happened and despite her best efforts she gave in and loved him.\n\n    I want to read about what makes her happy, truly happy. I want her not to worry about Atia the leader of a very influential household.

Wrenna's time imprisoned sounds like it was very traumatic.
