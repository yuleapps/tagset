One specific prompt I have is for an older Daniel, who’s escaped Brennenburg, to have met up with Justine in France, once he’s become a lead in his Archeology field. I’m very interested in seeing these two in a bad/wrong ship, with both of their grievous sins coming to a head. (Justine seems perfectly fine with what she’s done, while Daniel is wracked by guilt, enough for self-induced amnesia). I’d love to see them relate to one another, and see where their darkness goes. Considering the subject of this game, I am more open to concepts of torture or non-con, or just any general terribleness. You are also free to portray them as platonic just as well! Just for this request, I’d like fluff/happiness to be as minimal as possible – as this is a canon where I see very little of that.\n\nSuper optional request!:  I am also open to crossovers for other Frictional games.

It seems they grew up together, so how did that mesh with their different ways of life? Did Link live with the Zora? How did their relationship to each other change once he became Zelda’s knight? Can definitely be written as a ship, and am also intrigued with a smut-leaning if you want to go in that direction.\n\nI would also love to see more into earlier beginnings with Revali, and Daruk, and Urbosa. Including Mipha, I’d like to see how all these great heroes of their peoples worked together, and if there was any general misunderstandings or difficulties, and how they overcame them. An exploration into their deaths is also something intriguing. Of course, you can just mix and match which characters can interact as well! (I could not fit in Daruk as a requested character, so feel free to skip him if you'd like). I’d also be ecstatic to see a bit more worldbuilding explored for this canon – it was amazing to see that in the game, and having more details to just see the world and history that connects with previous LoZ canons would be great to read and learn about.\n\nLetter: http://darkhymns.livejournal.com/17924.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Darkhymns","fandom": "American Gods (TV) ","characters": "Mr. Wednesday (American Gods (TV)), Essie MacGowan (American Gods (TV)), Mad Sweeney (American Gods (TV))","prompt": "The show has done such a unique job of representing many of the god characters, both old and new, and some of their backstories as well.

Like, I love, love, love how Billingsley uses festivals, feast days, um British/Irish/Scottish folklore and superstitions, and folk customs that mark the passage of the year to frame Corinna’s story. (I’m such a dork for studying festivals and folk customs anyway, so Billingsley drawing on these traditions to make a kinda 17th or 18th century-esque fantasy world is like catnip for me. Like, oh my gosh, the Midsummer bonfire in this story and the throwing of the peats! Ah!!) I also love how much potential there is to explore gender identity and expression in writing fic about Corinna. Corinna as Corin can be so wonderfully snippy, vengeful, and wary - and then she has these moments of wonder and fondness as she discovers her love for the ocean, sailing, and Finian - or delights in her hard won knowledge and abilities. At the end of the book, the focus is so much on whether she’s going to go to sea as a seal maiden or stay with Finian and Lady Alicia, whether she’s going to give up words and language or keep them, that her transformation from Corin with his folk bag to Corinna in layers of petticoats is less explored. Toward the end, she says, “It never ends, this business of being a lady,” and I am so curious about how that plays out in her future. I would be  interested in any kind of story that examines how Corinna reconciles her Corin-self and possible Corinna-self after the ending of the novel. If the idea is of any interest to you, dear writer, I would be over the moon for a genderqueer Corin/na (I mean, genderqueer in our modern terms :)) dressed like a young lord or fisherman, working on boats with Finian - and a Finian who tries to figure out his attraction to the Corinna he knew as Corin and the person Corinna’s becoming now. If gender themes don’t interest you, dear writer, I know I would be pleased as anything to read more about Corinna and Finian’s romance or their life and adventures at Marblehaugh Park after the events of the novel. Or if you are drawn to write into some other part of the storyline, that’d be cool too.

The experience left me hungry to read more about them! I would love to see more fic for this ship, for this story; if you’ve matched me for this book, dear writer, I am just so excited to read your ideas, your characterizations, the themes you connect to in Everything I Never Told You. Here’s a bit about what draws me to the novel: the way the book deals with grief and how people move through it/around in it, the exploration of the racism Nath faces, the themes about alienation and the struggle for connection within families. I’m totally down to read about Jack and Nath getting together, making it work - how Nath realizes he has feelings for Jack - how Jack finally confesses his feelings for Nath, that sort of thing. It’d be rad to read a story set when they’re in college, where they visit each other in college and get together - or try to figure out how to keep a spark they discovered before they left home going in this new phase of their lives/amidst new geographies.

I will sincerely be happy with whatever your heart draws you to explore here, I am pretty certain. Um, I love Binh - how wry, self-deprecating, yearning, and funny he is. I read this book years ago and then reread it this past year, and oh, I had forgotten how charming Binh is, even when his humor and outlook on life are also heartbreaking. I’m moved by his drinking, his cutting, and his incredible observations about class and the nature of working for others, doing something so intimate as preparing their food. And you know, of course, the book is so lyrical and devastating, with all Binh’s thoughts about belonging, home, exile, and the warmth of fleeting embraces and encounters. Oh my goodness, okay, in terms of prompts, if I had to pick one dynamic to focus on...the wish of my heart is for a deeper exploration of Binh's relationship with Bao. Like, I love the setting of the ship, the tiny room with its bunks that they share, the fact that they’re at sea, which is a world in and of itself, a world apart from the world. I love their relationship, which Binh reveals to us bit by bit - Bao’s tall tales, his advice about hiding oneself, the way they both hide themselves and also give themselves to each other. (And don’t even get me started about the revelation about their names, ahhh!) Would I be oh so down for some hot feelingsy smut from their time at sea together? Oh yes, yes I would. If you are a looking-forward sort of person who wants to write a happier ending for Binh where he meets Bao again, would I be down for that? Yes, yes. Binh’s brief relationship and continued fascination with the man on the bridge is also really interesting, and I’d be down to read a further exploration of that. I didn’t request him or Lattimore but just as the novel weaves together Binh’s experiences with each of them, I’d be down to read a story where Binh still thinks about or encounters any of these lovers. I just…I don’t know, I love him with Bao the most, and I’m most curious about how he and Bao lived together, what they found in each other - even how they might find each other again. But seriously, if you’ve matched me for this book, I’m just super excited to see what makes you passionate about it and what elements of it you’re moved to write about. :)\n\nLetter: http://dasyatidae.livejournal.com/915.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "days4daisy","fandom": "Baby Driver (2017) ","characters": "Buddy | Jason van Horn, Darling | Monica, Baby | Miles","prompt": "This movie was such a treat!

Please write me anything you've got in you to write for him, I will love it. Anything about the autobiographical nature of a lot of his stories. Anything about his dirty diary full of black crosses and his difficult feelings regarding sex. Anything you want.\n\nODAO extra characters I wanted to nominate but couldn't figure out how to corral into a single sensible fandom name, if any of these relationships appeal:\n\nHarald Scharff: handsome principal ballet dancer with the Royal Danish Theatre. From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Scharff\">his Wikipedia page</a>:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  <i>In his diary entry for 2 January 1862, Andersen noted that Scharff \"bounded up to me; threw himself round my neck and kissed me!\" In other entries for January 1862, he described Scharff as \"deeply devoted… very intimate… ardent and loving\". In February, the poet observed that Scharff was \"intimate and communicative\" and in March he noted \"a visit from Scharff... exchanged with him all the little secrets of the heart; I long for him daily.\" Later in March he wrote, \"Scharff very loving... I gave him my picture.\" Scharff gave a silver toothbrush engraved with his name and the date to Andersen on his 57th birthday. In the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered a full-blown love affair that brought Andersen \"joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness.\" He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary for March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his \"erotic period\".</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBig age difference, affectionate lovers, and a handsome ballet dancer. It is everything I love. Andersen's story <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman_(fairy_tale)\">The Snowman</a> is supposedly about his pining for Scharff.\n\nJenny Lind: opera singer Andersen became infatuated with and proposed to. From Wikipedia:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  <i>One of his stories, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightingale_(fairy_tale)\">The Nightingale</a>\", was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\". Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: \"farewell ... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny\".</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCharles Dickens: Andersen was a big fan of Dickens (after their first meeting he wrote in his diary \"I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most\") and they became friends, but then OOPS disaster a decade later when Dickens invited Andersen to stay at his home for a short while and Andersen just kind of missed/ignored all the hints that he should leave for five endless weeks. When he finally went home, Dickens totally ghosted him and poor old Andersen couldn't understand why his letters weren't being answered any more. <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2014/10/01/dirtbag-hans-christian-andersen-2\">This is my favourite account of that outstayed welcome</a>, but it would be great to see something slightly less flippant. Bonus points for showing Dickens getting really aggravated by it all, because I don't like Dickens :P\n\nDNW: Andersen-bashing of any kind. I know he was often peculiar and annoying and didn't really have a brilliant understanding of when people were done with him getting in their way, but that's really not what I'd like to read about unless it's done with a bit of compassion.

Early photography and film is a HUGE passion of mine and I feel a bit silly and reverant about it all, I don't like the tendency to get a bit ha-ha about people being taken in by something that seems so sweetly ridiculous now (even though yes there's absolutely something glorious about a couple of little girls fooling some of the best minds of the era for so long).

Many men came forward to try, but none succeeded. Her parents became anxious for her to marry. According to Marco Polo, a particularly desirable bachelor prince presented himself around 1280. Most opponents wagered ten horses, or at the most a hundred, to compete against her. This unnamed bachelor wagered a thousand horses, and Khutulun's parents pleaded with her to take a fall and let him win.\n\nAn excited crowd gathered for the match. In the desire to please her parents Khutulun agreed to let the prince win. In the rush of competitive excitement as she stepped forward to face her rival, however, her filial resolve to please her parents melted. She grabbed her opponent by the arms, and found him to be more formidable than her usual challengers. He struggled against her, and they pushed this way and that, but she could not submit and allow herself to be thrown. The match continued for an agonizing long time with neither able to dominate. Finally, in a great surge of energy Khutlun threw him to the ground. She not only defeated but humiliated him, and he disappeared, leaving behind the additional thousand horses for her herd but having shattered her parents' hopes of marrying her to a worthy suitor.\"\n\nI just really really want to hear more about this strong brilliant defiant warrior princess and the billion horses she won from all the humiliated suitors she crushed in wrestling matches. This is the greatest thing.

How seeing that changes your perspective on everyday life, if it does at all.\n* Artist modelling being only half a step up from prostitution. Does that make anyone's decision to do it more difficult, or does it change anything for them outside of the studio?

Or maybe Navaan needs Greir's help to escape villagers who are angry about the results of her fake doctor business. Or maybe instead of the usual fuck-or-die trope, Greir finds herself stuck in a have-fun-or-die situation and only Navaan has a chance of getting her to crack a smile. Or just give me lots of chasing and fighting and sexual tension that gets resolved with acrobatic kissing and inappropriate use of fake death pellets. Or Greir could introduce Navaan to the Snow Queen for some reason that made sense at the time but now seems like it may have been a really bad idea because Navaan has broken out her fruit viking seduction costume and there are frozen bananas everywhere. Or whatever else you can think of.\n\nFeel free to include whatever other canon characters you want for supporting roles in the story or make up OCs. In terms of ships, I'd be equally happy with either gen or Greir/Navaan.

What we do know about him as a person is intriguing—he was a nerd who wrote books in Greek, spoke multiple languages, allegedly went around in multiple wigs/disguises among his own army, could be both ruthlessly pragmatic and yet deeply honourable and respectful to his enemies, and on top of everything was apparently the snarkiest person ever (from the few lines of reported dialogue in Livy).\n\nI would love a fic that explores these lesser-known aspects of Hannibal's character. Bonus points if you manage to make it light-hearted and humorous, since his life was, you know, already so depressing. (That being said, there is a truly frustrating dearth of Hannibal in fic or Internet fandom in general, so just know that anything you write will be water in the desert to me.)\n\nMy main ship for this fandom is Hannibal x Scipio Africanus, in both the romantic and brotp sense (my other main ship is Hannibal x Happiness and Peace and Not Being Hounded to Death By Romans). I just can't get enough of how they seemed to genuinely like and respect each other, and how Scipio tried so hard to prevent his fellow Romans from ruining Hannibal after the war. If you choose to explore this relationship, I'd love to see what they thought of each other when they first met, and the slow development of mutual respect and admiration (and attraction, if you go that way) between them. Epistolary! Having to keep in touch post-Zama for boring political reasons and then finding that they genuinely do enjoy their correspondence! AU where they're on the same side/have to work together for some reason! AU where they fake their deaths and live happily ever after!\n\nHannibal's family was obviously hugely important to him, and I'd equally love to read something that explores his relationships with his father and brothers (and mysterious unnamed sisters). Did he really swear his infamous childhood blood oath? There's a story that his father died sacrificing himself to save Hannibal's life--how did that go down, and how does Hannibal feel about that? Also, kidfic! Tiny Hannibal playing with his even tinier brothers, and/or teaching them how to Be Badass and Fight Rome!\n\nActually, I'd be really interested in anything set before or after the war; there's just so little out there about Hannibal's childhood in Carthage/Spain, or his postwar exile as a footsore Odysseus wandering the Mediterranean, dodging Romans and flirting with Scipio and throwing snakes at enemy ships.

That line in Aristophanes (\"They pine for him, they hate him, dismiss him, and want him back\") is the most delicious sort of Pain ever and I'd love a fic that brings this out somehow (maybe via Alexias' somewhat fanboyish eyes?).\n\nHis relationships with Sokrates and Myron are also incredibly fascinating to me, and if you want to include either or both of those characters, I would love anything exploring their dynamics in more detail. What did Sokrates think of his trashfire hellion pupil, really? What did Myron see in him? Did Alkibiades ever feel guilt about not quite living up to their ideals, and did this influence his actions at all?\n\nIf you feel up to writing Alkibiades' own POV, what about an introspective character study or monologue set near the end of his life where he reflects on all he's done? What does he make of the entire mess in Sicily? Did he or did he not vandalise the hermai? Does he pine for Athens as much as it pines for him?

Truly, a dangerous combination.\n\nAs you can probably guess, what I want most in this fandom is fic exploring the relationship between Blake and Avery even further.

I feel that there’s a hell of a lot of potential for a really interesting romantic relationship there, and I’d absolutely love to see somebody explore that!\n\nOne thing I will say, though, is that adultery is one of my major squicks and so I’d prefer it if you worked around Helen.

Is it difficult for Leonard to permit that last bit of vulnerability with someone who already knows him as well as Hap?

Especially as I nominated a strange handful of characters this year - Zazu, Tarta, and Caldina are characters I would love to have more fic about and Clef's my favourite so I'm always happy with anything with him, but I honestly just want MORE for this fandom. (It's the one I come back to again and again and again and I've had some lovely fic for it from Yuletide before and I would love a little more from the bottom of my heart.) \n\nI'm happy with whatever variation of canon you want to work with, including a mix, I'm familiar with and very fond of all of them.\n\nMy only specific caveat for Rayearth is that I'm not into shipping Presea/Clef or Ascot/Umi (though if you're willing to add Clef in and make it Ascot/Umi/Clef I am perfectly happy!)\n\nShips I do happily sail off with include - Umi/Clef, Zazu/Ascot, Caldina/LaFarga, Umi/Tarta, Caldina/Tatra, Presea/Hikaru, the knights together in any combination, and practically anything else. \n\nSome prompt-type things to be ignored at will: I love the tensions between the different characters with their various loyalties in canon - to each other, to their worlds, to what they think they should do. I love the world with its mix of fantasy and scifi tropes. Clef is my favourite character in anything, because of his loyalty, and the dilemma it puts him in and how he battles with the line between loyalty to the people he loves and the land. I'd like him to have a chance to be happy and also actually get some sleep after the events of canon! I'd also love anything about his backstory, how he came to be Guru, learning magic etc. \n\nI think Zazu is glorious in his enthusiasm for everything but especially giant robots - does he ever get to pilot one? What is it like being a ship's engineer so young - I'd love interactions between him and the rest of the ship's crew. I'd also love to see anything with him getting to know Cephiro and what he makes of the magic. \n\nCaldina's interesting morality and her honesty about her goals are wonderful. I'd love to know more about her life before Cephiro, or how she and LaFarga became a thing, or what she does once Cephiro is settled - does she get a job? Teach Cephirans to dance? Learn Cephiran magic? \n\nTarta's bluntness and her temper probably manage to get her into all kinds of awkward situations, with or without her sister there to pull her out again - I'd love to see something about her when she was younger, or something where she's trying to learn to deal with politics and finds her own way of negotiating them. (Or shippy fic with her and Umi!) \n\nGeneral likes: I happily read gen/het/slash/femmeslash/poly. Things I adore more than others include worldbuilding, partnerships - especially the development of them - fealty/loyalty, things which feel epic - not in length so much as the sense that there is a whole world about this story which you can glimpse in the offhand details, stories and mythologies within the world of the fiction, characters - especially women - getting to fight and to be awesome and strong in a variety of ways, swords, gender-confusion and gender-play, sensory depictions of the way magic feels, murder mysteries, AUs, and the kinds of crossovers and fusions which really shouldn't work and yet make far too much sense.
