Jacobi’s undying devotion to Maxwell delights me, and makes me wonder what bonded two otherwise fairly amoral, ruthless people together so strongly. Hera’s complicated relationship with Maxwell, her liberator and her captor all at once, fascinates me, as does the question of whether Maxwell left any ghosts in her machine, either metaphorical or literal. I love my pacifist addict bad-decision son Douglas Eiffel almost as much as I love seeing him suffer, and a story related to the Dear Listeners and him would not go amiss. Hera and Eiffel’s friendship and teamwork and hard-earned consideration for each other makes me happy, and I have been known to be trash for Hera/Eiffel. Or you could go for the curveball! Have Eiffel and Jacobi square off over a decision of moral relativism! Make Jacobi and Hera team up to take on command! I’m not kidding when I say I’m open to possibilities; go nuts.\n\n\n"

I think it's because I get such a strong sense of who Captain Alexander MacIntosh is from it, such a powerful personality comes across in his tone and voice as well as the words. I want a fic that shows me some more of his personality. He has a great deal to say about men in uniform, and if you want to play with that I would love to read it - anything from uniform kink with the elegant Captain Maxwell, to backstory about the handsome man with powdered hair and a red coat who cheated him in a game of cards. Or if you want to talk about his attitude to class, this proud nephew of the laird who so strongly identifies with poor ragged sailors. And for all he seems a bit of a pure aggressive military type, he's canny enough to stop and enquire before proceeding down the river, and has a light enough touch that he can find a friendly Wyandotte who will talk to him and give him the information he needs. \n\nI have to confess, I requested this partly because I misheard the lyrics the first time I listened to it. I thought that Captain Maxwell had begged to be put ashore, MacIntosh had ordered him below, and then fought to save them both. If you wanted to write this slightly AU version of the story for me, I would love that, whether you wanted to write the two captains afterwards (slash very welcome!), or describe the naval battle from Maxwell's point of view - Maxwell's point of view on the Nancy and her crew would be wonderful - or anything at all. Feel free to quietly ignore Captain Maxwell's wife and kids if that works better for you. \n\nI read up a little about what the Nancy was doing there and the historical setting, and if you want to use that, by all means do, I love historical stories and settings. But for this canon, if you want to transpose it to some other setting, go ahead.

So feel free to use that pairing.\n\nI also really enjoy the way Drizzt and Zaknafein interacted in the early books. I think it was a neat dynamic and would love to see a father and son interaction. Be it with a ghost of Zaknafein or be it while Drizzt was still in Menzoberranzan. \n\nDo you like to write AU’s? If so I would love a Modern Fantasy AU, where Drizzt is still a Drow, and the characters keep the race they were given in the story, but bring them to our world. What adventures and how would they interact in the world as it is now, with the high Fantasy of the books still a solid part of reality. \n\nDNW: Underage Sex, NO CLOWNS (I have a huge fear of clowns)\n\nLetter: http://ladybugnight.tumblr.com/post/166203528759/yule-tide-2017-letter-for-author\n\n\n"

I'd love to read about Kuroko trying to pry Reiko out of her shell, whether through awkward dates, vigorous sex, or both. (Also, uh, consider all the gunplay potential.

One thing that appeals to me in Oniisama E is the indomitability of the human spirit. Characters suffer, break, even lose hope, but they don't stay down. Orihara Kaoru is one of my favorite characters, a bastion of clear-headed priorities amid chaos, treachery, and bullying, but my favorite relationship is between Nanako and Saint-Just. I have a not-so-secret place in my heart where I am constantly yearning for *happy* Saint-Just/Nanako fic. I understand that their little love affair ends in tragedy, but it would make me so happy to see some moment when they had a nice day, and things weren't a complete trainwreck. Heck, reincarnation fic or some AU where they get to live happily ever after would suit me just fine, too. This also goes against my usual desire to see something less shippy for Yuletide. This pairing is the big weakness of my sappy, shippy heart.\n\nI love the tragedy of their story in canon. It's beautiful, it's poignant, it's so emotionally true to human experience while being so poetically dramatic; but if you can find a way to work in one happy day while keeping the series true to itself, I would be forever grateful (and there are, of course, many definitions of happiness depending on the people involved). And if you say... no, I'm sorry, it's impossible to put a happy day into this relationship given the established timeline, that's fine, too. I love Saint-Just and Nanako just the way they are.\n\nI love how dangerous Saint-Just is, to herself and to the world around her, and it crushes my heart (in that tragic, beautiful way) to see her cowed by Miya-sama and trying to remove herself from the world time and time again -- not just actively with suicide attempts and drug addiction, but in her behavior where she retreats to the bell tower, to her apartment, playing hooky from class and school, setting herself apart from any potential friends with bravado.\n\nI love that Nanako is unsure and blindsided by so many unthinkable things, but her attraction to Saint-Just is something simple that she never doubts or treats as wrong. I love that even when she's trying to save Saint-Just's life by giving her something half-way nutritious to eat or pulling her back from a ledge, she's not doing it to try and normalize her, or out of a fantasy that Saint-Just will ever be a sweet girlfriend, nor is she infantalizing Saint-Just to make herself a caretaker. She's in love with a dangerous trainwreck, and I think that may be one of the most comforting things in her life at that point based on the way she acts in those scenes versus the way she acts at school or with her family. It's an interesting frame of mind. I'd love to see more about it.\n\nFascination, which becomes devotion, then understanding, and could perhaps have become love. I wish I could read even one story where there's some sense that they could be good for each other, although Saint-Just can't be saved. And please don't feel compelled to make Nanako an eternal innocent little lamb. The fact that she grows into a sense of self, can consider what's before her and make strong choices (which may be the choice to be kind) is also an important part of the story. She doesn't want to be Saint-Just's sister the way she wanted her teacher half-brother to be her brother. This is a total contrast, someone she wants to be her lover. She's a girl having a coming of age, including her sexual awakening through her interest in Saint-Just (although I don't need them to have sex, clearly even a cigarette-butt indirect kiss is a huge deal for them).\n\nReally, all I want is to see them together, and hear what you feel about the way they affect each other. &lt;3 I also love all the other characters, so please feel free to include them if you see fit!\n\nLetter: http://psiten.dreamwidth.org/122797.html\n\n\n"

So I'd love something exploring their relationship. She did promise to keep him chained up in her dungeon a while, after all, and who's to say she might not change her mind about keeping him herself (and maybe preserving his strapping good looks along the way)?  Or what if she didn't die at the end - she is a powerful fairy after all? Would she get revenge and how would that play out?\n\nI'm also fond of thinking about pre-canon AUs. What if Aurora wasn't the only one cursed - or cursed at all? What if it was Phillip and he got to hang out with small woodland creatures while waiting for his true love? Does a strangely alluring woman show up and take him away before he can think too hard about someone hitting on you with the line \"once upon a dream?\"  Or what if it no one gets cursed at all - just a young prince whose kingdom is attacked by an evil fairy one day who only asks for one thing. \n\nFeel free to be as explicit as you want but please no PWP. Also, I'm still fond of Aurora, so if you do include references to her, no bashing. Lastly, please don't use characterization/plot from the live action Disney version.\n\nLetter: http://psychomachia.livejournal.com/141016.html\n\n\n"

You're not going to break us up! We're in looove!!!\"\n\nAnd my other most favorite thing is when Toreth does something he wouldn't normally do because he's doing it for Warrick.

How does Maria fit Debbie in around the tour?\n\nOr I'd be just as happy receiving something with only one of these characters. What was Maria's life like before we meet her? How much respect did she actually get for being a tennis player and how much for her looks? What happened to make her serve go so terrible? How did she feel being a gay sportsperson when there aren't many that come out before they retire?

But mostly for the friendship (with frequent teasing) between Adam, Josh and Alex. I love the times when they've done sports: whether it's racing each other, being terrible at disability sports or just scaling them down to fit in the studio. The Josh and Alex shipping (with Alex and Carrie Fisher shipping on the side). I like that Josh wrote Adam/Alex fan fiction when they had their handwriting analysed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CS-nuAAasg).\n\nI didn't request any characters for this because I'd be happy to see any of them in any combination. Maybe they compete at some more sports or write (more) fanfiction about each other. Maybe they invent a new sport that only they are good at and try it get it included in the Paralympics. We know Adam went to the Para-Athletics, but did Josh or Alex? Since Adam beat Jonnie over 1km at Superhero Tri, maybe they train for a 1km race and see who wins this time. Maybe Josh and Alex get involved in that, but in an inventive way that means they don't have to run 1km. How about if Adam was ill and couldn't do the show? Who would take his place? How much would Josh and Alex be sympathetic and how much would they tease him?\n\nI also ship Josh/Jonnie (and like them as friends too). I like Jonnie's hair and how he's the nicest man in the world, and funny too. And keeps touching Josh's arse. I love how much fun they had with Josh's crush over the Paralympics and in The Crystal Maze and the reminder of it on the second Para-athletics special. What really happened in Rio that stayed in Rio (beyond what we saw on the show)? Since Josh has got his hair done like Jonnie's twice now, maybe Jonnie gets his done like Josh. What about Josh's other bromances or Alex's revelation that it was just a Showmance, like on Celebrity Big Brother? You could include Jonnie's time on Strictly - and since Jonnie was upset he didn't get to dance with Josh on the show, how about him getting that dance?\n\nHe's not nominated, but I also loved Liam Malone on the show, if you wanted to include him. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the rivalry between him and Jonnie - maybe they're given more tasks to compete at. Or just Liam's humour or love of photos of himself - maybe he or Jonnie (or both!) do that billboard of them in their underwear. Maybe they rope Adam/Josh/Alex in to do a billboard too.\n\nLetter: http://www.paranoidangel.me.uk/blog/2017/10/02/dear-yuletide-writer-9/\n\n\n"

Or just Greg and/or Alex.\n\nI'd like to see something like the show, with tasks, banter, lateral thinking, reading between the lines of a task or just bringing in terrible items for the prize task. You could write one of the tasks we've already seen, but with different comedians. Or go with a new task. Or have any of them repeat a task, see if they've found a way to do it better this time. Have a later series do a task that was done in the previous series - see who's been paying attention to what came before them.\n\nOr change the teams - how would a team task go with different people in the team (who weren't necessarily in the same series)? Or cross it over with The Crystal Maze - how would some of them get on with those sorts of challenges? How would they do at helping each other? Or stick them all in an Escape Room and see if they manage to escape.
