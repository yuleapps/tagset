Also, you don't have to struggle to work all four characters here in; if only one or a couple feel right to you, do that. \n\nI adore the feeling you get in Stardew Valley that beneath every semi-stereotypical tiny sketch of a character there are actually deeply layered personalities and relationships, dealing with PTSD, depression, feeling like they don't have worthy skills, feeling unloved, feeling neglected, the desire to get out and make something of yourself but not the knowledge (or, perhaps, ability, financial or otherwise) to do so. I would love anything that explored some of these layers in the young people of Stardew Valley. \n\nI am especially fond of slash and femslash stories because it's just such a joy to play a game where I can romance everyone without worrying about gender but I'll like any story that takes these characters and their dilemmas seriously, like is there a solution for Penny's unhappiness with her living situation that doesn't involve her leaving town, or would that be what's best for her? Does Haley discover her secret depths without romance, is she already highly internally critical but stuck without a roadmap to change her habits? Can Elliott ever actually write anything? Does Sam need to leave Pelican Town to fulfill his dreams, or should his dreams stay dreams?\n\nContrariwise, I'm also super into the idea of putting any two Stardew Valley characters into any classic dilemma trope or pairing dynamic. Imagine Haley and Penny waking up married! (Did they drink a little too much at one of SDV's festivals?) They'd have a stunning odd couple dynamic but I think Penny could uncover Haley's secret tenderness and Haley could let Penny shine. Sam and Elliot find mysterious sex pollen in the woods. Or a baby washes ashore and Elliot has to figure out how to care for it. Or Or Or. The sky's the limit - and, again, I don't have strong ships in this fandom, so feel free to mix and match with different characters if you prefer.\n\nLetter: http://labellementeuse.livejournal.com/379916.html\n\n\n"

They could also be angels, demons, one of each, fates, muses, or witches. Are they partners and lovers, or bitter rivals locked in an eternal dance? It's okay if you only take one aspect of the video and expand on it, or if you try to pull all the disparate parts together into a single narrative.

I ship them dearly, and I ship them dearly with Alma when she’s alive, but I’m also always interested in gen about them as long as the bond between them is central in the fic. I didn’t request her because if you’re down for, say, case fic with or without Sissel’s help, I didn’t want to make any additional characters necessary. I just want the fic to star Jowd and Cabanela but also feel free to use the whole extended family aka her, Sissel, Pigeon Man, Kamila, Lynne and/or Missile at will! Or Emma or whatever.\n\nCabanela has Jowd as his whole motivation, and while Jowd’s family comes first for him, we know they were close and he cares for his BF(F) in his own way. I love Cabanela with his endless energy and confidence and Jowd’s fatalism, their occasional role reversals (who’d have pegged Cabanela for the hard-working guy and Jowd for the one who’d swoop in and get all the merit!), their banter and trust and tacit understanding, how after five years of not talking to each other and thinking Cabanela hated him, Jowd got that watch and understood what it meant and came through for his friend. I love their tragedy and the prospect of a happier life in the new timeline, with Sissel watching over them (and chasing Cabanela’s scarf which is clearly a fantastic cat toy). I love their design, their clothes and the shapes and details of their bodies, so if you ever want to indulge in physical details, not necessarily in a sexual context, stuff like a very soft hug with a majestic ticklish beard, either of their hair getting in their eyes when wet, or Jowd stepping on the damn scarf while Cabanela is hopping downstairs, please do indulge to your heart’s content.\n\nI think the game implies that Jowd, Sissel, Yomiel and Missile have their memories of the old timeline, while everyone else does not, so I’m always interested in stories set in the new present that use this imbalance – maybe Cabanela eventually gets briefed on what happened, but it’s still not the same as remembering.\n\nA story could be focused on those weird presents they reportedly gave each other – surprise me, or maybe in the new timeline Jowd gifts the framed gun to Cabanela, that missing piece of evidence that would’ve proven his innocence, now that Cabs doesn’t need it and doesn’t even know what it’s for?\n\nOr maybe it could explore a what-if scenario where Yomiel is stopped and redeemed on the Yonoa, but there is no timeline reset, and Jowd and Cabanela are left to mend what’s left of their lives.\n\nOr any slice of life plot in and around Jowd’s household is always welcome. Cabanela with his unwavering loyalty and enthusiasm, and that absolute confidence that can be charming or off-putting depending on the person and situation, and Jowd and Alma allowing themselves to be on the receiving end of that much affection, and giving him a place to rest. And at least Jowd has a personality that’s sturdy enough that Cabs can bounce off it, a charismatic presence of his own with his rough humor, physical prowess, brittle emotional sphere and occasional stonewalling.\n\nDNW: bleak endings, rape, PWP, non-canonical children, unrequested ships, canon retellings\n\nLetter: http://laughingpinecone.tumblr.com/post/166016025117/yuletide-letter\n\n\n"

The tree and all the questions and philosophical views that come with it, the seeds and that starry expanse at the heart of it all… and then Soria and then Maray and Kaptar, which we know so little about.\n\nI’d like to see it all filtered through Farley’s eyes because she’s my fave, and also because I think her background is pretty interesting in and by itself, having been pinecone’d away from Earth when she was three years old. It makes for an interesting counterpoint to the born-and-bred Earthlings like CW with his nostalgia (for the record, I’d read platonic banter between these two for days), but she’s no Hunrath native either. And the way her house got swapped into such a central position and became a hub for the community… cool stuff. And what about the mysterious deceased John Farley, who can’t be her blood brother because we’re told the only relative who came with her was her grandmother, who is highly unlikely to be her husband because of the way “Farley” seems to be used as her maiden name (the house she was swapped with is “Farley’s house”…) and who is buried next to a man? An adopted brother maybe? What made her end her stint as a mayor so suddenly? What’s a meditation with the Arai feel like, how does it change her outlook on her daily life? What weird thing happened on Hunrath one day? What’s daily routine over there? What required a team-up with dear Josef and did she think a little higher of him afterwards (I’ll love Josef if Cyan won’t, he wasn’t the right mayor during those trying times but the man has his merits damn it)?

Cheers to the FBI. Needless to say, I’d like to see my favorite character find himself again, on his own or with the aid of any combination of characters of your choosing. It’s never too late to shovel yourself out of the shit, Albert!\n\nI could see him resigning on the spot (especially if Gordon and Diane also disappeared?) and staying in town to heal.

Does Frank, in all earnest and from personal experience, recommend him a hat to cover the hair loss? Or does he end up bonding with Hawk, how would their snark and general judgeyness complement each other? Does he make it to Bookhouse Boy eventually, and what kind of adventures or simple late night chats at the Bookhouse could take place then?\n\nIn a year or two or five, does Hawk find Coop like Margaret predicted, under the moon on Blue Pine mountain? How do they reconnect after so long? Do they fall in love again, as changed, tired men? I find it an interesting Albert/Harry and eventually Albert/Harry/Dale scenario, filled with bittersweet possibilities. An Albert/Dale option could be that Albert does not stay in town and Coop goes to find him, and they start again wherever Albert lives now.\n\nWhether he resigns or not, does he keep in touch with Constance? Do they exchange punny second opinions and gallows humor in general over Skype?\n\nHe and Denise are on a first name basis, how did they bond, what’s their average night out like, or what happened in the Philly office back when Gordon was still their boss that Gordon could absolutely never find out about?\n\nSimilarly, with Diane, it’s so easy to picture them smoking together and presenting a united “fuck this and fuck you” front in the office, so what was their friendship like, how did it continue after Diane [got tulpa’d and] resigned? Onto even more painful territory, if Diane didn’t disappear in pt17 or if she eventually comes back on her own, how would they rebuild their friendship? Do they come to terms with that horrible day when he shot her? Does she remember those 20 years of their friendship and therefore also dying by his hand, or does she not remember, and so he did kill ‘a’ Diane along with all their time together, and found another one he didn’t even know he’d lost so long ago?\n\nTammy is pretty much his padawan, what’s her apprenticeship like? I love how she’s technically Gordon’s protege but he’s the one who takes time to talk to her and /know/ her (like the fact that she gets carsick).\n\nDid he… did he ever run into Wally by accident in any random corner of the country, and how’d that go down? Like, ignoring the Andy and Lucy connection (although I do adore Andy and Lucy), just Wally as his own very peculiar person, bumping into Albert or being involved in a case or whatever.\n\nDitto Jade – she’s got her brand of pragmatism and of managing to come out unscathed and unflapped by supernatural nonsense, it’d be fun to bounce her off another rare sensible soul like Albert who could easily turn up in Vegas working on a blue rose case.\n\nMuch to Albert’s chagrin, feel free to double down on the canon-appropriate weirdness!\n\nDNW: bleak endings, rape, PWP, non-canonical children, unrequested ships, canon retellings, Albert/Constance and hell God baby damn no we ain’t talkin about Judy (the last two mostly because it'd take a hideous amount of meta to agree on before getting anywhere and complicated fandom opinions aren't good for exchanges)\n\nLetter: http://laughingpinecone.tumblr.com/post/166016025117/yuletide-letter\n\n\n"

	"prompt": "You do not need to use all four characters for this request! \n\nWhat I'm looking for here is something about Oda Nobunaga and one of his lovers. He was just. Like. This goddamn <i>whirlwind</i> of drive and ambition and energy, and that would have been so overwhelming and compelling when it was turned on you, but so frustrating to try to hold his attention for long when there was always so much to do. I would (obviously) love to get sexual content for this one, but I would also love letters and poetry, or material culture nerding, and anything that fleshes out one of these people who stand, historically, in the shadow of their warlord. I'm ultimately a romantic at heart and I'd like to see one of these relationships portrayed in a basically positive light (e.g., I'm aware that it's likely his marriage to No was strained by her inability to have children, but I'd rather read about them getting along with and enjoying each other). The first things that come to mind:\n- with Kichou: So they were teenagers wed in an arranged marriage designed to broker peace between their fathers, who were minor warlords with neighboring territory. <i>This is some romance-novel bullshit in real life</i>. Neither of them had reason to trust each other, both of them probably expected the other to be more loyal to family than spouse, but they're young and fierce and hot (and he's still more impulsive and less ambitious than he will be as an adult) and sparks fly.\n- with Kitsuno: She was a widow when she met him, and he was still a minor warlord squabbling with relatives over control of Owari province. Frankly it was probably at least partly political for them to get together, too, despite tales of him being struck by her beauty; her father was probably glad to find a way to make an alliance out of an aggressive neighbor by using his widowed daughter as a bargaining chip. What was she expecting from Nobunaga? How did he compare to her husband? How much did they ever get to know each other? I'm in romance novel territory again.\n- with Ranmaru: Hello, completely normalized deep power imbalance, how are you? I'm great. By the time Ranmaru became Nobunaga's page, Nobunaga was one of the most powerful men in the nation. Between that and the fact that Ranmaru and his brothers had been taken in by the Oda household years before, after their father's death in combat, it seems really likely that Ranmaru would have looked at this attention as a great honor and a great opportunity. Was he still fighting a case of nerves the first time things got intimate between them, or was he totally on board? Nobunaga, we're told, admired Ranmaru's intelligence as well as his beauty, and I'd love to see some of that admiration.\n\nIn any case: if you love historical research, please go for it and I will eat it up. If you're daunted by the idea of trying to make sure your dates line up and your references to art and tea and textiles are correct, though, don't stress over it. I will enjoy the fic either way.\n\nGeneral DNWs: deathfic, kidfic (something set when Kitsuno is pregnant: ok, something about tiny Nobutada: not my thing), misunderstanding angst, oppression or bigotry as a major plot point, mundane AUs (high school, coffee shop, etc.), scat/vomit, infantilization, forced feminization, unrequested dub/noncon.\n\nLetter: http://cypher.dreamwidth.org/196712.html\n\n\n"

I would love to see basically any kind of exploration of what's going on behind that mask. Some options:\n- The planning stages of the move to hire the Black Company in the first place: are there allies involved, or is Soulcatcher claiming this pawn alone? Is this part of a long-term plan, or more a case of pulling a thread to see what unravels?\n- A battle Soulcatcher helped the Company win, or a trap they set together, or some other adventure that could slot into the book somewhere.\n- Soulcatcher breaking the will/soul of another mage to create a thrall.\n- A tale from the age of the Dominator, whether that's political infighting or magical warfare or I don't even know.\n- A folk tale told in the north that's based on something terrible Soulcatcher did in the distant past, distorted by time and distance into something people don't entirely believe could be true.\n- What <i>is</i> going on with the voices? Are they indeed captured souls? Manifestations of madness? Manifestations of the madness that comes of one body being full of a large number of souls who are furious at being imprisoned in the wrong flesh? there are sort of canonical answers to this but canon seems to change its mind about Catcher a lot.\n\nInteractions with any of the Company and/or any of the Taken would be great, with very few caveats: I'm not really interested in the sibling rivalry stuff that got played up in the later books (rivalry based solely on being powerful mages with competing aims: cooler), and I don't want stuff with Catcher trying to seduce Croaker at all. \n\nGeneral DNWs: deathfic, pregnancy/kidfic, misunderstanding angst, oppression or bigotry as a major plot point, mundane AUs (high school, coffee shop, etc.), scat/vomit, infantilization, forced feminization, unrequested dub/noncon.\n\nLetter: http://cypher.dreamwidth.org/196712.html\n\n\n"

I do ship it and if you do too, I'd love to see an exploration of how <i>that</i> changes, especially since on the surface it looks like they've swapped erastes/eromenos roles but personality-wise it's a lot muddier. If you don't want to go the shippy route though, I think you could probably still hit the key emotional notes—being reunited-except-not with someone immensely important—while assuming a platonic Master/Servant &amp; older-brother-type-mentor/student relationship. Ultimately I'd like to see a connection that is emotionally satisfying/comforting for Waver (he deserves a nice thing every now and then) but having it be awkward or complicated getting there would be great.\n\nIf you're not familiar with other Fate canons, how about something about what they were getting up to together during Septem before crossing paths with the player's party? They both appear to have gone rogue, acting without Masters, and Alexander just has this incredible force of personality compared to El-Melloi II being more self-effacing and hesitant about everything except his strategic abilities. What have they steamrolled together between Alexander's boldness and El-Melloi II's support? When and how did they bail on the Master/Servant contract, and did they do that together or separately? How did they get their bearings in this place and time that's foreign to both of them? Shipping is still great if you're on that train, especially with Alexander as the one to initiate things after noticing that his strategist appears to admire him a lot but somehow hasn't made a move.\n\nWith either prompt, Zhuge Liang's input on Waver Velvet's predicament would also be pretty great.\n\nGeneral DNWs: deathfic, pregnancy/kidfic, misunderstanding angst, oppression or bigotry as a major plot point, mundane AUs (high school, coffee shop, etc.), scat/vomit, infantilization, forced feminization, unrequested dub/noncon.\n\nLetter: http://cypher.dreamwidth.org/196712.html\n\n\n"

Is she traveling there in her dreams and is she fully aware of it? What roles do Kim Lip and Jinsoul play in the underworld?

Basically just... something where they both get to have something that they want, however briefly.\n\n- More quiet bonding time during the siege. I loved those moments in the book and how they were basically full of UST. Anything more along those lines would make me happy. \n\n- Cyprian's point-of-view on anything. Either during canon, or him coming to terms with what he learns towards the end. \n\n- An AU where Radu or Lada somehow end up living in Constantinople? How does that effect the relationship between Radu and Cyprian?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote: I really love Nazira and Lada, so I welcome them in any capacity if you want to include them.\n\nLetter: http://atreidai.dreamwidth.org/1988.html\n\n\n"

	"prompt": "This is my nostalgia fandom request this year, I guess!\n\nLearning about Greek mythology in middle school, I remember really enjoying the labyrinth stories. I enjoyed the coda where Ariadne goes from being abandoned by Theseus to being the wife of Dionysus. As a kid it just seemed like an appropriate happy ending for a character who really deserved it. \n\nNowadays, though, I tend to wonder what Ariadne thought about the whole thing. So I'd be content with any story about Ariadne/Dionysus that centers her point-of-view in the goings-on. I'm open to all variations, happy or sad, brutal or light-hearted. This is one of those ones where I'd welcome a \"five times\" style fic that explores different scenarios. \n\nSome prompts:\n- Ariadne doesn't want to be with Dionysus at all. Maybe she's still in love with Theseus. Maybe she doesn't love him anymore but also doesn't want to be with a god she doesn't know. But the power differentials are such that she's stuck being Dionysus's wife anyway. How does she cope with all this? What's it like to be made immortal when you weren't even seeking that in the first place? What's it like, in those circumstances, to find yourself the wife of a god things like wine and ritual madness (thanks, Wikipedia) in particular? You can go as dark as you want with this if you go this route. \n\n- Ariadne does want to be with Dionysus. Either she's been dreaming of him for years (I've seen some stories take this route), or he comes to her on her island and tries to win her over. I do enjoy stories of second loves. There's something poignant about falling in love again after your heart has been broken (and Ariadne really did give up everything for Theseus, so that abandonment had to hurt.) Maybe the aforementioned god of wine and ritual madness is very, very careful with this mortal woman and she falls in love again. \n\n- It would also be fun to skip over the 'how they get together' and instead just explore the particulars of what it's like to go from being human to being immortal. I imagine it's really intense. And she also picks up a bunch of bizarre in-laws. Hell, one of those said in-laws- Poseidon or Athena I'm not picky- is responsible for the minotaur in the first place. Probably leads to some awkward dinner conversations. Maybe she ends up hanging out with Psyche a lot and they make a support network of mortal women who became immortal.\n\nLetter: http://atreidai.dreamwidth.org/1988.html\n\n\n"

I especially like the idea of Mark having a crush on both of them, matchmaking while under the assumption that he was going to die, and then pining due to the fact that he ended up not dying.\n\nLetter: http://lily-c.dreamwidth.org/1217.html\n\n\n"

It's so interesting that she wanted to escape her life so badly, wanting to follow Morgaine and Vanye, only to witness the chaos in their wake and be too afraid to take the final leap. Watching people she despised escape while she could not. How would she feel about staying behind in a drowning, dying world? What does she think about herself? What difference does it make that at least some of the people she'd wanted to escape were gone, and that she now has a position of power where she feels needed? What about an AU where she did go? Would that have given her something she could live with? What would her dynamics with Morgaine and Vanye look like, and how would they affect the Morgaine and Vanye dynamic, if at all?\n\nLetter: http://tigerlily.dreamwidth.org/35247.html\n\n\n"

I've always loved that premise! \n\nAlso, while I love Laura and don't mind if she's included, please nothing too overly romantic/sexual between her and Shadow, alive/dead romance is a bit of a squick.\n\n\n"

	"prompt": "Copying this almost wholesale from last year's request. Every time I watch Ferris Bueller, I find myself more and more curious and interested in Jeanie.  We see her being bitter and angry and kind of awful through most of the movie … but it’s also only one day, and a day when she dealing with an immense amount of Ferris-induced bullshit. We also see her scared, and giddy, and willing to save Ferris’s ass with Rooney at the end. So… what’s she really like?\n\nPossible roads to explore: \n\nJeanie and Cameron?? Ok, go with me here. Talk about two people who know Ferris, who have seen every scheme he’s ever pulled and have been pulled into them whether they wanted to or not. What if they decided to scam him… through fake dating? And maybe it’s subtle fake dating, because the what they want is Ferris knowing something is going on between them but not what… are they secretly dating? Are the plotting something? Are they just fucking with him? And maybe the line starts to blur for them? (Or maybe it’s not fake at all, it’s just a bonus that they get to mess with Ferris)\n\nAs frustrated as Jeanie clearly is that Ferris gets away with everything, there’s obviously love there too. What were they like growing up together (I headcanon them as twins, but whatever your stance is for their relative ages is cool with me). How does their relationship change when they leave for college and aren’t in constant close quarters/conflict? Do they have a careful truce in the aftermath of the day off, and how does that play out?  (PLS no incest)\n\nJeanie and Sloane:  don’t have as much here, to be honest. Do they really know each other at all? If you have some kind of idea of a relationship between them that doesn’t revolve around Ferris, I’d love to see what that looks like since they seem very different. If you ship it and want to sell me on why Jeanie is a better Beuller for Sloane than Cameron, I'd be interested to see how that plays out. Whether you want to do an \"after Sloane and ferris break up\" or some other way (please no infidelity/cheating).  \n\nJeanie’s future in general! I don’t really have a picture of what her long-term future looks like in part because so much of what we know about her is the contrast between her and Ferris, so go wild! Tell me who Jeanie is on days when the entire universe isn’t focused on Ferris. What is school like for her? Who are her friends? Where does she go to college? Does she ever see the guy from the police station ever again (ugh, Charlie Sheen, but whatever)? Where is she now?\n\nLetter: http://lovelypoet.dreamwidth.org\n\n\n"

Koshiyama learning more about Gakuto or Seiji's pasts, and how that might connect or not connect with his rivalry with Mikuriya would be fascinating too.

Having them both really get into it and into each other and/or having the fight end in somebody getting railed against a wall: also good.\n- Astolfo and Siegfried both drew short straws on the \"who's getting a shitty master?\" lottery and I'd love to see them recognizing that in each other and forming some kind of tentative alliance around it; their personalities are so diametrically opposed, it'd be an interesting struggle for either of them to connect with the other.\n- Astolfo and Sieg have such a sweet thing going on, with their mutual desire to protect each other from terrible shit, and I'd love to see that turn more explicitly romantic.\n- Really seriously tho the \"likes\" section of Astolfo's profile reads \"all this world,\" and I just want to see some of that passion for and joy in life shared with people who need help seeing it, gosh.\n- Siegfried/Sieg dreamspace sex would be interesting and sweet and sad, with lots of layers of both of them trying to figure out how to articulate and act on their own needs instead of other people's plans for them.\n- If you want to go dark, consider an Alter for one of the Servants here. Maybe Yggmillennia isn't satisfied with losing their Saber and try to re-summon him and he doesn't show up the way they expect? What would Siegfried Alter even be <i>like</i>?\n\nGeneral DNWs: deathfic, pregnancy/kidfic, misunderstanding angst, oppression or bigotry as a major plot point, mundane AUs (high school, coffee shop, etc.), scat/vomit, infantilization, forced feminization, unrequested dub/noncon.\n\nLetter: http://cypher.dreamwidth.org/196712.html\n\n\n"

Does James travel with her? Do they spend a lot of time apart but know that each other is home? Do they maintain a friendship with Lara? Do they get remarried? What does a wedding of their own planning look like? \n\nIf you want to reach backward instead and tell me about how Iseabail felt about Katie leaving the island for the first time, or how she felt as a single mother realizing she herself wasn't going to be able to have her adventures... Or the island's reaction to her relationship with Katie's father, or her own feelings about him after time passes...\n\nLetter: http://lovelypoet.dreamwidth.org\n\n\n"

How does this influence the terraforming debate?\n- Arkady on Antarctica, pretending to be boring and hiding his revolutionary anarchist plans. His inner monologue is probably hilarious...\n- Marina/Ursula/Vlad - what does that relationship look like? We don't get any of their POV:s, but it's made pretty clear that theirs is a poly relationship. Also it would be fun to hear them working on their ecological economics. \n- Frank/John/Maya. They are not actually my favorite characters, but Frank/John is a slash pairing that cries out for someone to write it. \n- Nadia is one of my favorite characters, so maybe just tell me a story about her solving an engineering problem? \nOr tell me whatever story interests you most! : ) I really like all the landscape description and technical detail in the books, so feel free to pastische that if you want, but you don't have to (I get that it could be daunting!). I also like all the people and communities and political debate in the Martian underground. I think character and setting is what I'm most interested in here. \n\nDo-not-wants: I would prefer a story that isn't centered around someone's death. Sex is fine, but I would prefer not to get a PWP fic. Also, maybe relevant is that my political opinions are to the left, so if you tell me a story dismissing everything about the Martian revolutions as wrong, I am probably not going to appreciate that. Although of course politics doesn't have to come into the story at all, if you're not interested in that!\n\nLetter: http://luzula.dreamwidth.org/275644.html\n\n\n"
