Princess Bride (1987) 
Inigo Montoya, Fezzik (Princess Bride)

While I'm not the biggest fluff lover, I am totally fine if this one leans a little fluffy. Sometimes the amount Inigo and Fezzik care about one another makes me want to cry. It is to the movie's credit that it gave us what I feel are two beautiful romances. I would love to see this one become explicitly a romance. A post-canon thing would be great, since the ending mostly focuses on Westley and Buttercup and I want to know what Inigo and Fezzik's story holds. Pre-canon, their stories before Buttercup encounters them in the woods, could also be fun. We get a bit of their backstories, but there is probably room to play. The two of them having any sort of adventure together in the spirit of the story would also be a delight I have read the book, so if you have, feel free to incorporate aspects or details from that. If you haven't or do not feel like it, also totally fine. Smut is welcome if that is a direction you'd like to go!

Rocky Horror Picture Show 
Columbia (RHPS), Magenta (RHPS)

I think the moment that most captures my interest in Columbia and Magenta is during "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" when they are lounging in Columbia's room and Columbia is painting Magenta's toenails for her and they are watching Janet with Rocky and egging Janet on. I want to know more about their relationship! I know Columbia had Eddie and Magenta had Riff-Raff, but with how debauched their lives seem to be, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little more to their relationship. I would be happy to see any backstory or exploration of their relationship, including conflict between them (Magenta wants to return to Transylvania, Columbia seems dissatisfied after Eddie is gone; they seem to have very different desires and I can see them clashing). If you want to go a smutty direction, I can imagine the two of them getting worked up over seeing Janet and Rocky together and going at it together. First times are always fun to, either the first time they met when Columbia joined Frank, or their first time hooking up.

We Know the Devil (Visual Novel) 
Jupiter (We Know the Devil), Neptune (We Know the Devil), Venus (We Know the Devil)

I would love to see a post-canon for these three. The ending (all of them, but especially the True Ending) is so beautiful and open that I would be into seeing what comes next: what is this new world like and what do these girls, in their new angelic/monstrous bodies, do in it? A scene taking place in the course of the game that you wished had happened, or a pre-canon story of the week at camp leading up to their night in the woods would also be rad. Feel free to get weird, if you want to do something in the grand and poetic and emotional style of the game, or do something with a bunch monstrous girls in a world ruled by the Devil or what it means to all be in love in that situation.

Black Widow (Comics) 
Natasha Romanov (Black Widow Comics)

In Nathan Edmondson's recent run on Black Widow, Natasha grudgingly adopted a black cat named Liho (an old-fashioned Russian word for "evil" or "bad luck" or "the devil"). I'd like to see a story exploring that side of her character--the reluctantly vulnerable side of her that takes care of small vulnerable creatures while still being tough as nails in her own way. If you're not familiar with that particular run, it doesn't have to be about Liho in particular, of course! But I do love cats.

I'm a Bucky/Natasha fan, but I have no problems with the story just being about Natasha, or about her relationships with other characters.

Final Fantasy IV 
Rydia (Final Fantasy IV), Edward "Edge" Geraldine

Final Fantasy IV is a pretty bare-bones game as plot and characterization goes, considering its era--but I've always been curious how the relationship between spoiled prince Edge and mysterious troubled summoner Rydia would have developed if it had been expanded beyond jokes and hints.

I don't necessarily want to see them hook up and have babies ever after, but I'd like to see some exploration of the brief dynamic between them in canon where he flirts and she brushes him off awkwardly but shows some kind of interest at the end.

I still haven't played the After Years, so I'd prefer not to get too deep into that.

I would be happy to read just about anything in this fandom, honestly--I like the worldbuilding, I love the main characters, and I love the decent heart of the story. But I especially thought it would be fun to learn more about Gairad since she's from a different part of the universe, with a different perspective from any of the main characters. Backstory, or her perspective on canon events, or post-canon stories, would all be fun; I'm interested in her relationship with Jainan but would also be happy to read about her with other people or alone.

Dykes to Watch Out For 
Giant Lesbian Potato Genetically Engineered By Monsanto

For additional likes please see my letter. 

I do not want stories containing: dub-con, non-con, mpreg, A/B/O, incest, underage, homophobia, transphobia, self-harm or suicide.

I don't want fic based on specific past or current real-world environmental disasters, nor their impacts on living people. AUs, Green Aesops and analogies, cosmic or otherwise, are fine, as are more general themes about anthropogenic environmental degradation.

I’d rather not receive PWP, RPF, or holiday-themed stories.

I'd prefer Monsanto were not portrayed in a positive light. 

***

Ah, Dykes to Watch Out For, the slice-of-life-always-politically-relevant-lesbian-soap-opera of our hearts. I'll be honest with you, barring one day getting the television adaptation we deserve, I'm pretty happy with how canon (semi-)ended. I think we left most of the characters in pretty good places. No, I'm here for something over-the-top, cracky, and absurd, based on a one-page (p. 225 of 'The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For', in fact) dig at Monsanto. What I would love, truly, is for you to run completely wild with this, take the fact that this is Mo's dream out of the equation, join hands and imagine with me that publicly traded American multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation (thanks Wikpedia for that sentence), Monsanto, did, in fact, genetically engineer a giant lesbian potato. And, Yulegoat, I have but one question for you:

Who is she?

The potato in question can be the one in Mo's dream or, really, any generic Giant Lesbian Potato Genetically Engineered by Monsanto. 

Dystopias, utopias, neither-better-nor-worse-alternate-universe-opias, it's all good here. If you work a joke about 'eating your vegetables' in there I can guarantee at least one person (me) will laugh.

If you're going to include other DTWOF characters, my favorites are Lois, Clarice, Ginger, Sparrow, Sydney, Thea and Janis.

***

This whole film is basically a big love letter to A) math (!) and science (!), and B) humans helping other humans out, which I love. I also loved Rich Purnell. He's kind of a mess! He's a steely-eyed missile man! This is the kind of film where most of the cast gets to be a hero, but I was especially pleased when Rich played his part in saving the day. His scenes were funny without feeling like you're laughing at him; his initial mishaps are relatable, and you really want to know if he solves that problem! If you're going to include other characters, I'd be most interested in seeing Bruce Ng, Mark Watney, Vincent Kapoor, or Mindy Park. If you're writing shipfic I'd prefer Rich/Bruce or Rich/Mark. I'm pretty much down for whatever wacky science fiction premise you want to toss in the ring here, so long as there's a healthy dose of saving the day with mathematics. 

Prompts:

When we meet Rich, he's behind on his work, trips, then spits coffee through a bin. His supervisor, presumably, seems used to this. Prior to the Ares III mission, what's Rich's life like? How did he come to work at NASA? 

The scene at the end, where he and Bruce exchange a look across the room, watching the next mission launch, seems unusual, like Rich doesn't often participate in things like that. Does he now? Are he and Bruce friends? 

Does he get a lot of attention now? How does he deal with it? Does he meet Mark Watney? 

If it were Rich, not Mark, stuck on Mars, how would he react? How would he get back to Earth? What would he say, upon being told the whole world was reading his written responses?

I've requested any and I mean it: go wild, whoever you want to write about is fine by me. Unless it’s Saul/Charlie you’re writing, I’d prefer f/f if it’s shipfic and I'm pretty much down for whoever you want to include there. I'd really enjoy Ghost Bird/The Biologist, Grace/The Psychologist, Grace/her wife, and Anyone/Area X itself, but don't feel limited by that.

Prompts: 

Ghost Bird and Grace, post-canon, back on the other side. What if everything is different? Has it changed for the better, or worse?

More of the Biologist's field work before her recruitment. Perhaps the Psychologist tags along as part of the screening process. If it's a coastal place, how does the Psychologist feel about it? 

What happened to Whitby? I'd love something that tracked his progress from a fresh-faced recruit to the science division pre-canon to his eventual fate in Area X.

What was Saul's life like before moving to the lighthouse? Did he have other brushes with the strange and unexplained? Is there any possibility of freedom?

I’d love more interaction between the Psychologist and Whitby, or the Psychologist and Grace, pre-canon.

The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society - Mary Ann Shaffer & Annie Barrows 
Sidney Stark, Juliet Ashton (Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society)

I would love to read just about anything chronicling the lifelong friendship of these two, be it pre-novel, post-novel, or heck, both! How did Juliet's girlhood friendship with Sophie evolve to include Sophie's much older brother? Around when and how did Juliet and Sidney properly become friends in their own right? What did Sidney think of his little sister's friend Juliet initially, and how did his feelings about her change? What about that incident when she apparently broke his leg, and he was "a vile patient"? Did they ever, a bit wine-buzzed perhaps, debate the pros and cons of her becoming his beard? How did he encourage her as a writer? How has their relationship changed now that he's her long-suffering (but happily so) friend/editor?

If you want to include other characters, how have Sidney and Juliet interacted over the years with each other's other friends, acquaintances, and romantic partners? Juliet's letter concerning Sidney's disappearance to tend to Piers could be read as implying a past relationship between the two. If so, what was that like? Did Juliet tease Sidney incessantly over his having found a man? Was she secretly rooting for them, and sad when it ended? (How did it end...or did it even really end?) Did Juliet ever have her own bond with Piers as a fellow writer, independent of his relationship with Sidney? As for Sidney's feelings about Juliet's boyfriends...we know he (rightly) disliked Mark, and seems (again, rightly) approving of Dawsey. Does he cultivate his own friendship with Dawsey (or vice versa) now that the latter is engaged to Juliet? Does he give a speech for Juliet at her wedding? Does he spend her reception trying to duck Isola's hare-brained but well-intentioned attempts to hook him up with Booker, because they are both homosexual? Is Juliet, now happily settled with Dawsey and Kit, not-so-subtly trying to convince Sidney to move to Guernsey one day as well? Has she enlisted Isola to help her out with this? Tell me anything and everything!

The Avengers (TV) 
John Steed (The Avengers (TV)), Emma Peel (The Avengers (TV))

First off...I ship it. I will always ship it. I'm not much of an OTP kind of person, but Steed and Emma are about as close as I get. They are the pairing of my heart and soul. However, that being said...I do not, and will never, ship it in a "conventional romance" kind of way. No wedding bells and baby carriages for these two; they're going to be having unbelievable adventures defending Britain from its campiest foes until they're old and grey. (In my headcanon, they don't even move in together until they *are* old and grey.) For this reason, I would far rather read gen with maybe a few canon-like innuendos thrown in than anything super-sappy, so if you don't ship it, no worries. You are 100% safe, and I will love anything you write.

As far as prompts are concerned: outlandish casefic is always great! Intimate private moments between cases are always great! Fix-it fic for "The Forget-Me-Knot" is always great! (It's just a blip on the radar, an unfortunate misunderstanding, a ship that's sailed, etc. The Tara series in general is but a footnote... though Tara herself is awesome and deserves to go on as the hero of her own story, so please don't take that as character-bashing!) Fic where Cathy turns up again and immediately bonds with Emma, and Steed has to contend with the two of them united, would be great! (Bonus points for exploring Steed's transformation from the much harder-edged character Cathy knew into the true gentleman who falls for Emma.) Fic about their still-action-packed twilight years would be great! (And if you like crossovers at all, maybe around 2008-ish said action-packed twilight years could cause them to cross paths with Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman.) Fic about their earlier lives, leading up to the moment they finally meet, would be great! Anything involving Emma kicking arse, and Steed truly finding this a joy to behold when he isn't busy also kicking arse, would be great!

I also to some degree ship both/either of them with Chidi and to some degree none of them with anybody...but this year, I really want either Eleanor/Tahani or gen focused on Eleanor and Tahani (with pretty much anyone else welcome to appear as a supporting character, as I do love everyone). Show me the two of them getting their friendship back on track now that Michael's given up the constant rebooting, and maybe Eleanor rediscovering that she might legit be into Tahani! I'd really love anything from pure comedy to smut to something much deeper and more thoughtful (not that these are mutually exclusive). In every iteration, Eleanor knows right away she was meant for the Bad Place, while Tahani easily believes she belongs in the Good Place and takes it much harder when she finds out she doesn't...maybe explore Tahani dealing with that revelation, and Eleanor helping her through it? Or hey, what about that one iteration where they were soulmates? Was that the one time Tahani made it to Mindy's house in the Medium Place? Does Jason have any totally accidental wisdom to help push them together? Really, please go wild...heaven knows canon has!

Arrested Development 
George Oscar "Gob" Bluth, Tony Wonder

So, we are definitely (FINALLY) getting new AD again in 2018, so I would definitely love some Gob/Tony to help get me pumped for it! These two idiots were the best part of Season 4 IMHO, and I would love to see them somehow break out of the roofie circle and actually find the happiness they do not even begin to deserve, because terrible people developing genuine feelings for each other while still being absolutely terrible (to each other, to themselves, and to others around them) is among my favorite things. I think it would be particularly hilarious if all the drama around Lucille 2's apparent murder and the accidental FakeBlock scam and Lindsay's political campaign is playing out around them and has all the other Bluths in frantic damage control mode, but Gob hardly even what's going on (unless/until it involves them, because Sally almost certainly would throw Tony under the bus to save her own skin), because he's so preoccupied by his own confusing feelings. And/or just trapped in his own roofie circle. (Heh, if you like crossovers, maybe said circle finally ends with Gob and Tony both overdosing and/or getting murdered as a result of the others' scheming and ending up as "soulmates" in "The Good Place.") Basically, go wild. Bring the funny, and I'm on board.

Hot Fuzz (2007) 
Danny Butterman, Nicholas Angel

Yeah, so...I love this movie, and I love Nicholas and Danny, and yes, I ship it. I absolutely 100% ship it, but I'll happily read gen if you don't! I'd be up for anything post-movie, from casefic to hurt/comfort to slow-build romantic shipfic to pure comedy where the other cops just say "piss it" and shove them together, because while Danny would probably be clear-headed about the fact that he's fallen in love with Nicholas, Nicholas is canonically *terrible* at feelings and would likely worry about everything -- whether Danny returned his feelings, whether it would ruin their friendship, whether he'd just be destined to screw everything up again like he did with Janine, whether he'd be taking advantage, not to mention the ethical implications now that he's technically Danny's boss, etc. (Re: "gay revelation" angst, some amount of it is fine, but if you do go this route, I'd prefer it be more along the lines of "figuring oneself out" rather than any really dark internalized homophobia. Nicholas at least strikes me as highly unlikely to think it's *wrong*, but also a bit repressed and maybe some measure of grey-area asexual, such that he's just never given it much thought.)

...or you could just skip all that and go with an established relationship, whatever floats your boat. ;) Either way, bonus points for Doris showing up to make at least one horrific but very, very accurate double entendre.

As far as plot ideas, if you want to write something more than just shipfic or you'd prefer to write gen...I love actual plot, so have at it! If you have your own idea already, do that! I look forward to it. If you prefer prompts, though...maybe they've been called into assist with strange goings-on in another mad small town? (If you're at all into crossovers, maybe old and grey Steed and Mrs Peel have taken up temporary residence there to conduct their own investigation?) Or maybe Nicholas is called back to the Met to help with something there, and brings Danny along? Anything!

Pushing Daisies 
Ned (Pushing Daisies), Charlotte "Chuck" Charles, Lily Charles, Vivian Charles

Now that Lily and Vivian finally have Chuck back in their lives...what's next? Seriously, what's next? "I'm alive" makes for a lovely ending to the series, but c'mon, there's going to be a next. And sure, I'm perfectly convinced it all works out in the end, but it *is* going to take some working out. Are Lily and Vivian furious with Ned? Does he properly explain his powers to them? What about the *huge* loose end involving Charles Charles still being alive? Does Lily, in turn, have some bombshell information for Vivian and Charlotte about just what kind of slimeballs Charles and Dwight Dixon really were? Is Ned's father somehow the least evil of the three? (I mean, seriously. It would take a hell of a lot of backstory to make the case that his abandonment of Ned and later of Maurice and Ralston was somehow in any way necessary and he's not a bad guy at all -- though if you think you can make that case, go for it! -- so he probably is, at least, not a great guy, but given his rescue of Ned and Olive, is he maybe not as bad as they think? And would Lily know that and be able to tell Ned? Hell, would she want to tell him, given that she's probably pissed as hell that he kept the secret of her daughter being alive again?) If you want to bring in Olive, does she somehow help them solve their issues (and does *she* finally get let into the loop herself, as she so richly deserves)? Feel free to keep this as light or as serious in tone as you want, and to bring in any other characters you want!

Dark Tower - Stephen King 
Susannah Dean (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Susan Delgado (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Roland Deschain (Dark Tower - Stephen King), Eddie Dean (Dark Tower - Stephen King)

Please see letter for even more details.

This is a "please write about some assortment of these characters" request, not a "you must write about all of them" request. Though if you want to write an AU that involves all four of them, that would be awesome.

I would love ka-tet fic; I didn't request Jake and Oy only due to the character limit but I love them too so feel free to include them. I'd also be happy with a pre-Jake story with just Roland, Eddie, and Susannah. Or a story with just Roland and Susan. Etc. I really like how the characters relate to each other, so I would prefer a story with more than one of them... unless you want to just write about Susan. I would be completely happy with that. I like Susan a lot and there's a lot of story possibilities that would make more sense with just her.

If you want to write about Susan, I'd love to see what might have happened to her if she'd survived, with or without Roland. What would have gone differently if she'd become a part of his Alain-Cuthbert-Jamie ka-tet? Would she and Roland have ended up questing for the Tower, and maybe caught in the endlessly repeating cycle together, growing ever-older, more knowledgeable, and wearier? If she survived but Roland died, would she have inherited his guns and his quest? Would she have gone questing with their child, maybe a daughter, mirroring him with Jake?

Or, to be less epic, I loved the world and the character relationships, so I would also be totally happy with a day-in-the-life that shows more of Mid-World and more of the characters. Or a day-in-the-life beyond the doors. I loved every minute of Roland reacting to our world. We saw how he felt about Pepsi--imagine him at an ice cream parlor.

DNW: Rape, really gross descriptions, Jake/anyone. Please don't do anything worse than happens to the characters in canon; note that this gives you plenty of leeway. ;)

The Stand - Stephen King 

Please see letter for even more details - I have prompts for all the characters.

I love this book for its haunting vision of travel across an empty America, its small community on the edge of destruction, and its characters. 

So, characters: seriously, any of them, in any combination. Also, feel free to bring in anyone in canon not in the tagset. I initially meant to just request the characters I'd nominated, but when I saw the others in the tagset I kept changing my mind about which four to request, and I finally decided not to decide. Please decide for me. ;)

I love the leads and the minor characters, and I would be happy with a day in the life or an untold adventure or some sort of canon AU. What if Nick had been just in time to prevent the bomb instead of just too late? What if different characters ended up in Boulder or in Vegas? I really liked how it wasn't a clear split between good and evil, with apparently basically decent people like Angie Hirschfeld ending up in Vegas and some real jerks in Boulder. What made people choose as they did? What if choice or chance led them another way? What if some of the people who meant to flee Vegas, like Jenny Engstrom, did so earlier and escaped or met up with the travelers on the road?

DNW: Graphic gross descriptions. On-page rape. I don't like Dayna's rape backstory in the extended edition; please don't reference it. Flagg's general rapeyness with Nadine is fine, and if you do an AU where Nadine survives her encounter with him, referencing it is fine too. Basically don't add additional rape to what's already in canon, and you're fine.

While scary, bittersweet, melancholy, or even hearbreaking moments (or a general mood) are fine - it's obviously not a fluffy canon - please don't do anything worse to the characters than happens in canon. (Except for Flagg. Torture him all you like. ;) ) If there's hurt, I'd like comfort too. If there's tragedy, I'd also like some hope.

Ki and Vandien Quartet - Megan Lindholm 
Vandien (Ki and Vandien Quartet), Ki (Ki and Vandien Quartet)

Please see letter for more details.

I love the strange creatures of the world, and how they seem more like science fiction aliens than fantasy beings. But most of all, I love Ki and Vandien and their relationship, and how it’s solidly built on friendship and camaraderie.

I would like a story about Ki and Vandien. Feel free to set it at any time in their relationship, from right after they first get back together in Harpy’s Flight, to after the end of Luck of the Wheels. There’s a number of important points in their relationship that happen off-page, like when they first have sex, when they first get serious, etc, that would be fun to explore. Or you could pick up on any of the dropped story threads: do they ever meet Janie again? Or the Harpies? Or the Brurjans? (I love the Brurjans.) Does Ki ever learn more about the mysterious aspects of her past? Does she ever meet Vandien’s horrible family and give them hell? 

DNW: Canon character or pet animal death. (Deaths of monster animals or hunting for food is fine.) If someone dies in canon, referencing it's fine, but please don't kill any canon characters who don't die in canon. Depressing endings. (Bittersweet is fine.) Sexual violence.

Earthsea - Ursula K. Le Guin 
Vetch (Earthsea), Penthe (Earthsea), Yarrow (Earthsea)

Please see letter for more details - I have prompts for all the characters. 

The first two books of this series are two of my favorite fantasies of all time. I like the others to varying degrees, but those are my favorites. The characters I requested are meant as a "I would be happy with any of them" prompt, NOT as a "you must include them all" prompt. I love all the nominated characters (well, to read about; I don't love Kossil as a person) so feel free to include any of the ones I didn't request. I very nearly requested "any," but upon reflection I decided to go for my favorite characters who have very little fic about them. 

DNW: Character or animal death. Depressing endings. Sexual violence, child abuse, domestic violence, anything along those lines. Sex more explicit than canon (i.e., it can clearly be taking place but we don't know exactly what's going where when.)

Tale of the Five Series - Diane Duane 

Please see letter for more details - I have prompts for all the characters. 

I love the sense of wonder mixed with mundane detail, with the doors leading to other worlds where if you reach your hand through you can feel the heat of the air, the innkeeper who turns out to be the Goddess, telepathy that can be wondrous or just annoying, the tenderness and love the characters feel for each other, the sweet sensuality, the defiant optimism in a world that is centrally constructed around the acknowledgment of death, and the beauty and harshness of the flame that everyone wants and that kills you young. 

I love all these characters and would be happy with an ensemble story or with any pair (or pairing) of them, or a solo story. I also love the characters who were not nominated, so if you want to bring in Freelorn or Sunspark, say, that's totally fine.

DNW: Canon character or animal death. (Deaths of monster animals like the nightmare are fine.) If someone dies in canon, referencing it's fine, but please don't kill any canon characters who don't die in canon. Depressing endings. Bittersweet is fine, and I love the specific type of bittersweet in this canon, of self-sacrifice and heroic last stands and willingly giving one's life to a doomed but righteous cause. I am fine with an OC heroically sacrificing their life. Referencing the canon rape backstory is fine but please don't add additional rape to what's already in canon.

Aldnoah.Zero (Anime & Manga) 
Slaine Troyard, Klancain (Aldnoah.Zero)

I love this canon's dramatic plots in action, so if you are interested in writing gen and/or worldbuilding, I couldn't help thinking that the series ended with a brilliant set-up for the scandal to be uncovered in the far future, and for the specter of Terrorist Slaine Troyard who ought to have been executed be revealed somehow. What sort of legacies have been left by Asseylum's decisions? Could the people involved find common ground? Even if Slaine and Klancain have shared interests, can they support her effectively? And of course, how will the people who knew and didn't know cope with the consequences of the truth?

If you're interested in writing character-focused content or (my little heart can hope) shipfic, I'd love for curiosity to get the better of Klancain when it comes to Slaine (as a person and as a part of Asseylum). Since they traded barbs about Count Cruhteo's influence, Klancain having met Slaine near to his worst self, I would love something involving Klancain's curiosity about the wreck of a human being that Slaine is and what exactly is in him that Asseylum can't bear to lose him even though his (wretched) survival is the sort of secret that could topple empires. How could someone so smart make so many wrong choices? Casual intrigue leads to interpersonal drama and deepening entanglements! Learning about his empress through her dearest and most troubled choices in crisis could be in a series of vignettes.
Jealousy and possessiveness and power dynamics?! I'm curious to see what shape the tension between them takes.

If you want to just take these two and their weird connections and do a fantasy reimagining, I might cry tears of joy.

Flip Flappers (Anime) 
Cocona (Flip Flappers), Yayaka (Flip Flappers)

Yayaka's storyline broke my heart in this show, I love her and her ferocious ambition and her concern for Cocona. I'd love anything that explores their friendship or their corner of the YaPiCo love triangle-- during the past when Yayaka established herself as Cocona's friend or in the moments when those feelings became real. Yayaka's struggle to accept herself and her feelings over the course of the show felt to me very much like struggling with compulsory heterosexuality and the way teens sometimes wrestle with untangling platonic and romantic loves. How does their experience of each other and their friendship blossom once deceit is out of the way?

The two of them exploring Pure Illusion together, or dealing with the doors/gates into the emotional landscapes of others and reality shifts their actions within them cause could also make for a very interesting story-- What sort of previous experience with those gates did Yayaka have to warn Cocona not to mess with them? What repercussions are there for meddling in and with them over time?

selector infected WIXOSS 
Kurebayashi Kazuki, Kurebayashi Yuzuki

Warning: This is a request for canonical twincest.

So, I keep thinking about Kazuki's feelings being ambiguous and the implication that wishes have to have the selector's own direct action to come true or create the "win conditions" of the game. There's Yuzuki's inference that the dreams have to be possible to come true, a very tidy way for her to resolve any guilt about changing her brother's feelings for her with magic-- though it could also be that her desire to be with him publicly and openly changes the world they'll grow into rather than their feelings. If you want to go down a dark path, Kazuki's experience of feeling his worldview change and being unable to return to the state he knows he was in before would make for an awesome horror story. 

That said, I also love Yuzuki and want her to be happy, even if that (to her) means sibling incest happily ever after, with the loving support of her friends. Their first time or struggling to keep under wraps to the rest of the world, any engagement with the rest of their family, or making their time together count and the lengths they go to in order to be and stay together would be fun and interesting, too. I just couldn't believe they got as close to a happy end as this canon seems to offer just about anyone, despite the odds.

機動戦士ガンダム 鉄血のオルフェンズ | Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans 
Yamagi Gilmerton, Kudelia Aina Bernstein, Atra Mixta, Chad Chadan

Heartwrenching and/or uplifting post-canon or timeskip content for some of my precious surviving cast is the gist of what I am going for, with a heavy dose of found family. They deserve to get to be happy and feel safe and loved! It is my deepest hope that this crop of characters have beautiful romantic moments of joy AND MAYBE SOME ANGST OR SURVIVORS GUILT ABOUT THAT because they're all so keenly aware of the absences in their lives going forward. I would love to see the four of them working a healthier, happier future and encouraging one another to move forward. If you want to aim for a plot that doesn't center romance and recovery, practical concerns about building their new identities and their integration into their post-canon lives would be super satisfying for me. 

On the shipping fronts, regarding Atra and Kudelia, I would so love something about their OBVIOUS MARRIAGE DURING THE TIMESKIP or fretful preparation for Akatsuki's birth or far-future sitting together in rockers looking out at the farm! The Tekkadan-Admoss Foundation crew dealing with Kudelia's work pulling her away from the family and sweet reunions would be wonderful. I want to see them take on adulthood together in this world they made. 

If you are more interested in their bond growing while they are working with Tekkadan, I would really enjoy their time in space together, and Atra's firm resolve to build loving connections and the rejection of rivalry in their dynamic. Atra grounding Kudelia with loving openness, and Kudelia sharing her hopes and plans so that the two of them can see it through together. They are so precious to each other from the start, I really enjoy the way their bond evolves along friendship and respect to loving comfort. Laying in each other's arms talking about hope, inspiring each other to be the version of themselves their kids will need...They can save the world. Chad noticing Yamagi and slowly examining his own feelings as they push ever-forward...The foundations being laid for the future we're shown could be just a few moments of meaningful interactions. I was so delighted to see Chad blushing and getting teased about wanting to take out Yamagi after the timeskip, I would love something set during those ~5 years showing the path Chad and Yamagi took growing closer and maybe finding the beginning of a relationship, or something post-canon focusing on what they seem to be reaching for in each other even after the many tragedies of their lives. I love the idea of Chad's gentle warmth reaching Yamagi across his grief and Yamagi's sharpness leaving Chad feeling like he is totally readable/obvious while they both struggle through their feelings.

I JUST WANT THEM TO FIND HAPPINESS TOGETHER SOMEDAY ;0; Finally admitting how they feel over a drink or three? Awkward deliberate courtship or accidental realization that they are already kind of dating? I will be so happy for these two to curl up together in a corner of engine maintenance or administration and just be close and happy, after everything. I love domesticity for them if you feel like showing one crystallized moment of connection-- like Chad with his hair wrapped for night-time and Yamagi still grease-smudged from system work sharing hot tea with rum in the small hours when the rest are sleeping, or helping with the kids at Dante's or on the farm.

Tenkuu no Escaflowne | The Vision of Escaflowne 
Dilandau Albatou, Celena Schezar, Jajuka (Escaflowne)

Protective Lion Boyfriend!!!! Dilandau so desperately needed positive connections, the impact of discovering Jajuka in the series and their backstory was a hugely intense part of the canon for me. I just love the brief, intense glimpses of their time together and I NEED MORE OF THAT. I would love anything exploring their relationship, especially if it folds in Dilandau's trauma around his identity and what his position demands of him. Moments of comfort, moments of distress or dismay, and the sense that there is a force beyond all of their power pushing and pulling people and events-- the atmosphere of clinging to one another or losing everything and the devotional desperation Jajuka has to preserve even an ounce of safety for Dilandau buried somewhere within themselves is amazing. Formative bonds and love and co-dependence are all candy I will devour. If you feel like exploring Jajuka's mixed feelings about what he can do for Dilandau and Celena and what he IS doing and whether or not it is really helpful I will be delighted, having failed to find Jajuka stuff before. How has he helped Celena and Dilandau to coexist within one another, or can they?

バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Miracle Examiner 
Hiraga Josef Kou, Roberto Nicholas

- Casefics, casefics, all the casefics, all the deliciously weird casefics with all the life-and-death situations you can think of. Cave-ins! Blizzards! Death traps rooms! Ambushes and kidnappings! Cuddling for warmth! Protecting each other! More snakebites and weird amazing hallucinations! Evil cultists! Helpful application of sulphuric acid!
- Alternately, I have this craving for the strange domesticity of their Vatican life; maybe Roberto and Hiraga moving together and navigating the shores of their life together? Dinners and shopping and taking care and this easy, benign understanding they have for each other (honestly, I was dead and gone on the canon from their very scene together, where Hiraga admits to playing his game for the whole night in hopes that it would somehow help his little brother, and Roberto just going with it without missing a beat - and then, well, going to clean and iron for Hiraga, as one does).
- For some reason I'd really love an old-fashioned sickfic for this fandom. Fever, pain, tender care, gentle blanket-tucking... It just feels like it would really suit. (Somehow I feel it combines well with the previous option)
- I'm sure this wasn't the last time Julia had tried to convert them both to his case, and the events in the finale will most definitely come back to haunt them. So, how?
- Somebody once described Roberto's feelings for Hiraga as 'pining while already being in committed relationship,' and just. Yes. Hiraga is at once so obviously full of love, and so oblivious of it, that there are endless possibilities for angst here, and I want all of them.
- ...on unrelated note, I feel like this is the canon where I can actually mention, in Yuletide, that I have a crucifixion kink a mile wide. So, I have a crucifixion fic a mile wide, and Roberto is an ideal candidate.
- Bonus option: If you like to serious-ify a cracky canon, go for it! The show uses a very anime kind of Catholicism, mostly aesthetics and trappings, but I'm fascinated with how injecting a bit of the real deal will change things (or not): the actual everyday application of faith, you know? For example, we know from the novels that Hiraga is a true believer but Roberto mostly treats his position as a job that gives him access to old books; I wonder if the canon events changed it, for both of them.
- A completely non-obligatory bonus ridiculous crossover option on the chance you're into VME and Wynnona Earp at once: how would Roberto and Hiraga deal with the case that includes actual magic and demons from Hell?

If you like Lauren, I'm of the opinion that Lauren makes everything better (and makes for an ideal outsider's POV). 

Fandom-specific DNW caveat:
- For me, the allure of this relationship, given that both of them are priests, is that they are completely devoted to each other, but they're also at peace with being celibate. I'd prefer to see the same setup in fic - so, no sex between them, and also no angst about having to be celibate.

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades. I love hurt/comfort mostly within the context of a relationship (not necessarily romantic - filial ties, friendship, brothers-in-arms comradeship, whichever fits), as an opening for one character to be hurt and for the other to be outraged/terrified/comforting on their behalf.
- Found families, tight friendships, us-against-the-world, people finding and keeping each other, providing kindness and warmth against the dark.
- Hope and kindness, Clair universes, stories where the entropy tries its hardest but doesn't win.
- Loyalty in all forms! From ritualized (oaths, kneeling, ring-kissing, knights and bodyguards and henchmen and so on) to more casual ways, like standing up for your friends.
- Self-sacrifice (metaphorical and quite literal) and martyrdom (ditto).
- Non-mundane, tropey AUs - space opera! high fantasy! historical! pirates!
- Outsider POVs.

General DNWs:
- Character death.
- Infidelity and partner betrayal of any kind.
- Hurt without comfort.
- A/B/O universes and mpreg.

琅琊榜 | Nirvana in Fire (TV) 
Lin Shu | Mei Changsu | Su Zhe

I've left other character fields blank because I think he interacts gloriously with just about anybody. There will be some specific characters mentioned in the prompts below, but if you like the prompt and think it would work better with a different person, ignore the character suggestion altogether!
Same with shipping: I think MCS is very much a little black dress of this fandom, so if you have a specific ship in mind (Jingyan, Nihuang, Lin Chen, Meng Zhi, Jingrui, hell, even Liyang, anybody else) - go for it! I literally love everybody in this bar. 

So:
- In general, MCS goaded so far beyond his (emotional or physical) endurance that he has to actually admit he needs help and accept it.
- MCS surviving the end of the story and being forced to live with himself (for however long it is): a long, slow recovery, the life after revenge and death he never thought he could have, dealing with all these bits and pieces of himself and other people he thought he would never have to deal with.
- MCS and his household - fretting over him, doing his bidding, dealing with the fallout of his schemes, passing judgement on his favored and disfavored people, preparing for holidays and so on. I loved his interactions with Li Gang and Zhen Ping and Fei Liu so, so much.
- MCS and Jiangzhuo Alliance - his rise to power, his politics, the way he made it flourish; mostly because I fell in love with him from the very first scene when he floated out in this ridiculous self-steering boat with his flute and three warships full of soldiers just about died in terror. You know? COMPETENCE PORN.
- Some kind of scenario where people of the capital come to MCS during his stay there for a solution for their problems because the rumors travel quickly that he can solve them, and he does, a-la Sherlock Holmes, just to keep his hands busy (and maybe gather favors).
- This might be a bit of an overkill for a canon like NiF, but literally any kind of h/c, casefic scenario you can think about? Bring it on. Like huddling for warmth (was there ever a character made more perfectly for the huddling for warmth trope than MCS?), or caved-in, or a kidnapping, or recovering from the wounds, or being caught in an ambush, or being imprisoned in a dungeon (AGAIN), or being interrogated (AGAIN AGAIN), or what have you.
- People forcing MCS to admit that they quite literally love him (or came to love him) as Mei Changsu, as this new persona, and kind of guiding him towards loving himself as Mei Changsu too. Or at least forgiving himself, for surviving. 

And so on, and so on, this is only a tiny sliver I can think of; honestly, give me anything, please, because there are only so many times I can rewatch those fifty-four episodes.

And some fandom specific DNW caveats:
- The setting and the setup are a huge part of the enjoyment for me, so this is the fandom where I'd prefer not to read AUs or canon divergence stories (until it's the finale or post-finale canon divergence), soulbonding AUs and such.
- Stories set before the present storyline (in short, I'm interested in MCS-LS but not Lin Shu only as Lin Shu). 

The same things that worked for me in the show would work for me in fics: hurt/comfort, sarcasm, dramatic irony, plot twists, complicated relationships, friendship and loyalty, people being really reverent with their mothers, determination and self-sacrifice, the way everybody fusses over MCS-LS, the warmth of the household interludes, the whiplash between epic and mundane. 

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades.

Pyre (Video Game) 
Hedwyn (Pyre), Jodariel (Pyre), The Moon-Touched Girl (Pyre), Rukey Greentail

I was blown away by how gorgeous and how kind this game was, melancholy but not hopeless, and how hard it leaned on found family tropes, and how fast and how hopelessly I was invested in the fates of all the new Nightwings, together and apart, but especially the core crew, the ones you begin with. So I'd love to read something about them in whatever permutation of events, finding their way to each other. 

(Feel free to include each and every other character, if you're so inclined, ditto the Reader; mine was of a female/disabled/scholar persuasion). 

Some ideas!
- All of them upside, building a new life together alongside with Volfred's revolution.
- Some went up and some stayed down: missing each other, or writing letters to each other, or literally moving heaven and earth to meet again because they can't not.
- Moon-Touched Girl upside, the accidental Prophet of the Scribes, and the way the rest of them keep her safe and grounded.
- Sort of an orphanage pre-canon AU where Jodariel takes care of all of them, not just Hedwyn?
- All of them left below, after the end, making the Downside into something to fit in rather than a place of exile;
- Just general... caretaking, trauma recovery scenarios, in whatever combination: sharing pasts, teaching each other to love and live, providing shelter in the storm.
- Weird adventures on the road when it's just four or them (plus or minus the Reader), before the big games begin - Howler ambushes and tales around the campfire and exhaustion of the travel and kind of horrible but still beautiful sights, and the stars.
- Space opera, of the rickety-ship-stern-captain-hapless-stowaway persuasion?
- Some kind of procedural with a tough detective Jodariel and her original and accidental wards?

Mostly I'm just very, very, ridiculously invested in the ties between the four of them, forever, always.

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it.

Baahubali (Movies) 
Sivagami (Baahubali)

Sivagami, loving murder queen of my heart! For me those movies were all about her rise and downfall, and I want a story, any story about her - I've left the other character slots open to give you the most flexible timeline choice, so please feel free to include whoever you want, I love (or love to hate) all of them. Some possible prompts:

- Her backstory, rise to power, political maneuvering that went into her taking over the palace, et cetera. Did she have friends, did she have lovers, how did she make her alliances, did she want to be the one to hold the country together or did she do it out of duty?
- Sivagami and her serving ladies (femslash or gen are both good!).
- Her relationship with Amarendra's mother prior to the lady's death; was there more to her adopting Amarendra as her own beloved son than what we're shown?
- More on her relationship with Amarendra before everything went to shit, because the beginning of the second movie, with the interrupted ritual and them him caring for her when she was sick brought me so, so much joy.
- Sivagami and Kattappa, oaths and loyalty and trust and overwhelming love they shared for Baahubali the senior, and the way it all fell apart (or maybe didn't).
- ...Some fix-its please? The most heartwrenching thing in the whole movie for me was that they didn't have a chance to reconcile before Amarendra died. A story where things didn't go wrong, an afterlife reunion, some redemption?
- And in the fixit AU vein, Sivagami and Devasena overcoming the initial clusterfuck of their acquaintance and working together, in whatever capacity? Mentor and pupil, or friends, or even respectful enemies, but with more - sense of each other.
- Or Sivagami who lived and raised Baahubali in the village below in full knowledge of his inheritance?
- Or just AUs, because I could see her being a terrifying loving mother and grandmother BAMF in literally whatever universe and position she chose to occupy. Ruthless politician Sivagami, pirate queen Sivagami, High Priestess Sivagami, just, ahh. 

...and more, and more, and more. If you're into unusual formats, maybe her letters (I'm sure she's a very, hm, direct correspondent), or some later legends concerning her, or an epic song about her rule, et cetera. Just - more of her please. 

General things I like:
- Hurt/comfort! All the hurt/comfort, you can't do wrong (or be too hardcore) with it. Physical h/c, emotional h/c, captivity scenarios, caretaking, whipping, dungeons, bullet wounds, you name it and i've been into it for decades. I love hurt/comfort mostly within the context of a relationship (not necessarily romantic - filial ties, friendship, brothers-in-arms comradeship, whichever fits), as an opening for one character to be hurt and for the other to be outraged/terrified/comforting on their behalf.
- Found families, tight friendships, us-against-the-world, people finding and keeping each other, providing kindness and warmth against the dark.
- Hope and kindness, Clair universes, stories where the entropy tries its hardest but doesn't win.
- Loyalty in all forms! From ritualized (oaths, kneeling, ring-kissing, knights and bodyguards and henchmen and so on) to more casual ways, like standing up for your friends.
- Self-sacrifice (metaphorical and quite literal) and martyrdom (ditto).
- Non-mundane, tropey AUs - space opera! high fantasy! historical! pirates!
- Outsider POVs.

General DNWs:
- Character death.
- Infidelity and partner betrayal of any kind.
- Hurt without comfort.
- A/B/O universes and mpreg.
- Grimdark stories and unhappy endings.
- PWPs.

All Seeing Eye - Rob Thurman 
Jackson Lee Eye, Hector Allgood

OK, the first thing I should say about this canon is that I really enjoy all of the other nominated characters (Abigail "Abby" (All Seeing Eye), Meleah Guerrera), as well, and if you want any of them to make appearances, I’m more than good with that. ^_^ So why request this particular set of characters?

One of the most compelling parts of the book to me is the enemies-to-friends(-to-lovers? ^_~) thing going on between Jackson and Hector. I absolutely love the entire arc of their developing friendship from angry and antagonistic to deep-seated trust and practical co-dependency. Anything that looks at that friendship (or romance, if you want to look at it that way!) through that lens is something I’d really enjoy.

More specific prompts available in my DYA letter.

DNWs (do not wants):
1) I prefer to keep other kinds of AUs (i.e. coffeehouse AUs, high school AUs, etc.) to my larger fandom explorations. For exchanges, I prefer to stay closer to actual canon.
2) I have a huge fealty/loyalty kink, and discussions of infidelity/cheating/going behind someone's back/etc., make me highly uncomfortable. So, if you could avoid that kind of thing, I'd appreciate it.
3) I have a huge embarrassment/public humiliation squick, so if you could avoid that, I'd be grateful.
4) I’m a veterinarian and an animal lover and any talk of animal abuse or animal death makes me really upset. So, if there are any animals in your stories, I’d appreciate it if none of them were hurt or killed, and that they are all treated with care and respect. Thanks!
5) The following kinks: Age play/infantalism, scat, watersports, a/b/o dynamics/omegaverse. Basically, if I haven't listed it as something I'd like for a particular story, please just don't include it. Thanks!

Either way, though, I just really, really love him and would love to see more of him. ^_^ I also have no objection to the other characters in the tagset (Daemon Sadi, Jaenelle Angelline, Karla (Black Jewels), Saetan SaDiablo, Surreal SaDiablo) making appearances in the story.

Dark Is Rising Sequence - Susan Cooper 
Bran Davies (Dark Is Rising), Will Stanton

I don’t remember exactly when I first read these books, but they’ve been perennial favorites for some time. I’ve been meaning to request them for Yuletide for years and keep managing to forget. NOT THIS YEAR. Anyway, what I love about them is that old-time myth and legend feel and how connected they feel to autumn and winter for me. I honestly can’t even put it into words. Suffice to say, I love them, and every time I come back to them, they still manage to feel fresh and new, like I remember the overall shape of them but the details blur between readings. As such, I haver fewer plot-related prompts to offer, as I’m still in the middle of my current reread, but if there’s something specifically plot-related you want to explore, I’m totally down for that, too.

I’ll also be up front about this: I ship Bran and Will a LOT. It’s that deep, almost mystical connection between the two of them that exists from the moment they meet that utterly captivates me. However, if you’re more into exploring that on a platonic/gen level, I’m down for that, too. ^_^ As mentioned in the general likes/dislikes section, I also have a HUGE fealty/loyalty kink, and Will and Bran definitely have a healthy helping of that going on. It may look different because this is modern day, but it’s clear in many of their interactions that Will kind of… belongs to Bran, very much in a king/vassal kind of way. He has all this power at his beck and call, and you just get the feeling that nothing would make him happier than to lay that all at Bran’s feet for whatever he needs. Very “command me and I’m yours,” and I LOVE that dynamic. Not so sure I’d be into that playing out in a sexual way, though, if you want to take this in a shippy direction. I like them on more equal footing when it comes to relationship explorations.

Ephemera Series - Anne Bishop 
Danyal (Ephemera), Lee (Ephemera)

It occurs to me that I have re-read a lot of Anne Bishop this year and it really shows in my sign-ups. O_o;;; ANYWAY. For some reason, with each passing re-read, I fall further and further in love with these two characters. I am always a sucker for the self-sacrificing types who may angst quietly to themselves but would never even dream of not helping the people who need them. And both of these characters fit into that archetype, though Lee a bit more so than Danyal. More importantly, though, I absolutely love how they manage to get each other past that and form a truly supportive and thriving partnership where both can live fully up to their strengths and potential. And, for the record, I love their canon friendship, but I’d also love to see them romantically shipped, so whichever way you want to go there is fine by me!

Tir Alainn Trilogy - Anne Bishop 
Morag (Tir Alainn Trilogy), Ashk (Tir Alainn Trilogy), Padrick (Tir Alainn Trilogy)

…I mentioned I was doing a lot of Anne Bishop re-reading this year, yes? Third and last time she appears in the requests. ^_^ SO. I love these three. I just really, really do. I love Ashk and Morag’s friendship, how well they understand each other, how, in each other, they’ve finally found someone else who can match their strength, who wouldn’t be afraid of them just because of who they are. I love Padrick and Ashk’s relationship, how Padrick not only accepts, but revels, in Ashk’s strength but still looks for opportunities to pamper her and show her a little softness, how he loves the Green Lady and respects and follows the Hunter and everything in between. And I love Padrick and Morag’s friendship, how he treats her to that same tough love and kindness that he does Ashk, how he revels in the fact that he gets to stand by her side and see that she’s taken care of, not just because Ashk would want it, but because, in his own way, he loves her, too. I love how he sees so easily that Morag has been starved for simple things like friendship and affection from all but her sister and is eager to coddle her and take of her, but is equally easy with stepping aside and accepting her lead, how he just lets her be who she is, like Ashk. I just love the entire dynamic between these three. ^___________^

The White Mists of Power - Kristine Kathryn Rusch 
Abington Byron Adric, Seymour (The White Mists of Power - Kristine Kathryn Rusch)

I loved this book so much as a kid, so much so that I think it influenced a lot of the tropes (…and kinks) I now love as an adult. There was something about it that just stuck with me, and I ended up revisiting it so many times over the course of my life that it’s become a comfort book for me. And one of the most compelling parts of the story to me is the relationship between Byron and Seymour. Byron, the charming bard and sometime rogue, who’s being hunted down for pissing off the wrong powerful lord once too often, but is determined to make a secure future for himself and for the people he comes to care about, too (like Seymour), and Seymour, the forever fearful amateur wizard, hunted by the same offended lord as Byron, his greatest crime being to be born the son of a great and powerful wizard… and not live up to his legacy. He wants nothing more than to hide away from everyone and everything and be a disappointment in peace, and yet somehow he and Byron make for the most unlikely of friends, a decision to help Byron being the thing that forces Seymour back into the land of the living, whether he wants it or not. That friendship, rocky though it often is, drives the entire story and I love everything about it.

Oxford Time Travel Universe - Connie Willis

Years after her brush with the Black Death Kivrin makes another journey through time. 

Yuletide friend, I always wondered what happened to Kivrin after her sojourn in the fourteenth century. Is she too traumatized to continue as a field historian? Does she stick to teaching in her own present day? Leave academia? Change disciplines? Keep on traveling to dangerous times, because she's sort of a badass? I’d kind of like to see her pushed to time travel again, maybe with some of the other beloved time traveling historians (Verity and Ned? I haven’t read Blackout/All Clear, so don’t know the others as well, but knock yourself out, include more characters if you wish). Also, I remember a statement in To Say Nothing of the Dog to the effect of “all history is a 10 for blacks” so they don’t time travel…which, no. Surely black historians also want to travel in time, even if it isn’t so easy for them to blend inconspicuously into the population of say, medieval England. I would be extra excited if Kivrin were to have a time traveling companion who pushes that boundary.

Brennu-Njáls saga | Njal's Saga 
Hallgerðr Hǫskuldsdóttir | Hallgerðr langbrók

I'd like to read more about Hallgerd than the saga(s) provide us. She is such a fascinating figure - and it is very clear the author of the Njals saga thinks so, too! He could have easily made her an evil bitch, yet chooses not to do so. I think there is a lot of points you could elaborate on. 

For example, what about her childhood? - I'm especially interested in her relationship with her mother and her brother Olaf Pai. (Was there a sibling rivalry - or did she maybe like him very much?) And where does her mysterious name "longbrok" come from?
Second, what about Thjostolf, her foster-father (that very much gives the impression of a would-be- or ex-lover, which today seems ...ahem... kinky)? Everyone in the saga seems to dislike him, only Hallgerd again and again excuses him (until he slays the husband she loves). Why?

And what makes her relationship to Glum seemingly the most healthy and loving relationship in her lifetime? What about little Thorgerd who loses her father? What does she think about her mother? (Heck, what does she think about her own strange bethrothal and marriage??? Thorgerd would be an absolutely fascinating person to write about. Feel absolutely free to write about Thorgerd!)
And Gunnar? Did Hallgerd ever truly love Gunnar - and if yes, why and when did she cease to do so? What did he see in her - not if all of his friends didn't warn him to not marry Hallgerd! 

You may absolutely write about all of the people in the tags (or anyone that merits a name in the saga) - yet I'm least interested in Bergthora.

Charité (TV) 
Schwester Therese

Da es derzeit keine englische Fassung gibt, ist es wohl okay, auf Deutsch zu schreiben. Mein größter Wunsch wäre auf jeden Fall: Mach's für die arme Schwester Therese wieder gut!!! Wenigstens ein bisschen!!! Ihre Story wurde ja so versaut, da weiß ich gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll. (Mehr dazu im Yuletide letter.)
Sie hat es sowas von verdient, zu Weihnachten ein bisschen Freude und Trost abzukriegen!
Ich glaube, es würde sich für eine Story vielleicht ganz gut eignen, einen Heiligabend in der Charité zu erzählen, was die verschiedenen Figuren da so erleben und wie sie feiern, auch wenn sie arbeiten müssen (oder es freiwillig tun). Es sollte trotz allem wenigstens ein bisschen schön für alle Figuren sein. Selbstverständlich kannst du gerne auch alle anderen Charas vorkommen lassen, speziell Ida und Oberin Martha bieten sich ja sehr an.

Kudrun 
Gerlint (Kudrun)

I really like the dynamics between the women of this epic. Especially Gerlint - Kudrun - Ortrun.
Gerlint  could have been shown so easily as simply the evil queen, but isn't. The author calls her "she-wolf" and tells of her cruel deeds and plans on Kudrun, yet in the same instance, shows her as competent queen, dutiful wife and loving mother who may have deserved death, but not like this and not what happened to her body. I love the complexity in this!
The relationship between Gerlint and Kudrun seems to have something of a hate-love, with not so little sexual undertones in the scene, where Gerlint plans to whip Kudurn by herself, with no one around. If you want to elaborate on this impression, I'm absoluteley fine with femslash.

And think of Ortrun, who seems to be the nicest person who ever lived! Caught between two stools, with her duty and love for her mother and brother - and on the other hand side her loyality and friendship (or is there even more?) for Kudrun. Comparing her to the other two women, she seems the weak one - but is she? She was the only one who dared to protest Kudrun's ill treatment - even if only by crying in public. 

And how did Hartmuot perceive all this? He seems a knight in shining armour, a good man through and through - and yet he did not gain the one he loved. 

Feel free to use as many people from the epic as you like. My favourite, though, would be Gerlint.

John Wick (Movies) 
John Wick (John Wick)

These prompts are far less involved than requests 2&amp;3 but please don't think I like it less, I just have less FEELINGS about this movie that need expositing and instead would love to see your take on anything! You really can't go wrong!

WORLDBUILD: I will love just about anything that examines the world John Wick lives in: the coins, the clothes, the guns, the bars, how does it all *work*? When does it break down? How does it get fixed? 

A few potential prompts:

John and his contacts! Who does he know, from where? I love the *respect* everyone has for him and what he was/is again.

John's (sex) life before his wife! (Porn optional) / John's INTRODUCTION to the life as a hitman.

John picking out his final inventory for his One Last Job with his wife watching on, *knowing* he will succeed.

John and his cars: I mean, it's clear he knows his wheels inside and out.

Who trained John? What was their relationship like? He had to learn the 'rules' somewhere.

Bonus points for anything involving folks having that turnpin reaction of 'Oh. John. I'l... leave you be" due to his reputation. They're some of my favourite parts of the movie.

The Goblin Emperor - Katherine Addison 
Maia Drazhar, Cala Athmaza, Deret Beshelar, Kiru Athmaza

I received a wonderful Goblin Emperor fic last year but this is the story full of feelings I would love to roll in forever, so I have requested again!

Points I'd Love Expanded On:

Maia and the fallout from his childhood:
We get a few tiny slivers of reactions from the cast when they learn about Maia's history and abuse. I would love to see how the Nohechari discuss it among themselves, how it changes how they interact with Maia and those around Maia. How they translate that into Maia's coping mechanisms for safety, and how little he worries about his own physical self.

Maia and his Meditation/His Nohechari's Presence:
Cala and Deret both are surprised that Maia thinks they would judge him for his need to meditate. Why? They clearly judge and inform him prior to this. I'd love the pair of them realizing how on guard Maia is around them, that their actions have had this effect, and that it isn't a benefit to anyone - least of all Maia.

Maia And His Health/Food/Identity:  The novel constantly repeats subtle nods at Maia's health: he skips his meals or eats little, has no appetite, has awful headaches, refuses to look at himself in the mirror, and others comment and ask if he's well. I feel he's disassociating from himself as a way to handle how little he recognizes who he has become. How that could be remedied or resolved? I'd prefer this to focus on it being a result of stress and fixing the issue, not as Maia with an eating disorder.

Maia and his kidnapping: When Maia's questioned, after being kidnapped, he admits plainly that he'd have signed his abdication knowing that it would mean his death. He's upset about this, but also resigned. I would love a look into how little Maia values his own life beyond the power he represents, and how that affects his staff.

World Build Bonus points: The practice of Nohecharei have been an institution for centuries and are always provided by a set group: There's no way that nothing was written, over the years, about best care and practice of guarding your Emperor against harm both inside and out. What rules are they trying to follow, or break? Or is there really no guideline at all?

Tangled: The Series (Cartoon) 
Cassandra (Disney: Tangled), Rapunzel (Disney: Tangled the Series)

This is one of those series I want to love SO MUCH but I struggle with how often it goes halfway with its ideas. What I really want, more than anything else, is some serious conversations between Rapunzel and Cassandra - conversations they really need to be having!

((This is getting a canon review tomorrow so these statements may get adjusted))

Cassandra forces Rapunzel to lie for her - and threatens her if she doesn't. This isn't the act of a friend, this is an act of abuse. And Cassandra is not a bad person! I'd really love Cassandra - who is far more world aware than Rapunzel is, educated and self sufficient - I'd love her to realize how much she takes advantage of Rapunzel and how messed up Rapunzel is from being abused and gaslit by Gothel for her whole life?

I'd likewise love to see Rapunzel take a stand against her father, because what the HECK series?? Rapunzel has gone from one tower to another, and I know the series tries to frame it as 'not good' but when Rapunzel's mother's suggestion is 'just hide your exploits from your father' and Rapunzel never once points out the similarities of her parents AND Gothel, I'm disappointed.
I've dealt with abuse my whole life and really identify with Rapunzel, I suppose, but the show makes her dumb as a brick sometimes and I'd love to see her brilliance - she's a genius engineer and amazing artist - actually shine. I'd love to see her gain a backbone and be able to make boundaries for herself.

For some reason, I feel she would go into law. As a lawyer, I mean, maybe because her dad was a lawyer and him trying to do the right thing is what started everything off. Probably also because I'm stuck on the idea of Roarke's young cousin Sean being the one who grows up to be a cop, and they've stayed in touch through Eve and Roarke's holiday gatherings, and end up on the same case with Eve a baffled background character. I have no idea. I just love Nixie's determination and grit and sense of right and wrong, and would love to see that in action.

I'm okay with only some of the characters being present in the story (I think one with all four would be tricky!). I'm curious about the aftermath, but any story would please me.

Specific things I wonder about, in case any of them intrigue or interest you: Does Leon get talked out of the dark-horse idea? By who, and in favor of what? What is Catalina going to do now that her power is known? Arabella? (Honestly, for Arabella, the other thing that could be fun is getting in the Arbiters' heads during the testing! Well, or Catalina, but really, Arabella.) For Kyle...what's it like being Kyle or, alternately, what happens when Rynda is told that about his magic? They DO tell her, right?

The Lions of Al-Rassan - Guy Gavriel Kay 
Jehane bet Ishak, Miranda Belmonte, Ammar ibn Khairan, Rodrigo Belmonte

This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I'm sure I'll love anything you write! That said, I've always been interested in the canon gaps. For example, what else happened during the year Ammar and Rodrigo served in Ragosa? What was the Belmontes' marriage like before they had children? How did Jehane and Ammar adjust to Sorenica?

I am also interested in points at which the story might have turned and gone in a different direction. Such alternate paths are probably equally likely to end in tragedy, alas, but new and different flavors of bittersweet are worth sampling. *wry*

I like all ship types and am open to any combination of Jehane, Ammar, Rodrigo, and Miranda. My only caveat is that I dislike cheating, so any ship involving Rodrigo or Miranda with someone besides each other requires them to give permission beforehand. But I would prefer that you focus at least as much on plot, character development, and world-building as on any potential sex and/or romance.

The Saga of the Skolian Empire - Catherine Asaro 
Rocalisa Qox-Skolia

This request is both very specific and very open-ended. Here is the specific part: Lisi leaves Prism as a young adult (use whatever plot justification works best for you), and encounters the giant tangle of post-Radiance War interstellar politics and its ramifications for her family. Here is the open-ended part: literally everything else.

I admit that I would love you forever if you can get Lisi to meet any of her relatives either in person or via the psiberweb (which is why I nominated Jai, Kelric, and Dehya), but that is not strictly necessary. Other things that would be received with great joy but which are not requirements include some kind of action/adventure plot and/or a romance. If that romance happened to be lesbian and/or poly, I would be even more thrilled -- canon is sadly short on lesbians, though we did get Althor being both bi and poly -- but again, that is a bonus rather than a demand.

If that prompt is really not working for you, here are some other ideas for Lisi-centric stories. Tell me about her growing up on Prism, or about returning to Prism to rebuild. Tell me about her years living on Earth with Seth: did she make friends; did she have a cute teenage romance; how hard was it to keep all the necessary secrets; did she adopt any pieces of Earth culture like Jai adopted Catholicism; etc. Just, tell me something about Lisi!

For this prompt, a focus on romance is obviously fine, though I would appreciate if you also put equal emphasis on at least one of the following: family, secrets, or action/adventure.

I admit upfront this is a peculiar character combination, and I hereby absolve you of having to write all four characters if you can't think of a way to fit them into the same story. But I would really like to see at least two of them, and see them interacting in a way that involves their professional lives rather than their romantic histories with Matt.

In other words, I want some kind of case!fic wherein Karen and/or Milla and/or Becky and/or Elektra get to exercise their various professional skillsets to resolve a problem. The scale can be as large or small as you like. You can pick whatever time period works best for your plot. Matt (and other characters) can be involved or not, as you please, though I would like the women to be at least as instrumental to the eventual resolution as he is. And if you can think of ways to work in any of the other women who have touched Matt's life over the years (whether lovers, friends, or enemies), that would be extra specially cool. :)

I genuinely don't care what you do with ships in this fic -- ship any of them, ship all of them, ship none of them, whatever! -- but romance should really not be the focus here, please.

The Dispossessed - Ursula K. Le Guin 

This is also one of my all-time favorite books, and I am sure I will love any story you write for it. I am not at all fussy! I like the characters, the utopianism and related politics and philosophy, the crazy alien physics, the world-building for both Urras and Anarres, etc. I am also totally up for fic about "The Day Before the Revolution" and the rest of Laia Odo's life, if that strikes your fancy.

If you want plot hooks, I am fascinated by the way marriage (or the lack thereof) plays out in Anarresti society, and what that means for Shevek and Takver. Relatedly, family also seems to be a slippery concept and I'm sure that could lead to an interesting story centered around Sadik and her parents (or grandmother, perhaps?), or about the friend-groups Shevek and Takver construct around themselves. I am intrigued by the hints of Odo's own relationship with Taviri, and their joint activism. I enjoy the throwaway mentions of Urrasti legends and would love to see them turned into proper mythology. I am curious about the chaos in Benbili that was going on while Shevek was on Urras, and/or the reaction to his journey back on Anarres. I'd love to hear about Ambassador Keng's reaction to Urras both pre- and post-Shevek. Etcetera, etcetera -- there are infinite options!

I like all ship types, but I would prefer that you focus at least as much on plot, character development, and worldbuilding as on any potential sex and/or romance. Also, please do not have Shevek or Takver cheat on each other, though if you want to do something in a consensual poly direction, that's totally fine.

The Innsmouth Legacy - Ruthanna Emrys 

If there’s a particular story you want to tell in this world, knock yourself out. I’m not   very well-versed in Lovecraft, but if there’s a Lovecraftian idea you’d like to see the characters deal with, I’m here for that. 

For all characters in this fandom, I’m less interested in backstory than in stories set after Winter Tide (or possibly during—I would like to see some of Charlie and Ron’s missing scenes). I’d love to see a future fic for Aphra dealing with the scope of her future—something set in the present day, or a hundred years from now, or a hundred thousand. But I’d also love a story about how she negotiates her relationships with Caleb, Charley, Neko, and Audrey over the next few months or years, or a story about Professor Trumbull settling back into her old life.

The Broken Earth Series - N. K. Jemisin 

I would like post-trilogy fic about any of the nominated characters who are still alive at the end (for any value of alive). I’m especially interested in the small-scale community-building of the Castrimas in their new home, but take the story wherever you want to—this fandom has scope, and I would also happily read about the coming civilizations that Essun and Hoa will witness.

Ella Enchanted - Gail Carson Levine 
Prince Charmont (Ella Enchanted Book), Mandy (Ella Enchanted Book), Ella of Frell (Ella Enchanted Book), Areida (Ella Enchanted Book)

Ella Enchanted was one of my literary heroines growing up, hence the username! Some ideas for a fic: 

-post-epilogue, featuring Char and Ella's adventures around the world.
-modern au retelling of the story (Featuring university and college culture)
-post-epilogue, purely romantic story, maybe going into the wedding and their children, and daily life at court (more fairy drama, perhaps?)
_zombie au? scifi au? I'm a sucker for a good au.

With this fandom, the only restriction I'd say I'd like there to be is explicit sex. I'm ok with some kisses and petting, but as it's a childhood favorite, I'd feel weird reading about Char and Ella kink-negotiating, or having a threesome with Areida.

This is what I like to call my comfort movie. Note that I haven't read the book, but if you have, do not worry about spoiling me for anything that happens in it. 

Some prompts:

-a continuation of the fight scene where Elizabeth learns of Darcy's meddling with Jane and Bingley (perhaps more clothes are cut off in the fray?)
-a story set immediately after the wedding, and the uprising of zombies running toward them. what's next? do darcy and elizabeth ever get their wedding night?
-elizabeth and darcy training together. going off to war together. being zombie kicking badasses together.
-modern au perhaps? a retelling or continuation of the story in the modern age. 

I am totally ok with some explicit sex with this fandom. Just no zombies in the bedroom, please. :)

Stardew Valley (Video Game) 
Shane (Stardew Valley), Abigail (Stardew Valley), Penny (Stardew Valley), Leah (Stardew Valley)

This game is just the best ever, isn't it? Now, to clarify, the four characters I chose are the ones I most like in the game, but I don't need all of them to be in the fic. Frankly,the whole cast is welcome in the fic, so if you think someone would be best suited in the fic, go for it! I just ask that at least one of my chosen characters is the focus of the fic.

Prompts for this fandom are harder for me to think of. Perhaps something a few days before the new farmer joins the town. Pelican Town is such a little town; how do they feel about this new person invading? Or maybe a background fic of their life before the farmer came to town. Leah's story with her ex, how Shane's drinking habit really got started (and his love for chickens), why Abigail started eating rocks...

I'm not looking for a romantic or explicit sex story here. A general, quirky, mostly light-hearted fic would be fine. No darker subjects than what the game already gives. (I know Shane contemplates suicide in the game, but I really, really prefer that suicide or suicidal thoughts are NOT in the fic at all.) This is my happy, relaxing game, and I'd like the fic to be of a similar genre.

League of Legends RPF 

A bit of a warning, this is the fandom that I warned about (please read DYA for context), and it’s definitely my current addiction. If you are someone who is also interested in this fandom but have certain pairings/players you prefer, please know that I would actually love absolutely anything you could possibly throw at me. If you would like to know my preferences, I am partial to faker/bengi, pray/gorilla, and kuro/gorilla(/smeb), but I am a fervent multishipper and will happily read stories about any pairing or player. 

I'm also a huge fan of AUs (as stated above), so if you're not interested in trying to learn all the intricacies of the esports scene, that's fine with me! (If, by chance, you somehow know about League’s esports scene, I would be totally fine if you included other people from any teams, I am extremely flexible)

If you'd like more specific prompts, here are some (a ton):

1) faker &amp; deft actually went to the same high school, so an AU where they didn't go pro? Would they still have met and how would that have gone? Can be gen or shippy. (Can also include bang, because he also went to that high school and is actually one of deft's childhood friends.)

2) faker can be a huge troll in soloq (eg: alistar support for cpt jack), give me some crack or maybe a five times fic where he trolls people in game or irl

3) smeb is notoriously over-the-top no homo, but he’s really into cuddling kuro. Give me some good old fashioned gay panic?

4) pray &amp; gorilla are the undisputed parents of longzhu, and I adore the longzhu family dynamic, so anything to do with that would be ace. pray is the dad who pretends to not care but is the nicer one that cheers up his younger teammates while gorilla is the mom that cares too much and nags a ton. They have apparently perfected the carrot &amp; stick dynamic, and gorilla has deemed “prilla” to mean “duo for life.” If that’s not true love, I don’t know what is??

5) Give me anything ex-rox (smeb, peanut, kuro, pray, gorilla) and I will love you forever. Give me AU where they stayed together, give me a completely different AU (HP/superhero/whatever), give me random anecdotes from their time playing together, because they’re a family T____T

6) I have a soft spot for smeb/score, especially for their stupid shenanigans on KT. stories of them bullying deft or pawn as the crazy duo, how they bonded, anything goes

7) I love bengi, I love faker, and I really miss having them on the same team together (they were together for four years!!) Maybe something with 2016 all stars shenanigans (including smeb, pray, cpt jack, and madlife if you’d like) or an AU where bengi doesn’t leave (please <strike>don’t</strike> break my heart) or... retirement AU.

Faking It (TV 2014) 
Amy Raudenfeld

I just want Amy to be happy. Legitimately, that's all I ever wanted in this show, and even when the last few episodes were obviously rushed, it ended with a happy Amy and that's all I need.

I'm fine with any pairing for Amy (preferably f/f, but I'll take anything), just show me a happy future for her. I actually do like Amy/Sabrina, so if you're worried about it, don't be! If you don't want to write anything shippy, gen is also amazing in my book.

Some more specific prompts:

1) College AU, moving away from Hester and how does that change things?

2) I've always liked Amy &amp; Shane's dynamic, so anything about their friendship would be awesome. Shane cheering her up after Sabrina, going people-watching, silly hijinks to get to the bottom of Booper, the world is your oyster~

3) Future fic, where is everyone fifteen years from now? (Does Lauren fulfill everything in her fifteen year plan? What’s Amy up to/is she happy, in a relationship, ??)

4) How does Amy deal with the fact that Karma/Felix is probably going to become a thing? Two of her crushes getting together, lemme see that reaction

Honestly, anything dealing with Robo’s deadpan humor is excellent in my book, and yeah, I like Robo/Youzan, even with how incredibly little we have to work with because of how very little they’ve interacted so far :D;; 

Specific prompts:

1) Five times Robo was oblivious, and one time he figured out what someone was implying

2) Robo trying to understand proper human behavior/overanalyzing the way people act around each other/him, etc.

3) All tropes and AUs are accepted here, I know there isn’t very much canon to work with!

Edwin Drood, Helena Landless, John Jasper, Rosa Bud

Favorite pairings with these characters are Helena Landless/Rosa Bud and Edwin Drood/John Jasper, but feel free to write me gen or het. I am really open to anything you want to do with this wonderful unfinished novel. 

Personally, I have trouble thinking without some prompts, so if it's helpful:

Anything with Helena cross-dressing. Especially if the drag is really described in loving detail. Can be a gen fic or a pairing fic with Rosa. She can be dressing as a man for plot purposes or just playing the man for Rosa's pleasure/fun.

&nbsp;

  <a title="
Jasper's opium dreams are about Edwin. Erotic, tender, romantic dreams and/or dark dreams of asphyxiating him with the infamous silk scarf. I love the idea of repetitive, obsessive, tormenting dreams.

I really enjoy the way Jasper fusses over Edwin and the fact that Edwin finds this a bit womanish but likes it. Anything exploring this.">Roll mouse over "link" for popup text. Incest prompts behind cut, no need to view if this may upset you)</a>

David Copperfield - Charles Dickens 
David Copperfield (David Copperfield - Charles Dickens), Uriah Heep (David Copperfield - Charles Dickens)

So, I ship David Copperfield/Uriah Heep. I have written it, but don't feel your take on the pairing has to be mine. I am open to anything and everything with this pairing. I prefer happy endings, but if you want to give this pairing a try but feel happiness is not in the cards, by all means go with your instinct. I am into one-sided pining, as well as exploratory stuff and hate sex, with and without happy endings. I'd be interested in any time during their relationship and any degree of heat and kinkiness. I like epistolary fic and "document" fic. Uriah's awful adolescent poetry, rescued from the grate etc.

I will equally eagerly read gen interactions between David and Uriah so if you don't feel up to this unusual ship, don't worry at all. 

Prompts:

David says at one point: <i>"I really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah or detested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood looking him in the face in the street." </i>   ....so what does David think he might like about him?

I'd be really interested in any kind of moment of kindness or understanding between them, set at any point, during or post-canon.
Bittersweet reconciliation in their old age would be lovely.

A Christmas-related story featuring both characters would very definitely appeal to me (I'm Jewish, but it's Dickens we're talking about)

Anything with Uriah jealously admiring David (his appearance, his goodness, his likability)

An post canon story where Uriah has become enormously rich and prosperous

Any kind of AU you can imagine

For the Term of His Natural Life - Marcus Clarke 
John Rex, Sarah Purfoy

Prompts/thoughts:

In general: John Rex is a no good weasel of a man and that's a fact. I don't mind hearing about this, but I would prefer for fic not to focus heavily on the ways in which his awfulness is physically killing him and making others unhappy.  For example, Sarah could be punishing him (I'd enjoy that) in any number of ways, sexual or non sexual, but I'd like a sense of fun with that.  

If you're not interested in going the pairing route, anything where Sarah shows her resourcefulness would be fun. Something about what she does after the novel ends.

I would LOVE porn for this pairing, anything and everything.

No real squicks or DNWs, but happy endings preferred. AUs of all kinds welcome. In Space seems particularly promising.
&nbsp;
<i>Sarah surveyed him with an expression of contempt. “Because your scheme has failed. Now this is mine. You have deserted me once; you will do so again in any other country. You are a murderer, a villain, and a coward, but you suit me. I save you, but I mean to keep you. I will bring you to Australia, where the first trooper will arrest you at my bidding as an escaped convict. If you don’t like to come, stay behind. I don’t care. I am rich. I have done no wrong. The law cannot touch me—Do you agree? Then tell the man to drive to Silver’s in Cornhill for your outfit.” </i>

HOT, God it's so hot. I feel cheated that John dies at this point. An AU where he lives and we go on from here would be especially amazing.

Duma Key - Stephen King 

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

For Elizabeth, canon gives us quite a lot already, but I'd love more about her art, her sisters and Noveen. Maybe something retrospective as she grows up, or her thoughts when Edgar arrives and she realises Perse's waking up again? She says she's not an artist any more, but has she ever felt the "itch" in the intervening years? Late in the book she tells Edgar, "You will want to, but you mustn't" - did she try to bring Melda back as well? What if it had worked, either as a 'came back wrong' thing or a bittersweet haunting? (An AU where Melda survived would also be very welcome.)

Likewise with Melda, I'd love anything from her POV. What struck me most when I was reading is how young she was when all this happened, and maybe not as able to act freely because of her position in the household, but she's still practical and decisive and instantly willing to believe Elizabeth. Had she heard about people dealing with something similar before, or even had supernatural encounters himself? King does love his childhood closet monsters. Maybe after Edgar has drowned Perse to sleep again, Melda and Elizabeth's ghosts can join forces to save a few of the souls on her ship!

And as for Perse, I just want any kind of exploration of her - her history and origins, her weird affinity with art, her shifting forms. Does she have any goal besides causing chaos? The ship is fascinating: is it a reflection of her, a prison for the people she takes, or even a literal ship that she's trying to crew so she can sail it somewhere? When she offers Edgar power, is that just a desperate lie, or has she had that kind of relationship with other artists in the past? If you're familiar with any of King's other work, it might be fun to try and fit her into his pantheon of evil gods - I feel like she and Rose Madder might be related.

The Entrance - Gerald Durrell 
Gideon de Teildras Villeray

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

I've read this story many times, and I always end up with more questions than answers - I think that's why I keep coming back to it! I love the feeling of mystery and murky things happening in the shadows, never fully revealed to the narrator or the reader. Mostly I'm fascinated by Gideon and I'd love anything from his POV. I could go for something set during his youth in his uncle's house, and all the horrifying occult things that might have happened there. It seems like his uncle is really pushing for Gideon to be a willing participant in whatever's going on, and I'm curious about that.

Later on, his motivations are really obscure. I'd love to see your interpretation of why he approached Peter to begin with, and what his intentions were. Was he really intending to feed him to the monster all along? Could he have been hoping for someone with a knowledge of the occult who could help him? Why do he and the Marquis both target booksellers - is it just that the library already exists as convenient bait, or is there some deeper reason?

This seems like a good moment to mention that I definitely ship Gideon/Peter, so I'd be more than delighted if you wanted to take things in that direction. Maybe Gideon started out with an ulterior motive, but Peter's line about hoping "that he quite genuinely liked me and my company" got me good, and I'd love to read something bittersweet about Gideon struggling with unintended feelings.

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

Looks like the games are going to be split up after this year, so I'll make the most of this while I can! I love Fatal Frame for the sad stories, the settings, and theme of the past and present being intertwined and connected, and also the way it slowly expands the world by bringing in new characters linked to the old ones. Out of the nominated characters I especially like Miu/Yuuri and Hisoka/Yuuri and would not be averse to Miu/Hisoka, but I'm a pretty easygoing multishipper and I also love gen and worldbuilding, so go where your heart tells you!

Some possible prompts:

- Rei helping Hisoka set up her own business and how she feels about Hisoka's interest in antique cameras...
- Hisoka helping Yuuri settle in at the shop after her suicide attempt, and getting used to having a stranger living there with her.
- After Yuuri's "Embrace" ending, Miu and Hisoka grieving for Yuuri and/or visiting her spirit on the mountain.
- After Yuuri's "Bride from Black Water" ending, Miu isn't really expecting Yuuri to come back at all. How does she react when she finds out she's still alive?
- Hisoka and Miu talk about their different experiences growing up with psychic abilities. I could see Hisoka wanting to mentor Miu and heal her a little, though it might be difficult to get over Miu's kneejerk mistrust.
- Miu wants to find out more about other Shadowborn and enlists help from one or all of the others.
- Rei and Yuuri meet and talk about coping mechanisms for when you have a strong emotional bond with the final boss.
- Rei finally gets to meet Miku's daughter! And their conflicted feelings about Miku and her disappearing acts.
- Any kind of time travel or roleswap where the characters end up back in the time of shrine maidens and sacrifices.

Pocket Mirror (Video Game) 

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

When I played this game I was so drawn to Harpae and Lisette and their twisted feelings towards Goldia. I'd love to see anything about that!

- Harpae/Goldia set after the "Blindness" ending. I love dark scenarios where one character imprisons another "for their own good".
- Lisette/Goldia: really anything exploring Lisette's conflicting feelings about Goldia, and her joint murderous/self-destructive impulses.
- Goldia tries to console one of Lisette's injured mirror-selves, even while it's trying to kill her.
- Harpae/Lisette: we know they're aware of each other, and we know Lisette at least can interact with the other personalities to some extent (crucifying Egliette, locking Fleta in the box). I'd love to see what happens if they meet. Maybe they encounter each other while they're waiting for Goldia to arrive?
- More surreal mindscapes, dreamquests and mirrorworlds. Maybe the unlockable "secret room" is not just a game feature. Maybe it's deeper than it looks.
- Look, hair-brushing is a cliche for a reason, okay?
- Something slightly less magical about Goldia post-canon, learning to integrate the different personalities into her concept of herself. There's a scene in the game where Lisette, Harpae and Fleta are sending Goldia glowing messages of hate/encouragement out of the darkness, and I feel like that could be a template for what her interaction with them will be like as she's recovering.
- Fairy-tale AU. Harpae as Goldia's devoted lady knight and Lisette as a banished witch, perhaps?

Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen | Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse 
Asou Misaki, Minazuki Ruka, Tsukimori Madoka

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

This game is A+ for interesting storylines and having a ritual/disaster take place in a more modern setting, but I do wish it had fleshed out the relationships more, especially when it comes to Ruka, Misaki and Madoka. So I turn to fic! I love the contrast of Ruka's poetic spaciness, Madoka's timidity, and Misaki's bossiness, and I'd love to see them interact with each other more. Once again, any combination of characters is fine, it doesn't have to include all three.

- Pre-canon! I could go for something fluffy, like maybe a beach episode, or Misaki and Madoka sneaking into a concert where Ruka is playing. Or something directly relating to canon - Misaki and Ruka researching Rougetsu Island together? Where were they when they heard that Marie and Tomoe were dead? Or maybe they all go ghost-hunting with Misaki's Camera Obscura!
- Missing scenes where Misaki and Ruka react to the fact that Madoka is dead. Just... anything other than the complete stone-faced lack of comment that we get in the game. :(
- Angsty Misaki/Madoka with (forgotten or subconscious) Misaki&gt;Sakuya, exploring that comment Madoka made about Misaki using her as a substitute.
- Less angsty Ruka/Madoka, or maybe something about Madoka listening to the messed-up song Ruka plays. Is there a connection between Madoka and the Tsukimori maidens?
- Threesome.
- GHOST threesome.
- If you really wanted to get into game lore, how about something with Misaki and Ruka exploring their ancestry? It feels like Kunihiko Asou and Souetsu Yomotsuki have some similarities - both wanted to find a way to reach the other world, and both seem to have died in the attempt. How do Misaki and Ruka feel about that, after what they've seen? (A friend of mine had a cool idea about dark!Ruka embracing the mask-making side of her family rather than the Tsukimori side, which appeals to my id in so many ways.)

경성학교: 사라진 소녀들 | The Silenced (2015) 
Hong Yeon-deok | Kazue (The Silenced), Cha Ju-ran | Shizuko (The Silenced)

DNW: Animal harm, pregnancy, OC kids, focus on bodily fluids (blood is okay), mundane/modern AUs.

This film immediately offered three of my favourite things - gorgeous visuals, creepy atmosphere, and f/f subtext - and sealed the deal by including a girl with superpowers wrecking everyone's shit. I'd love to read something shippy with these two, especially if they get a happy ending.

AUs where they both survive:

- Let's pretend Ju-ran wakes up just in time and they escape together! Ju-ran protecting Yeon-deok, fighting off more evil soldiers, huddling for warmth in derelict cottages... all the tropes you might expect from on-the-lam fic.
- Post-canon set a few years down the line, about them learning to live with Ju-ran's powers.
- Or you could go full Stephen King B-movie and have the monstrous results of other science experiments roaming the countryside. My mind is going to werewolves, for some reason...

Or if AUs aren't your jam:

- Something sweet in the afterlife-ish setting from the end of the movie.
- Post-canon fic where they're ghosts, and now the school really is haunted.
- Literally any cute missing scenes you can think of.

Мор. Утопия | Pathologic 
Daniel Dankovskiy, Artemiy Burakh

I ship these two with the fire of a thousand suns, but I'm also utterly fascinated by them in general as characters, so if you're more of a gen writer, that's a-okay by me. I'd prefer no AUs for this fandom as the world of Pathologic is just so dang fascinating in and of itself, though alternate timelines or post-game events are absolutely fine. Hurt/comfort, be it romantic or friendshippy, is great, and so is anything with these two just snarking at each other.

I'm squicked by non-con, mixed generation incest, bestiality, smut featuring underage characters, abuse of authority, and scat, none of which are too likely to show up with this pairing thankfully, but it's worth mentioning.

My weaknesses are hand kink, foot fetish, and necrophilia, though I don't need any of those to enjoy a fic.

Theora/Edison please!  If you can't ship them at least show them working as a team, with Theora guiding Edison past danger and towards a juicy "What I want to know" Edison Carter live exclusive story.  Bonus for hurt/comfort.  You could show them getting together for the first time or working in perfect tandem years after they marry.

Lethal Weapon (TV) 
Martin Riggs (Lethal Weapon (TV))

I've liked actor Clayne Crawford for years and was thrilled to see him get a lead in a major network show.  He infuses Riggs with a wonderful softness and an exquisitely painful depth of grief.  He manages to be a believable tragic figure, suffering the most extreme loss imaginable, yet also his wonderful comic self, bantering with Roger and Trish like a pro comedian with his easy wit.
I'd love to see Martin and Miranda during happier times, Martin finding new love with a canon character like Sarah or his ex-therapist Maureen, or even a future Martin having a baby and finally getting to hold his child in his arms.  I'd even take fix it fic where Miranda never is shot or they both survive and flourish as a family.  Roger and Trish are optional and only as needed to move the story forward.  It's okay to leave all the LA people out of it.  I just want to see Martin experience human emotions, preferably ending with joy.

Stitchers (TV) 

So many wonderful characters - I can't choose just a couple!  I'd enjoy some Kirsten/Cameron where they finally have no more barriers to being truly intimate in all the ways that matter.  I'd love to see Camille and Linus give it another shot because they are awesome together.  I would really like to see fix it fic where Linus's father is never ill or gets out of the hospital fine.  Another dinner with the parents would be lovely, especially if it's with Camille and Linus as a real serious couple this time. I adore Fisher so even some Camille and Fisher friendship fic (boxing training?) would be fun. Future fic is okay as well, like if at some point Kirsten's mother is around and well enough to give her daughter away at her wedding or be there when she has a daughter of her own.  A big family wedding (Kirsteron or Camilnus) would make for a nice happy wrap up in case we don't get any more seasons.

Mushishi 
Ginko (Mushishi)

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Matoba and Ginko bonding over eye-loss. Ginko and the Medicine Seller exploring their mutual techniques in a way that goes poorly for everyone.)

Other than that, I'm just into this for the horror stories. I want Ginko to wander into danger, learn about cool mushi and solve a mystery. Make it as creepy and atmospheric as you can. I love creepy-pasta if you want to do something more modern. 

Types of horror I especially like: creeping unreality, body horror, the uncanny, humans-as-monstrous, psychological horror and isolation.
Types of horror I'm not a fan of: guro/gross-out, slasher

If you want to write pwp, feel free to write Ginko/Adashino or Ginko/mushi with Ginko getting overwhelmed.

I am a fan of haiku, renga, tanka and other Japanese poetry styles. If you too like these things, please feel free to incorporate such things.

Natsume Yuujinchou | Natsume's Book of Friends 
Natsume Takashi, Madara "Nyanko-sensei", Matoba Seiji, Tanuma Kaname

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Nyanko vs The Medicine Seller? Adashino having connections with Taki's grandfather's collection? Natsume's issues with treating ayakashi/yokai as mushi/bugs? The Medicine Seller's methods give Matoba a headache. Tanuma seeking out Ginko or The Medicine Seller to find a way to see yokai and support Natsume more.)

I do ship Natsume and Tanuma, and I would love to have some slow, sweet realizations of their relationship-- possibly with youkai interference, or some mortal danger. I would love both a first date, where they end up having to hide from some youkai, OR Natsume or Tanuma in mortal danger and they discover their mutual feelings over the course of the rescue.

If you want to REALLY indulge me, Natsume and Tanuma both being forced to pretend to dress up as gods (think the Moon-Splitting Festival episode, with Natsume in the Houzukigami kimono and mask) and, you know, have sex in order to keep the forest from dying or something. That or a darker universe where Natsume has given up on humans entirely, and become the head of the Night Parade of 100 Demons or something and then meets Tanuma or Matoba.

I enjoy adventures with demons and the series itself with it's caring and warm atmosphere.

モノノ怪 | Mononoke (Anime & Manga) 

First off: I'm requesting Mushishi, Mononoke and Natsume because I would really love a crossover with one or more of these fandoms. I think they all make a lot of cool, psychedelic sense together.
(Ginko's nonchalance in dealing with the wild confidence of The Medicine Seller. Or bringing the Medicine Seller into Natsume's modern setting and seeing how he adapts or doesn't adapt.)

The things I like best about this series are the theatrical pacing, the hallucinogenic atmosphere-- like, it feels almost like a fever dream with this sense of being unwell and also fascinated. The deep, unfolding psychological horror, and the way the series doesn't flinch from awful events, but shows how they can cause lasting trauma in a twisted, wild way that not controllable.

When it comes to the main character, I think the thing that fascinates me most is his wild confidence. He's so different and he owns his difference so no one ever questions him.

Types of horror I especially like: creeping unreality, body horror, the uncanny, humans-as-monstrous, psychological horror and isolation.
Types of horror I'm not a fan of: guro/gross-out, slasher

Pet Shop of Horrors 
Lau Wu-Fei "Taizu", Count D (Pet Shop of Horrors)

First off: This isn't exactly like the others, in that it's not being requested BECAUSE of the crossover potential. I don't mind a crossover-- I think Pet Shop of Horrors would make an amazing Mononoke episode, and Wu-fei getting caught up in a duel between the Medicine Seller and D, or otherwise dealing with that sort of headache would be great.

BUT, I just ship them, okay.

Maybe this is just my deep and abiding love for organized-crime-types, but I love the idea that Wu-Fei is trying so hard to run this criminal empire and things keep slipping through his fingers because D decided to move in. If you want to go with a coda from the manga, you could do something silly like him eating super-fertility eggs that D accidentally supplied a baker with and getting himself pregnant (I don't normally like mpreg, but I kind of love the idea of Wu-Fei just having to deal with something totally ricockulous because he keeps having to spend time with D). 

Or there's always another assassination attempt, or some other mafia-like plot. But with added ~magic~ craziness because D has a vested interest in keeping Wu-Fei alive.

I desperately ship Archie/Wolfe and would adore shipfic for the two of them, whether that be a first-time fic about how they fell in love/took the next step in their relationship, or an established relationship fic that focuses on a case but turns their flirting/affection up along the way. Wolfe coming to Archie's rescue - particularly when it puts him out/makes him go to trouble he'd never consider otherwise - is my jam, and I also like it the other way around as well. And yes, I would totally read Archie/Wolfe porn!

I'd also love to read about Inspector Cramer, Fritz, and/or Saul's perspective on Wolfe and Archie. I feel like Cramer might have some very interesting thoughts, particularly during a frustrating case, but that there's also a lot of grudging respect there. Do Wolfe &amp; Archie ever have to come to his rescue? Fritz has a front-row seat to the Archie/Wolfe show – does he realize they’re in love before they do? (The cook out-sleuthing the sleuths!) Or matchmake them? Same with Saul.

Motel (Fiddler on the Roof), Tzeitel (Fiddler on the Roof)

<i>Fiddler</i> is probably my favorite musical, and I love all its characters. Motel/Tzeitel are one of my favorite musical couples of all time. How did they fall in love? What were their feelings when they gave each other their pledge, despite the unlikelihood of that pledge being possible to carry out? What were they feeling during the confrontation with Tevye? How did Tzeitel feel seeing Motel stand up to Tevye? What was their first kiss like (and when did it happen)? What was Golde's reaction to Tevye's dream, and did it surprise Tzeitel? What was early married life like for them? What was Tzeitel's relationship with Chava like after Chava's marriage? (Either Motel is much more relaxed than Tevye on the ‘consorting with apostates’ front, or he knows better than to try to forbid Tzeitel to talk to her sister.)

I prefer fic set before/during the musical and immediately after, rather than futurefic set in America.

I love this book! It’s definitely my favorite of the Sally Lockhart series. The setting and the characters are both up my ally. I requested Adelaide because she's the only character I for sure need, but I like all of the other three nominated characters (Jim, Becky, and Karl), so please do include whichever of them you like too.

I ship Adelaide/Jim, Adelaide/Becky, and Jim/Karl, and would be interested in fic for any of those pairings. For this fandom I would prefer plot over porn, however, and friendship fic is also totally my groove if you’re not a shipper. What about an AU where Adelaide was able to stay Queen? (With Jim and/or Becky by her side.) How might she and her country have gone after that? Or how about an outside-POV, from Karl or some other Razkavian (Countess Thalgau would be awesome!), showing events and/or Adelaide from a Razkavian point of view? Or maybe a story about how the events of the novel turn into a national myth/legend (I like stories that have multiple perspectives/versions, including Rashomon-style, and it’d be neat to see that applied here). 

Canon-specific DNWs:
* Please no ‘healing-cock’ or comparison between Adelaide’s past as a sex worker and her experience having sex with Jim or Becky.
* Please no pre-canon fic, especially during Adelaide’s past as a sex worker.
* I’m not interested in characters from the broader Sally Lockhart series making an appearance.

Kronk's Shoulder Devil, Kronk's Shoulder Angel, Kronk (Disney), Yzma (Disney)

This movie is the best. It never fails to make me smile. I asked for four characters and having them all in the same fic would be great, but it’s not required if a prompt takes you a different direction.

Kronk’s shoulder angel &amp; shoulder devil are hilarious. I’d love a story about them. Fights they have! Commentary between themselves while Kronk goes about his everyday life. Banter and flirtation and consummation. Do they ever leave Kronk, and how bereft is he? (How does he get them back?) Where do they go when they’re not on his shoulders? Do they ever end up getting twisted and advising Kronk backwards? Or maybe Kronk finds out that they’re most dangerous when they start agreeing. And how might they become lovers? (And how would Kronk react to that, haha?)

Yzma I don't ship with Kronk, but I'd love to see her perspective on any of the movie events, or a past/future adventure with her. Villain cat! I think she's my favorite Disney villain - she's amazing. Crossover in which she meets a different Disney villain (Ursula? Cruella? Lady Tremaine?) is totally welcome, whether she meets them in human or cat form. And I would totally ship Yzma with another female Disney villain. They could take over the world(s) together!!

I do ship Kronk/Kuzco and would love to see a story in which they fall in love. But friendship fic is totally cool too. Are there future threats to Kuzco's reign (probably from Yzma) that Kronk averts? Do they get turned into animals together? Does Kronk inadvertently (or on purpose) woo Kuzco with baked goods? Etc.

Queens of Crime RPF 
Agatha Christie (Queens of Crime RPF), Dorothy Sayers (Queens of Crime RPF), Margery Allingham (Queens of Crime RPF), Ngaio Marsh (Queens of Crime RPF)

I want the Queens of Crime to meet over lunch/tea and talk about crime writing! What do they think of each other’s heroines? Do they commiserate over the trials/tribulations of being a crime writer – the trickiness of alibis, the obstreperousness of sleuths, the tiring obligation to include romance subplots, the difficulty to find fresh new ways of committing murder, etc.? Do they teasingly point out plot holes/unbelievable elements in each other's books? (Or their own?) Maybe they talk about the novel they’d write, if they didn’t have to worry about selling copies. Or maybe they discuss what they’d do with each other’s sleuths. Or maybe they talk about crossovers – Harriet Vane and Agatha Troy becoming friends (or falling in love!), or Harriet and Ariadne Oliver, or Wimsey and Poirot. 

Basically, a gossipy tea-party with the Queens of Crime talking shop. :)

And if you ship any of them, I am also completely there for Queens of Crime falling in love! Do Agatha and Dorothy flirt with each other and miss the knowing looks Margery and Ngaio are exchanging? Is Margery’s hair askew because Dorothy kissed her when they were fetching the plates of sandwiches from the kitchen? The field is open.

Pet Shop of Horrors 
Leon Orcot, Count D (Pet Shop of Horrors)

Likes: D/Leon in all their weird awkward culture-clashing glory. Leon's journey from "I'm going to arrest you" to "please take care of my baby brother while I'm at work, here's some candy to make up for it, but I'm still going to arrest you." All the surreal and gorgeous imagery in the shop. The vampire subplots. Chris's friendships with the pets, especially Honlon.

Specific prompts:

- What if D really was a vampire? When Leon makes that guess, does D confirm it in the moment, or does Leon find out some other way? Sexy biting scene a must.

- Word has gotten around that Leon is D's chosen mate, so various mythical personages, creatures, former pets, etc. start showing up to evaluate his worthiness and possibly put him through some tests. Naturally, nobody has explained what's going on to Leon.

- Show me some adventures with D adopting out crossover pets. Pokémon, magical Oz critters, Doctor Who/Futurama/Star Wars aliens, whatever. (If you write D into the backstory of Grumpy Cat, I will love you forever.) (Combination prompt with Fake News FPF: if you write "Stephen" as a pet that D adopts out to Jon, or vice versa, I will also love you forever.)

General likes:

Home (2015) 
Oh )Home )2015)), Gratuity 'Tip Tucci (Home (2015))

Likes: Tip-Oh friendship. The way the Boov use random human objects in hilariously incorrect ways. Cool space exploration. Weird alien gender and biology things. Little shoutouts to book continuity.

Specific prompts:

- Futurefic with adult Tip being awesome at some alien-related profession. (Spaceship piloting? Interplanetary diplomat? Chasing down extraterrestrial fugitives?) Bonus points if you can work in a Lilo &amp; Stitch crossover.

- Something silly and entertaining about how the Boov interact with the human LGBTQ community. (I'm picturing Oh getting really worked up about needing different flags for all possible attraction combinations of the Seven Glorious Boov Genders.)

- If you've seen the Netflix show: I unreservedly love DieAnne, so any fic about her would be fantastic. Maybe she, Tip, and Oh have to team up for a mission. Either a serious world-saving one, or a ridiculously mundane one.

Fake News FPF 
Jon Stewart (Fake News FPF), "Stephen Colbert" (Fake News FPF)

Likes: Canon-typical humor. The magical surrealism of the Colbert Report universe. Hurt/comfort where "Stephen" goes through something horrible and Jon is there to support him. Role reversals where "Stephen" has to be the more put-together one in order to protect Jon.

Jon/"Stephen" is one of the OTPs of my heart. You can write pretty much anything with them -- fluffy, angsty, sweet, dysfunctional, canon-based, AU, whatever -- and I'll be thrilled.

Specific prompts:

- Jon/"Stephen" total setting AU. Fantasy, cyberpunk, Greek gods, Steven-Universe-style Gems...what does "Stephen" in this universe have Poorly-Informed But Firm and Unchangeable convictions about? And how does Jon fall in love in spite of himself?

- Something with "Stephen" interacting with Janice From Accounting, the unsung star of Last Week Tonight. It seems like she's the only person who could totally stymie him -- an immovable object to his unstoppable force.

- Sexy fluff with Jon and "Stephen" enjoying their retirement in a cabin in the woods, far away from the news. Kink appreciated. (Canon indicates that "Stephen" is a kinky sub with the safeword "pumpkin patch," who likes bondage, costumes, collars, taking orders, praise, acting like a puppy, and that's just off the top of my head. At this point it should be established enough that they need minimal negotiation to have a good time.)

I love Kazuki and Soushi's fumble toward communication and understanding, how they negotiate identity and relationships under the ridiculous weight of their responsibilities.

Perry Rhodan - Various Authors 
Gaumarol da Bostich | Bostich I. (Perry Rhodan Books)

The Arkonides have been my favourites since the beginning, and I’m particularly interested in Arkonide culture, tensions within the Imperium, and Terran/Arkonide interactions and clashes (different points of view and value systems colliding, military interests ...). Bostich exemplifies all of that, with his journey from unexceptional bureaucrat to puppet Imperator to actually seizing power, and then from expansionist imperialism to grudging cooperation under duress to genuine commitment to the Galaktikum.
Suggestions: Bostich &amp; Atlan, the unseen reconciliation. Bostich &amp; Aktakul, an unexpected friendship. Bostich &amp; Jasmyne, former lovers. Bostich &amp; Tifflor, enemies and allies. Bostich &amp; Bull, what Bostich had done to Bull. Bostich &amp; Rhodan, their deal with the devil. Bostich as leader of the Galaktikum, with many of his former enemies now working for him. Bostich and his own changing views and changing role in the galaxy.
Shipping: Bostich/Jasmyne, Bostich/Aktakul or Bostich/Tifflor
I don’t mind if you’d rather write in German.

Charlotte Holmes Series - Brittany Cavallaro 
August Moriarty

I like the idea of a world where the Holmes, Watson and Moriarty families are huge sprawling messes of expectation and cultural heritage, the way the characters born into those families are forced to navigate those expectations. The Moriartys interest me particularly because we know a lot less about them than the Holmeses or Watsons. August in particular embodies a lot of that struggle, the only one visibly trying to get away from the family business and attempting to escape that “destiny” by acting counter to expectation. 
Suggestions: August &amp; Charlotte and their fraught history. August &amp;  Milo working together, with all their trust issues. August &amp; Leander and that offer at the end of <i>The Last of August</i>. August initially deciding to go into hiding, and what it costs him. August surviving the end of LoA (faking his death?).

Old Surehand (Karl May Verlag) – Karl May 
Tehua | Tahua | Emily Bender | Kolma Puschi

I’ve been a Karl May fan since I was a kid, and Kolma Puschi is one of the most fascinating figures of the books. We meet her as a mystery and a legend, passing as a male warrior, but her backstory is what makes all of that so interesting. A preacher’s sister; a Native woman who married a white man; a falsely convicted forger and prison inmate; a mother searching for her sons; an avenger on the track of her brother’s murderer; a stoic warrior legend – somehow she integrates all of these identities. 
Suggestions: Tehua becoming Kolma Puschi, making a reputation for herself. Her thoughts on her position as a warrior and a woman, and on posing as a man. Using her ability to code-switch to solve a problem. Tehua &amp; Tusahga Saritsch, who knows her real identity. Backstory - Tehua in the East, searching for Etters, or in her youth, meeting a young Winnetou and/or Nscho-tschi. 
No shipping, please, except for Tehua’s marriage to Bender. 
Please don’t use the “Kolma Putschi” spelling for her name, I genuinely dislike it.
I don’t mind if you’d rather write in German.

16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds (Video Game) 
Lucy (16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds)

I would enjoy both light-hearted fun takes on vampire hunting or something dark and frightening and terrible. I came out of this game wanting a billion stories about queer vampire hunting girls, and ship Lucy (the delightful, smart, creative protagonist) with both Maggie (one of the people who hunt vampires with Lucy, best described in the game as: Maggie looks like Tinkerbell. Five feet tall with short blonde hair and a wide smile. The effect is only slightly ruined by the machete and the spray of blood decorating her face and tank top) and Claire (the adorable cashier).

+ character bashing
+ rape, non-con, and dub-con

Down in the Library Basement - sleepyhollow_101 
Cassie (Down in the Library Basement)

I love Cassie and her story so much; she goes from reluctantly helping her mother to being terrified of the thing in the basement, to being protective and smart and loyal. Her mother is also great, and the rest of the librarians who show up in the last part absolutely delightful.

The thing in the basement is giant and spider-like, which means my DNW sort of doesn’t apply here (and also, I have no idea why I love this story so much, because normally I would have noped out of this the second I figured it out). It is also, somehow, a delight.

United States of Asgard - Tessa Gratton 
Soren Bearstar, Glory | Fenris Wolf, Astrid Glyn, Amon Thorson

Dot Hutchison once described the three books in an absolutely perfect way: If Soren’s journey was about accepting himself, and Signy’s about anchoring herself, then Astrid’s journey is about making herself.

I love the world Gratton built. I love the ways the gods are and are not involved with the human world, I love how they can and can’t be trusted, all at the same time, I love the details of how the world has changed because the gods are real and active and what that means for the USA. (One thing I hate is the treatment of the Native American tribes and [lack of] characters; though there are a handful of references to what happened when the Norse gods and their followers came over, mostly they are erased from the narrative, with the exception of Soren’s Pacific Islander ancestry.)

Mostly, though, I love the characters. They are young and strong and weak and fierce, afraid and brave and driven, loved and loving, and, always, hungry to make the world better in whatever way that means to them. I love all of these characters, and would love to see their adventures, together and apart.

You do not need to include all four characters.

Les Misérables (Dallas 2014) 
Javert (Dallas 2014), Jean Valjean (Dallas 2014)

I absolutely love how this production modernizes the show – we might still have the same libretto, but many of the staging choices are so striking and always make me incredibly curious about the world we get to see. What sort of country is this – is it France? Is it the US? Is it contemporary, or is it a dystopian future? How did the different experiences these characters made shape their personalities compared to the 1830s France characters? (For example, a Valjean who spent most of his life in the US prison system instead of the19th century bagne of Toulon!)

What I always find most intriguing about Dallas fic is seeing how a writer makes the characters and the world their own, and comes up with character voices, so whether you want to write a contemporary Texas, a dystopian France, or you find a completely different interpretation of this world, I'm up for all of these things!

Kamen Rider Decade 
Onodera Yuusuke (Kamen Rider Decade), Kadoya Tsukasa (Kamen Rider Decade), Hikari Natsumi (Kamen Rider Decade), Kaitou Daiki (Kamen Rider Decade)

I'd love anything involving these four continuing to bounce around the multiverse.  Feel free to do a crossover with anything--with a later Sentai or Kamen Rider show, to pull in continuity from a movie, to throw them into any other random world (or into other toku worlds--how does the world of Ultraman or Garo handle these four?).  I ship the foursome hard, but I would be happy with anything that just has them continuing to be a strange little family that's sometimes dysfunctional but still works to keep everyone as happy as possible.  Hurt/comfort is great.  Digging into emotions is great.  My only real do not wants are rape or non-con where the focus is on the violation rather than on the healing.

Kamen Rider Kuuga 
Godai Yuusuke, Ichijou Kaoru

I really, really love everyone in Kuuga, but this pair owns my heart.  I ship them, though I also love an asexual Ichijou.  Feel free to pull in any supporting cast members, though--one of the things I adore about Kuuga is how everyone tries to support everyone.  Feel free to set it mid-series or post-series.  I love seeing Godai having alien biology from the Kuuga belt explored.  I love seeing how Godai and Ichijou manage their rather different lives--Ichijou isn't going to give up the cop life until he can't do it, and Godai needs to travel, especially post-series.  Godai taking Ichijou on a vacation is something I love, and feel free to have the location be somewhere crazy.  Hurt/comfort is always good.  Just give me these two being themselves and having different needs but being very supportive of each other and managing to meld their lives anyway, because one of the things they need post the Grongi War is each other.

I adore seeing people come up with alien cultures for the crew and watching them meld and butt against each other.  Marvelous being a brilliant, insane, charismatic leader who protects his crew and understands them better than others expect makes me ecstatic.  Show me the crew chasing another treasure.  Go crazy with a crossover with a later sentai, or with another franchise entirely (a crossover with the Kyurangers would be fascinating).  Explore how holidays are handled on the ship, and what holidays different crew members celebrate.  I really just adore seeing the crew having adventures and supporting each other.

Damaya | Essun | Syenite, Innon (Broken Earth), Alabaster (Broken Earth)

I absolutely adored this threesome and their pirate life.  In a series full of so much pain it was beautiful to see some healing and love, and to have a canonical happy threesome.  I would love either a little snippet set in the time that they were happy (the time so beautifully glossed over in that single sentence at the start of the chapter), or an AU where Innon doesn't die.  Innon and his death had such an impact on both Alabaster and Essun, how would him managing to survive (and how *would* he survive) change things?

I'm fine with something shippy for these two, though it definitely doesn't have to be (and if you do go the shippy route, feel free to play around with alien cultures and expectations of relationships and how they differ between various crew members).  I just want to see Garu supporting and protecting Lucky, and Lucky recognizing how important he is to Garu.  Hurt/comfort is great.  Garu reacting to Lucky almost dying is great.  The two of them trying to navigate a universe that isn't apocalyptic, either in an imagined post-series or because they end up shunted between universes, is great.  I adore the rest of the team, too, so feel free to include anyone you want.

Onmyouji | The Yin-Yang Master (Movies) 
Minamoto no Hiromasa

I'd basically like more of what the movies offered, though perhaps with an explicit Abe no Seimei/Hiromasa pairing.  I love the period setting, the magic and mystery.  I love anything that plays with Seimei being half-kitsune and what that gives him/how that's impacted his life beyond him being a damn strong onmyouji.  I love seeing Hiromasa being his wonderful self, not wanting to see anyone hurt, while still being very much a product of his time period.  I really like the idea of the two of them in a relationship, and given the period it would probably be an It's Complicated relationship with Hiromasa still courting ladies of the court (unless Seimei would have objections).  Another threat to the capital/the nation being defeated; the aftermath of their next battle as protectors; the two of them just having tea and it getting weird because Seimei's life and household is weird; basically anything with these two would be great.  Hurt/comfort is always beautiful (the moment in the first movie when Seimei thinks Hiromasa is gone forever; the moment in the second when Hiromasa is watching over a comatose Seimei).

Fantasy Life (Video Game) 
Player Character (Fantasy Life), Damien Helbourne | Daemon Helbourne, Odin (Fantasy Life), Grace (Fantasy Life)

For all fandoms: All ratings okay, slash/femslash/het/gen/poly fine. No noncon, sexual kinks related to bodily fluids, humiliation for the sake of humiliation. Incest, dubcon, worldbuilding (non-explicit) A/B/O and crossovers okay, but see letter for details. Please avoid people dying from terminal diseases except for one fandom. Likes: Fluff (family/friend/team bonding), hurt/comfort. 

For the nominated characters, I'm open to pairing the Player Character with Damien or Grace, and Damien with Grace. Conflicted one-sided Odin/Player Character is fine as well. For non-nominated characters, I tend to ship the Player Character with Yuelia and Zippy with Chic (we know that Chic wouldn't mind dating Zippy, after all), so if you want to put those in as background pairings, that's fine. I headcanon my (female) Player Character as bisexual or asexual/biromantic (or asexual polyromantic), but I am not you; you feel free to do what you want romance-wise!

Note that not all characters have to appear in the fic.

Prompts:
* There's a whole lot of worldbuilding that I'd to see, but here are some ideas:
- What is the scientific community like? Does it have any intersection with the Alchemist Life?
- Is there a library that we don't see in Porto Puerto? How about some discussion between the library branches? (It's fine to include Origin Island in this as well.)
* Damien and Grace - I know that neither Damien nor Grace are really keen on marriage to each other, but what if they don't really have a choice?
* Ditto for Damien and the Player Character - I've written this before but it would be cool to see what would happen if the Player Character turns out to be a viable choice (much to Demona's dismay, and probably the Player Character's). This also would be part worldbuilding because all we know about the qualifications for Damien's bride is from Demona's questioning of Grace in the DLC.
* Damien and Odin discuss things after his Trial, given what happened during it.

ファイナルファンタジーＸＩＶ 光のお父さん | Final Fantasy XIV: Dad of Light 
Shoda Yoko, Inaba Hirotaro, Inaba Aiko

Shipping-wise, I do ship Aiko/Yoko, even if Aiko is a tad oblivious.  I also have not played Final Fantasy XIV (my MMO of choice is Guild Wars 2), but feel free to include game details if you do play it.

As with all my fandoms, not all characters have to appear in the fic.

Prompts:
* Hirotaro learning to MMO. We see some of it (mostly when Aiko is trying to help his father), but I'd like to see Hirotaro learn the game.
* Perhaps a little more of the flashback where young Aiko is teaching his father how to play Final Fantasy III. (I thought it was the original Final Fantasy, but apparently it's an early III.)
* Aiko finally realizing that Yoko wants to go on a date.
* Yoko agonizing about quitting and the uniform issue.

Kamen Rider Drive 
Shijima Kiriko, Saijou Kyuu

I ship Kiriko/Chase, but I don't think that this really comes up in my prompts and I don't mind Chase being a younger "brother" of sorts to the Shijima siblings. (Speaking of siblings, I'm not really fond of Gou but I'm okay as long as he's not the focus character.)

Prompts:
* What would it have been like if Kiriko became Drive? What would have changed?
* Kiriko bonds with her Special Investigation Unit coworkers.
* Maybe-happier AU where Kiriko suddenly has 108 (or 109) "younger" robot siblings.
* Kyuu and 072, a happier ending.
* Kyuu goes to a convention, possibly in the U.S. Possibly he's a Guest of Honor!
* That scene where Kyuu and 072 become friends - I'd love to see an expanded version of it.

Kamen Rider Ex-Aid 
Houjou Emu, Poppy Pipopapo, Parad (Kamen Rider Ex-Aid)

Shipping: I ship Emu/Parad. 

Exception to the DNWs: I'm actually okay with a terminal Game Illness (at least with the person becoming a Bugster).

Prompts:
* I'm really interested in Parad's relationship with Emu post-series, either romantically or as a brotherly relationship.
* Poppy tries to take care of Emu when he's down.
* Parad and/or Poppy get Dan Kuroto to design yet another Gashat - what would be the likely outcome? (Another Survival Horror like Fatal Frame, perhaps? A visual novel like one of the Zero Escape games? Or maybe a MMO like Guild Wars 2 or Glitch....)

Rune Factory 4 
Frey (Rune Factory), Vishnal (Rune Factory), Ventuswill (Rune Factory), Blossom (Rune Factory)

I ship the crackship of Frey/Blossom (and I wouldn't mind Frey/Dolce), but in-game I usually end up romancing Vishnal, Kiel, or Leon. (I also adore Dylas and Doug's very interesting friendship.)

Prompts:
* Ventuswill worries about Frey, and tries to provide some comfort to her.
* The Dragon and the Princess: The Great Prank War.
* Frey might not truly be a princess, but to Vishnal, that's always what she will be to him.
* Frey tries to romance an oblivious (or not so oblivious) Blossom. This could involve time travel. And a very confused Ventuswill.
* Vishnal finds himself in friendly competition with Blossom.

Stardew Valley (Video Game) 
Female Player (Stardew Valley), Penny (Stardew Valley), Maru (Stardew Valley)

I like Stardew Valley because you can focus on what you want - whether it's to explore the mines, work on your relationships, tend your farm, or anything else. I tend to be a miner myself, but I see all the pretty farms and I'm jealous. Being able to romance or just befriend a lot of people is great, and I enjoy the challenge of not letting the relationships decay too much (or at least until I reach the point where I no longer have to do it). I love everybody in Pelican Town (I've even gotten used to Pam and Jasmine) and part of what I focus on is making the town better for everyone.

Note: I specified (cis)female farmer because that's what I play, but I'm fine with a genderqueer/agender farmer or a transgender one. I usually romance Maru, but I'm also fine with Shane, Haley, or Abagail if you prefer.

Prompts:
* The farmer and Penny - discussing educational methods, books, and family on a cold winter day.
* MarILDA comes back for a visit.
* Penny and Maru end up romancing each other, and the farmer has an idea - why don't they move onto the farm, and the farmer will move in with Maru's family.
* Taking care of one of the specialty farms - how does the farmer go about it?
* Maru and her parents have a talk after the farmer starts romancing Maru.

I love the mood of the album and the videos - the freedom hunting and self-indulgent thrill-seeking, the rebellion against how the world works, finding a new kind of home and way of living, the whole extremely nonsensical dystopia with tight-knit gangs of misfits in fab outfits racing away from really weird police on fancy vehicles as they wail about saving each other: HELL YEAH.

Thirsty - M. T. Anderson 
Chris (Thirsty)

Asking for a happy ending to get wrangled out of this book feels like rather a betrayal of its spirit, but, just, poor Chris! He was not equipped to deal with the kind of decisions he got saddled with. If this goes really dark before it gets better, that's fine - maybe he just can't quell that vampiric thirst anymore, even before he gets out of his house or neighbourhood - but I would really would love a happier ending for him. Maybe some other power can get use out of a proto-vampire on the cusp of sealing the deal, and offers him self-control in exchange for blood. Maybe some other, more terrifying angels can help after all.

I'd also love anything more about the details of this urban fantasy life he loves, even if it doesn't touch on the main plot of the book - the portrayal was really interesting. That one story mentioned where a woman put her babies in the fire on the suspicion that there was a changeling - but only one turned out to be a changeling, and the other one was a normal human - still sticks in my mind. Maybe something about other changelings? Or about how the supernatural elements work in other countries - how bound they are to localities, or if they grow markedly different if they manage to travel.

It was darkly humorous how the book played up the standard changes of growing up into something epic, life-and-death, due to the interplay of normal life and the supernatural. More of that would be great, like the changes of puberty alongside monstrous bodily changes, or something with an older Chris struggling with a supernatural debt as his peers struggle with college debt.

Or they could run into more difficulties making people believe what was happening.

Like Real People Do - Hozier (Song) 
Honey (Like Real People Do), Narrator (Like Real People Do)

Sweet &amp; creepy is one of my fave atmospheres, so bringing that aspect of the song out in fic form would be wonderful. I want anything on Revenant Would-Be Lover, putting thoughts and memories and something like a life back together, and their tentative but persistent affection for Honey. Honey doesn't have to have romantic feelings for them, but I'd prefer Revenant to stay more on the sweet side and less on the creepy in the case of unrequited love.

Any genders are OK. And uh, you don't have to call the narrator "Revenant" or the other person "Honey", I'm doing that for convenience. The Barn on the Farm version of the song has ruined me slightly and has got me tending to imagine this story playing out in a rural setting. If there's any sex, please make Revenant not be a grody type zombie with bits falling off, though unsettling physiology is okay. For both of them, even, depending on what you decide to do with Honey.

I wound up writing Pop Girl last year which made me like her a little more, actually. So I wonder what would happen if Cassie and Nick run across her again. I'm not a huge Kira fan, because she seemed too apathetic and empty in the movie, but if she shows up in the story I hope you can sell her to me. I wanted to like her, I just kinda... didn't.

Monster High 
Draculaura (Monster High)

Draculaura has always been my favorite character in Monster High - both old and new versions.  Her sweet, kind nature appeals to me.  I'm really loving the reboot Draculaura, and would love to see something with her and her father, either from before they met Frankie in new continuity, or trying to find time for family bonding while dealing with the growing pressures of running a school and finding new students.  Any other characters added to the mix would be fine, but family bonding is what I want above all else - Fangelica and Elissabat count as family for these purposes.

It would also be cool to see an older Elizabeth cross over with the 2013 series somehow - crossing paths with Jedikiah post that series or helping Stephen's group somehow.

I think a post-series encounter would be especially interesting, given John's mental state at the end of the series.

New Mutants

Illyana's story is so tragic and layered, and I love her to death.  Anything Illyana-centric would be awesome.  With her character being what it is, darkfic would be appropriate (though nothing super-gory or non-con).  Illyana was also kind of flirty in her New Mutants days, so her deciding to mess with her teammates or the Hellions with wicked flirting would be cool, but nothing further than kissing - she's, what, fourteen or fifteen-ish?  Marvel time is weird.
Illyana wrestling with her Darkchilde self, talking with her teammates about deep philosophical issues, pranking people, teasing her brother, dealing with the aftermath of Fall of the Mutants, you name it.  Anything pre-Inferno would be sweet.  I love the varied relationships she has with everyone, especially Dani, Rahne, and Doug.  And Illyana and Kitty are the best of friends (with subtext?)  Ooh, crushes - requited or otherwise, would be cool too.  I've always seen her as pansexual, so crushes/flirting with anyone would work for me.
Really, if she sounds like Illyana and acts like Illyana as Claremont &amp; Simonson wrote her, it will make me super happy

New Dangan Ronpa V3: Everyone's New Semester of Killing

Do not wants: Permanent death of requested characters, pregnancy, harm to animals, modern/mundane AU, sad ending

&nbsp;

Even though I have 'mundane AU' in my DNWs, setting the story in the Hope's Peak bonus mode is fine!

Please note that it's not necessary to include all four characters! I just like all four so much, that I couldn't chose! Out of this group, I ship Amami/Kaede, Amami/Kaede/Saihara, and Ouma/Saihara! I'd prefer not to receive Saihara/Kaede unless it's part of poly with Amami. I'd also prefer no Ouma/Amami, unless there's end-game Oumasai (I do feel as if Ouma was kind of into Amami too, even if Oumasai is my main Ouma ship!).

Prompts for all characters:
-Fix-its!
-Something set pre-canon. Amami and Kaede or Saihara and Ouma having known each other pre-killing game would be great to play with
-AU with different survivors at the end (I'd love to see Amami using his SHSL Survivor talents in the outside world post-game, especially)
-SDR2 AU, where instead of Saishuu, the v3 kids find themselves on Jabberwock Island
-Future Arc AU. What would everyone's NG Codes be? (I *loved* the NG Codes aspect)
-Anything involving the Love Hotel, even if you feel like it's been done before. I am Weak and easy to please.

Ouma/Saihara-
-Persona 5 AU
-Saihara seeing through a lie
-Ouma telling a lie to protect Saihara from something
-Either of them remembers their life pre-canon, where they knew each other. How would this change things?
-AU where Ouma lives. I'd love to see the two rebuilding together.

Amami/Kaede(/Saihara)-
-Amami winds up with the love hotel key and visits Kaede's fantasy, or intrudes on her fantasy while Saihara is already there?
-AU where Kaede remains the protag (if you need to chose a different first victim and killer, any character I haven't requested is fine!)
-Kaede's super hearing allowing her to hear odd sounds coming from Amami's room. What could he be doing in there~?
-Piano sex

It's not necessary to use all four characters! I just enjoy them all equally and couldn't pick between them! As for ships, I love Berkut/Rinea, and Forsyth/Python! I'm not big on Alm/Celica, though, so I prefer mentions of it kept brief.

Prompts for all:
-Magical mishap/spell gone wrong (feel free to go either funny and fluffy, or darker here)
-Battlefield injury, with hurt/comfort after
-'Magic made them do it'

Python/Forsyth
-Overnight supply run
-Battlefield injury, with possible hurt/comfort after
-Python comes off as kind of depressed to me, rather than just simply lazy. I’d love to see exploration of that.

Berkut/Rinea
-Berkut’s feelings about Rinea. I feel that despite what transpired, he really did love her. I’d love to see more on his feelings.
-The same for Rinea! What are her feelings on her lord? She loves him, of course, but she must feel conflicted as well, given some (most) of his behavior.
-AU where the both of them team up with Alm, or even maybe Celica?
-Fix-it! I live for post-canon fix-its.

Once again, I chose multiple characters because I love them all equally! That said, no need to include all three boys unless you want to! My ships are Watson/Friday, Watson/Nikolai, or Watson/Nikolai/Friday.

-Watson revives both Friday and Nikolai. What happens next?
-A Nikolai-centric fix-it
-A missing scene between any of these boys during their journey (as much as I love living!Friday, zombie!Friday was adorable)
-More steampunk world-building
-Friday and/or Nikolai is brought back, but has difficulties with feeling 'human enough'/struggles with zombie urges, etc

please also don't feel obliged to include all of the characters listed, or be limited to them. i'm mostly looking for character studies or relationship studies of those 3 characters in particular.

Southland 
Ben Sherman, John Cooper (Southland)

Anything with these two hooking up would make me so happy.

Would like it if things start out very spiky and conflictual and then resolve into a happy ending. Lengthy tormented pining on either side is also great. Porn is great but not compulsory.

If you are not feeling the romance/sex aspect (or if you just like case fic), case fic would also be cool.

Would prefer the issues/complexities with professional boundaries and power imbalance to be part of the story rather than handwaved away- the conflict and taboo around this are very hot/tasty to me! 

No character death please, cannot cope with the series ending AT ALL (in fact a fixit would be great).

The Night Manager (TV) 
Jonathan Pine, Lance "Corky" Corkoran, Richard Roper

There is a high stakes, intricate psychological chess game going on between these three during the events of canon, and I would love it if the implicit sexual tension in it became more overt.

For instance...
Does Jonathan try to seduce Corky to get him on side? This could be: he just ambiguously flirts with him, or he actually bangs him. BONUS excitement if Jonathan has never banged a man before and doesn't think he'll like it, but then does. The spectre of Roper looms over it all - they continue to manoeuvre to gain his confidence. I'm not sure if Roper should know they're hooking up - whatever gives the best conflict!

OR: have Roper and Corky always hooked up casually on the downlow? Now Roper makes it known he expects Jonathan to join this arrangement as a show of trust (or just because he believes J will be into it). Jonathan feels he must comply to keep them on side.

These ideas are pretty dubcon-ish because I am really into the danger and ambiguity here, but if that is not your comfort zone, things could all remain on the level of the psychological rather than physical.

Ok to not use all listed characters, if you like.

The Americans (TV 2013) 
Philip Jennings, Stan Beeman

Would love something exploring Philip's ambivalence/guilt/anxiety about being Stan's friend and also his covert enemy. Could be slash or gen.

A case fic where he has to run an extended op on Stan, and possibly seduce him, would be particularly awesome.
