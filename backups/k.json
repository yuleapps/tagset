It wasn't perfect but I love the sense of place we get about Possum Springs, and how like a real place it feels, with its long history -- from the Andrew Carnegie expy and the coal mining days right down to the recently-abandoned Food Donkey and the details of the flood years ago. I also love the... autumnalness of the game? and how it encomasses homecoming and harvest and fun spooky stories but also death and sacrifice and a literal fall. And I knew a lot of Maes, Beas, Greggs, and Anguses in my awkward stumble through my early twenties. (I've been them too.) It just felt incredibly true to life for a game that's about talking animals and a cult, set in the kind of town I definitely didn't grow up in.\n\nThat said, I was left wanting to know more... so here I am asking for fanfic of it. I really really want to know what happens next, I guess? \"Next\" is flexible -- what happens within the next weeks or months; what happens in two years? Five? Ten? Does anyone like... notice all the people who are suddenly missing from the town who presumably died horribly in an abandoned mine? Does Mae go back to college or does she opt to do something else, assuming she's able to get her life back together? Do Gregg and Angus live happily ever after? Does Bea ever get like... anything resembling happiness?\n\n(I hope so.  She's been through some shit.)\n\nSo okay, that's a lot of questions, although I'm not sure they constitute prompts.  I'd really like something exploring the worldbuilding of the 'verse and how (whether?) Mae's dreams and visions tie into that.  (My general preference is that this is somewhat related to her mental health issues but that it isn't just all in her head.  But I like ambiguity too.)  I'd also just plain like to see her happy, maybe going back to school but maybe finding something in town to do.\n\nI don't really have my heart set on specific ships and am 100% fine with gen focused on worldbuilding or adventure or a specific friendship, but I think my favorite Mae ship is Mae/Lori, weirdly enough?  The Lori M segments were my favorite parts outside of the Gregg and Bea outings, and I'd also totally be happy with them as platonic friends but I think it would be cute for Lori to have a kind of kid crush on Mae that develops into a real thing once she's older.  I also slightly shipped Mae/Selmers in the game (because of <i>course</i> I listened to all the poems) and I'd be curious to see what would happen if Mae ran into the Bombshell again.  (Would bad decisions ensue or could she be honest and also not weird?)\n\nI'd also love fics concentrating on Mae's friendship with Bea, Gregg, Lori, Selmers, Germ, and... really probably anyone else in the cast she was friendly with, including the weird janitor.  I'd also love to see a fic about young Mae and her grandfather.\n\nAlso, just throwing it out there -- if you wanna totally ditch Mae (much as I love her) and write me fic about <i>what the actual fuck</i> happened to the Deep Hollow Hollerers, that'd be AWESOME.\n\n<b>General DNWs:</b> Explicit/intense non-canonical child abuse; characters under 15 in consensual sexual situations and under 18 in nonconsensual ones; stories about how family is always 100% awesome; incest; painplay; humiliation; M/f; anal; lengthy kink negotiation.\n\n<b>Specific DNWs:</b> Mae/Bea as a romantic pairing.\n\nLetter: http://kaesa.dreamwidth.org/37569.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Kaesa","fandom": "Hiveswap ","characters": "Joey Claire (Hiveswap)","prompt": "There are more details about my general likes/dislikes and my interest in crossovers and AUs in my letter!\n\nHiveswap was incredibly charming and '90s-nostalgic for me, and I also really love fish out of water stories, so while I fell in love with Joey as she ran away from the monsters, watching her get to Alternia and explore this weird troll planet's weird troll culture was <i>a delight.</i>  So I'd really really like to see more of her on Alternia.  Feel free not to worry about what timeline this is even set in Homestuck-wise, or the implied time limit before the portal opens and she can go back to earth -- I'm totally fine with fic that sends her back home at the end but if you also want to write her staying on Alternia and becoming some kind of alien rebel leader (who is also a ballerina veterinarian) who takes down the empire, feel free!

Anyway!\n\nThe things I loved most about the books, in no particular order: all the descriptions of tea; Breq's collection of songs and her anthropological interest in them and their lyrics and their misinterpretations (oh tree! where's my ass?); loving descriptions of outfits including gloves and/or scandalous lack thereof (I like handporn, so sue me); a narrative that really vividly depicts both the appealing and appalling aspects of empire and colonialism (\"luxury always comes at someone else's expense\"); Breq's heroism and sarcasm and her moral code and her insistence on trying to do the right thing; the thought that goes into the worldbuilding, in particular that the various planets don't generally have one uniform culture but many that interact in complicated ways with each other; the interesting interplay of Breq's multiple selves and the general evolution of her sense of self throughout her history as a ship and as a separate entity.\n\nAnyway, I would love you to do something with any of the above!  Hopefully it was at least somewhat coherent.\n\nMy ships (such as they are) include onesided Justice of Toren/Lieutenant Awn; Seivarden/Breq; and Breq/Mercy of Kalr, so I'd be really pleased if you concentrated on any one of those relationships, whether or not you wanted to make them explicitly romantic or sexual.  The thing that appeals to me most is the bond of loyalty between these particular characters, and so if you bring that out (either by testing their loyalty or reaffiriming it) I will probably be happy!  Maybe show me how Lt. Awn ended up becoming one of Justice of Toren's favorites, or some hurt/comfort between Seivarden, Breq, and/or Mercy of Kalr.

I really found myself craving more awkward eco-assassin shenanigans.  Chris in general is a lot of fun; I love how they don't seem to see an actual ethical issue with, you know, murdering oil execs with a crossbow, and their enthusiasm for their cause, and their general awkwardness around all things interpersonal.  (I was actually an environmental studies major in college and so a lot of the things they get excited about are things my peers and I spent a lot of time discussing the ethics of.

She seems to know it, but it's concealed from the player, and that really intrigues me.  I'm also curious about the game being an experimental treatment for soul-sickness -- is the player character a patient somewhere, in a world where soul-sickness is a thing?  And the Scythian seems to think of the player as an all-knowing god guiding her along, so I'm super curious whether she's been hearing something guiding her along for a while now.  How real is this whole setting?  What if the Scythian was to realize her god was <i>not</i> all-knowing?  What if the Player refused to complete the woeful errand and found a way to save the Scythian?

I'd prefer a story set in the show's universe rather than the real world - as in, a story set in the world in which Jane really is a mad scientist, time travel is real, Luke has an evil twin, and James the camera man really was turned into a sheep, rather than a story about a really talented bunch of YouTubers with fertile imaginations. That said, I don't necessarily want a lot of fantastic or supernatural elements or an adventure story; I'd prefer something that focuses on the relationships and interactions in their fictional everyday lives. With only incidental explosions. Much like the show itself, in fact!\n\nPlease do include romance and sex, if that's your cup of tea. My personal headcanon is that Mike, Jane and Andy are all in a complicated and delightful relationship together, but I am happy with any pairing that does not exclude any of the other characters. I would be happy to see Luke and Ellen included in the story, but I don't particularly ship them with anyone (except with themselves as platonic life partners), so I would prefer it if you do not include them in any ships with the characters I did request. \n\nExplicit sex is very welcome, but I would prefer if it were not the focus of the story.

To my mind, Doc and Marty are drawn together despite their difference in ages, and that difference changing would not change the relationship. (As indeed shown when Marty meets 1955!Emmet.) \n\nI do, however, like how meeting Emmet makes Marty see his friend from another point of view.

I'm a sucker for first-time stories, so if you do want to slash them, I would very much enjoy a story in which Marty realizes he's in love with Doc through meeting Young Emmet.

Not crazy about cross-overs unless otherwise noted.\nPlease no A/B/O/Omegaverse/knotting or associated aspects, tropes etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI loved this show so much for its great writing and not to mention all the supporting characters who could scare you to death, piss you off, or break your heart in any given scene, due to the writing and acting.\n\nMy special passion however is the Ho-yay/Foe-yay between Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder.  While I believe Boyd truly falls in love with Ava, I also think that he and Raylan have something deep and lasting between them, no matter how many times they try kill or incarcerate each other.  I know it’s the biggest cliché in the fandom, but there’s just no way that “We dug coal together,” doesn’t mean something deeper.\n\nWhile I’d love to see some fairly hard-core slash for these two, I’d also be good with some UST, or just obsession on the part of one or the other.  It could be something back in the “dug coal” days or a missing scene from some point in the cannon.  If you don’t go for the actual sex, I’d be happy with a fantasy masturbation scene on the part of either character, or even something from Ava or any other character’s point of view, who finds their relationship titillating. Extra bonus love for any way you might find to get Wynn Duffy in there as a participant, fantasist, or observer because there’s no snark like Wynn Duffy snark.\n\nAnything that slots into missing space within canon makes me happy, as does a possible post-series fic.  I’m not particularly a fan of schmoop, but something that shows Raylan to have genuine feelings toward Boyd would be appreciated, especially post series.  I KNOW he was manipulating Boyd in the last scene, but I also believe/feel/need/want him to FEEL something for this man he’s known so long and FAILED to kill on many occasions when he could have.  Perhaps, against all odds, Boyd gets paroled and Raylon decides to intercept him long enough to give Ava a head start and the best or only way is to play the “We dug coal” card and things HAPPEN…and Raylan likes it happening more than he wants to admit.\n\nIn general I tend to sympathize with Boyd over Raylan far more than any right-thinking person should. Walton Goggins slow-burn sexiness tends to make me forget that he's supposed to be the baddie. Also the fact that almost every season had a baddie who was so much baddier and less appealing. So if there's anyway that Boyd \"wins\" in whatever the scenario is, I'd be thrilled, although I understand this might not be realistic or fit in with canon, so I leave that to your discretion.

I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side. No Yuri/Estienne in particular please!\n\nWarchild is my absolute favourite series of books and I love that it's getting more fic now (in Yuletide season anyway)! :) I love that the books are all narrated by different characters because then we get to see them all interacting with eachother with new eyes (my favourite parts of Burndive are Jos and Ryan's interactions for instance; Jos is so quiet but broody in Warchild, so having a character see him without the context of his thoughts was extremely interesting to me). I like that the POVs are from very different sides of the war even though they all end up in one place in the end. I love Macedon and its crew. I reread these book at least once a year and always find something new to enjoy!\n\nThis is your explicit permission to not have to write about all three of the characters that I've requested, write about just one or two if you'd prefer (the prompts also don't necessarily include all 3 characters).\n\nPrompts:\n\n-Anything set post-Cagebird getting to see the characters interacting on Macedon. I'm particularly interested in Yuri's interactions with Jos (both being former proteges but extremely different) and Ryan (is it friendly? is it bitter? What's going on there?) but frankly any of the rest of the crew interacting with Yuri would make me extremely happy too. I'd also love to see Yuri's reaction to finding out who actually killed Falcone...! Basically, anything about Yuri on Macedon would make me grin away!\n\n-Wasn't the plan to potentially eventually let Yuri reunite with surviving members of his family (even if it has to be under guard)? Would be quite interested in seeing that explored given that Yuri has changed massively since his childhood; he doesn't even really use the same name any more. Could be a good way to do a sort of outsider POV character study of Yuri. (I love my character studies, haha.) Bonus points if Jos is in the guard accompanying him.\n\n-Anything about Jos and Ryan's less antagonistic relationship by the end of Burndive would be welcome, too. Doesn't matter in what capacity. Actually, the scene where Jos brought Ryan aboard Turundrlar was quite interesting, so might be interesting seeing Ryan have to take more steps into that world of striviirc-na and start having to work through his prejudice. That has to start somewhere, and he seems to generally be forgiving Jos for being a symp at that point.\n\n-On one of my later rereads of Warchild, I found myself wondering whether the brigs had optics or not. They probably do. I would actually be quite curious to see Ryan somehow get ahold of that archive footage and seeing some of the times Jos got stuck in brig (or Yuri, they're the big two really who we know spent a bunch of time in brig... Evan's the only other person we really know who ended up in there). It mostly occurred to me because Azarcon lets Ryan get away with quite a bit that he wouldn't let his recruits do, so that in itself could be an interesting lens on Azarcon's more ruthless leadership style as well as some insight into Jos or Yuri. (He could definitely have used more insight into Jos during Burndive, haha.)\n\n-Would also be quite happy to see some of Jos' experiences as a known symp and former spy on board Macedon, because we don't see too much of his point of view during that time frame in Warchild, then of course we take Ryan's POV in Burndive... People certainly aren't subtle about it!\n\n-An AU of sorts where Ryan wasn't shot at and so didn't end up on Macedon/start learning more about the war. How would that work? Would the later events still happen and Macedon still go rogue (since that was ultimately over shutting the station down to rescue Ryan)? He has tended to believe everything the Send has said about aliens at this point, so what's he going to make of his father trying to instate the peace process when he very firmly doesn't believe in and is ultimately untouched by the war except for his traumatising experience down on Earth? And where does Yuri come into it in this timeframe?\n\n-Ryan is a bit suspicious of the way Azarcon treats Jos a few times in Burndive (even comments that Jos looks like him!), so would love to see fic where Ryan wonders if Jos is actually a sibling of his from some sort of intergalactic affair! I've always wondered this... especially since Azarcon even invites Jos to that family (plus Sid!) meal, haha.\n\nIf you want to include other characters (in the tag set or not) I'm happy with that, everyone needs more love.\n\nIf none of this sounds interesting, go your own way with one or more of the requested characters and I'll be very happy. :)\n\nI'm not up to date on the Patreon stuff, but I don't mind if you include references.\n\n\n"},{"username": "KiaraSayre","fandom": "The Middleman (TV) ","characters": "Wendy Watson, The Middleman","prompt": "I love absolutely everything about this show, and while I don't ship Wendy and the Middleman, I love the relationship between them.

Although I requested all four characters I would be happy with fic for either of those two pairs.\n\nChihaya &amp; Sudou: I was kind of into this as a crack pairing before when their main interactions were Sudou occasionally sadistically taunting Chihaya, but lately they've actually been hanging out and training together and I'm so into it! Chihaya is my favorite character in the series and I love everything about her. She's so earnest and passionate and kinda dumb and just the perfect sports manga protagonist, haha. I always enjoyed Sudou and his sadism from early on as well but it feels like he's become more of a fleshed-out character lately. I've really enjoyed all the scenes of them training together and how Chihaya no longer just takes Sudou's shit but dishes it out as well. They have some of my favorite banter between any two characters, and I liked how they had an increased awareness of each other and some silent communication going on in the match in recent chapters. I could dig this as either a kind of \"bros\" dynamic, or UST or porn would also be great.\n\nTaichi &amp; Suou: Their relationship has been in development for a bit longer. I absolutely flipped my shit when Taichi started his whole thing with imitating the way that Suou does everything. I have long loved Taichi and his warring impulses to be good/polite/etc and that underlying pettiness and competitive drive. With Suou, I especially dig those moments where he gets kind of silly (like considering any girl who talks to him a potential \"bride\"). I REALLY love both of their karuta playing styles. I also dig this as porn, or the two of them having more interactions like in canon, especialy if Suou takes digs at Taichi for trying to be things he's not. (And I love it when Taichi tries to be super cool and emotionless and then ends up embarrassed/flustered about something.)\n\nSome ideas: training regimens, karuta matches, odd couples, banter, arguments, UST, roleplaying, dares, embarrassment, stubbornness, casual sex, friendship, confused feelings\n\nOr prompts:\n-Okay, the current plot arc (ch186 as of the scanlations) is KILLING me with all the Chihaya, Sudou, and Taichi drama. And even though Suou isn't physically there he's present through Taichi as well as Sudou's desire to beat him. This may all be resolved by the time fics go live but I'd love a fic exploring more of this kinda stuff.\n-Further scenes from Chihaya &amp; Sudou training together, especially if it leads into some UST (or resolved). Ditto for Taichi and Suou.\n-Taichi trying to do everything the way Suou does it has to include how he jerks off\n-Futurefic of Sudou and Chihaya after she's graduated high school.

I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side.\n\nI got really emotionally invested in this series, and was sad (but not really surprised) that is has no fic. There were certainly lots of things I wanted to read about when I’d finished the series!\n\nSince I’m requesting any, here are some prompts:\n\n-Fix it fic for book 3? It’s rare that I want fix it fic, but seriously, can there be a miraculous rescue at the end or something? Or Jack and Enim manage to break out. Or Enim can somehow get in touch with Karl. Everything has gone so wrong by the end, and just changing a few things might make things a bit happier! Speaking of fix it fic, you could split earlier and avoid the whole Karl and Enim not being on speaking terms thing (-that’s- the one unforgiveable thing Enim did? They actually seemed to be getting on okay too, so it’s startling; I could totally imagine book 1 Karl and Enim agreeing to never speak again). \n\n-This series is rather fixated on Enim’s viewpoint, but I’d be very curious what he looks like from the outside, as well as other things going on in other characters lives. I’d like to see Jack’s view of that year (even if his sights are firmly fixated on Miss Mercier rather than his dormmate). I’m very interested in the schizophrenia storyline and anything involving that would make me happy.\n\n-Speaking of point of view fic, I’d like to see Karl and Beringer’s interactions and views on what’s going on. Karl knows something is going badly wrong… does he communicate it to Beringer? Do either of them ever talk properly? But Beringer speaks to Enim as if he thinks he’s perfectly fine, just suffering from his guilt. Is that correct, or a front for Enim? Seriously, I’d love to see some of the backstory of this as Enim’s behaviour becomes more and more eratic yet nobody is stopping to say, “Hm, that’s not right.” \n\n-Back story! How did Jack and Enim meet? Let’s see a bit of younger Jack, actually; he can’t have been so rebellious for seven years or he’d have been kicked out. A character study on Jack in general would be great. \n\n-More back story! Let's see the Christmas where it all went wrong, or even years before. Enim's broken family fascinates me and I'd like to see it a bit more on screen  than it is in the books. \n\n-I liked that Enim almost saw Beringer as a friend; just one who was paid to spend time with him. I wouldn’t mind seeing a bit more of some of their sessions. Alternately, I wish his brief ghostly appearance in book 2 had been a little longer, since I felt it was very interesting and would like to see his role expanded. \n\nIf none of these ideas are the sort of thing you want, feel free to go your own way, as ever; I’d just be happy with any fic existing for this fandom!\n\n\n"},{"username": "Khantael","fandom": "Root Double: Before Crime After Days ","characters": null,"prompt": "Do Not Wants: Porn. I don’t have issues with characters being in relationships per se but I’m more interested in how those characters interact with eachother rather than anything on the romance side.\n\nWhat I like about Root Double is its similarity to series such as Zero Escape. I still think Route After is great in particular, though I don’t dislike any of the routes. Shout out to Route Current too which I think is greatly underappreciated, but I love a good point of view switch and Current may as well be called “Route After Revisited: Point of View Switch”, haha. \n\nI’ll link the opening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdwKxuogBbk\n\nAnyway, I’ve requested any as I would be happy with any of the four nominated characters. It’s a little hard to prompt when requesting any, so I’m just going to throw out a load of ideas now:\n\n-I mentioned above that I love a good point of view switch. I’d like to see Louise (Salyu)’s view of Route After. We know what Watase and crew do, and Natsuhiko and Mashiro are both accounted for, but we see very little of Salyu and what she’s doing particularly as she believes the radiation story. She’d also have a very different perspective of being trapped to the others because she knows there are other dangers there far before anybody else does, and she’s also totally lost track of her friends.\n\n-In Route Double, Natsuhiko suffers ill effects from his removing the malice from other people. What if he really did end up getting inflicted with the Malice himself or otherwise just got more severe (more permanent?) effects from what he’s doing. (He’s messing with people’s minds, fighting a very strong opposing force, yet there doesn’t seem to be a long term implication from this and I think there should be.) I’d like to see how this could affect him in the long term (and how Salyu and Mashiro would respond). In the “stricken by Malice” chaos, there may not be a long term!\n\n-I’d like to see Mashiro given a bigger role. She has a good role in Route Before, as well as a strong friendship, then she’s unconscious throughout Route After and still barely present in the later routes. She’s a Level 5 communicator! She may not be able to do Senses Sympathy (although I guess this could develop in the infected area of Labo), but she she’s still more experienced with Empathy and general Communicator skills than Natsuhiko is, even if his ability is higher. Let’s see Mashiro being awesome please! \n\n-Watase was a fascinating character to me. I’d like to see the different stages of Watase if you like: the young, kind Watase; grieving terrorist Watase; Malice inflicted Watase; amnesiac Watase and then the Watase who comes out of Natushiko’s Senses Sympathy repair. I’m particularly interested in the latter two or three. To have your sense of self change so rapidly could make for some very interesting reading.\n\n-Any additional events you want to throw into the Route After/Route Double time frames! More/drama/excitement/friend is always welcome! (Probably more the Route Double timeframe with this combination of characters, mind…)\n\n-An extension of the ending where Watase and Natsuhiko go together to the terrorist organisation; I’m interested by the two interacting and their obviously different sets of morals. How exactly would this work?\n\n-Mashiro’s point of view of the first LaBO incident and Natushiko’s unconsciousness; particularly interested in his awakening and obvious delusions and a more broad view of how exactly she dealt with that situation. \n\n-Salyu interacting with Natsuhiko and Mashiro in general. I really liked Salyu! Alternately, it could be her keeping running into Watase again during the events of the game, although I imagine this would be considerably less friendly. Does she ever start buying into his personality change or just believe it's a lie for the entire time anyway? Given her inability to understand emotions, there's lots of scope for misunderstandings which I'd find interesting! \n\nAs always, if you don’t like the ideas, go your own way and I’ll be happy just to have some fic for this fandom!\n\n\n"},{"username": "kiwigirl","fandom": "Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms - Mercedes Lackey ","characters": null,"prompt": "Godmother Elena (or some else, I'm not picky) dealing with like the Emperor's New Groove? or like one of those wacky Disney movie plots.
