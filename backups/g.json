I would be happy with pretty much anything that explores their relationship some more, whether that's through a plotty adventure/political scheme or something more introspective/vignette-y.

I would love, love, love to see him get his hands on John and -- short of killing or permanently hurting him -- have his way with John. Does he need to physically/psychologically torture John for a particular piece of information? Do they end up trapped alone together, and have to reluctantly work with each other to escape a terrible situation? Does Khlyen simply... abduct John so he can toy with him?

(Sayers just gives us a few quips and a bit about the household budget, but I feel sure there's more to do there!)  Does Mary ever get the detectivin' urge herself, or does she turn her share of the family brains to other pursuits?  She's clearly more like Peter than like Gerald, but she's not just a female carbon copy of him, of course.  If you felt like doing something plotty in which Mary Encounters A Mystery Or Takes On A Cause, I would be thrilled to bits, but I would be just as thrilled by something quieter showing Mary and Charles's daily life.  We see so little of it; even their courtship is really almost entirely offscreen, despite the fact that it happens over the course of a book.\n\nI'd prefer a fic where at least part of the action takes place after their marriage, because that's the time I'm most interested in, but you're more than welcome to involve her younger days too if you want.

Thanks so much for writing for me! Yuletide is my favourite time of year~ I love getting random fics and I hope that you'll like writing in my prompts. \n\nAs a general statement I really, really like fluff and happy things. All of my prompts can have comedy and humour elements and I'd really appreciate it if they did. Laughter (and fandom) is what makes life not suck! I love reading about people coming together as families, friendship, being nice to each other and people (and authors) having fun. Animals, pets, people bonding over pets, cooking (but not cooking the pets) and knitting (potentially for pets) are also appreciated plot points.\n\n<b>I AM ALSO A HUGE CROSSOVER/AU JUNKIE. </b> I love seeing how people interpret characters in new ways and novel situations and I would be totally cool if you wanted to add crossover/au elements to ANY of my prompts. I would request that you crossover with another series that I know (feel free to look at my AO3 bookmarks to see), but that would be totally awesome, like WOAH. AUs, magical realism, alternate histories and fourth wall breakage are all totally cool (and brilliant!) as well.\n\nRegarding romance, I am always happier to read about the relationship build up than I am the sex, so I would appreciate it if things stayed in the G&gt;T range (leave space for fandom!Jesus please). I am totally cool if you want to push things higher to allow for adult language/action (maybe even some heavy petting), but I'm really not a fan of PWPs. I would much prefer a fic about the characters hanging out and watching movies than them making a porno (unless it was ridiculously adorable!).\n\n<b>Serious squicks for me are dubcon, non-con, assault, bullying, embarrassment, gaslighting, bestiality, and politics.</b> I am pretty picky about my pairings (I mean who isn't?) so I would ask that if you are thinking about romance and it's not for a pairing that I mentioned, please make it G or open for interpretation.\n\nRegarding character diversity and re-interpretations, heck yeah.

I would love, love additional bottle episodes of our favourite trash lords and their bumbling adventures through the galaxy. I am particularly a HUGE fan of Lyntel and Bacta (&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3) and would love them trying to corral the rest of the Mynock crew into doing something constructive (Like not making awful choices; 'Hi, I'm Leenik *$&amp;^#ing Geelo'/ The card says 'sex.criminal' lady) or maybe them spending a well earned day at the spa with Nemo or waterpark with Tamlin. Or maybe they all have to break into a highschool for reasons!\nInclusion of the Evil!Campaign crew and all side/secondary characters is welcomed as well (with the exception of Jacinto Reth *shudders*)! OMG I'm already so excited!!\nPlease Gen to T - I'm not a big fan of any of the romance plots getting serious (although Zero/Blue - yeah ok).

Sadly, I have read almost none of the published comics, but have consulted the major online wikis and timelines thoroughly enough in the course of writing my own fics that I’m broadly familiar with much of the post-canon-but-Weisman-canonical storyline.\n\nI would strongly prefer a story featuring any two (or more) of the requested characters, but a story focused on any one character is sufficient to fill this request.  Also, feel free to include characters not in the tag set as appropriate for plot and story purposes.\n\nPROMPTS: I didn’t nominate Gargoyles this year, but I’m intrigued by the inclusion of Titania/Anastasia on the character list.  In that light, I would be particularly fascinated by a story featuring Macbeth and Anastasia – presumably this would need to be either pre-series or offscreen-during-series, perhaps during the “World Tour” arc.  (It seems likely that she’d either know of Macbeth or be able to ID his semi-magical nature, but he would not realize her faerie identity. And now that I think of it, was Macbeth actually around to see that revelation?)  Alternately, we saw so little of Macbeth and Elisa together onscreen that I’d also be fascinated by a story in which they’re drawn together, perhaps because both have been strongly committed to law and justice (if at very different times in their respective lives).  One presumes that any encounter between Demona and Anastasia would lead to fireworks, although canonically I don’t think Demona can find out about the dual identity earlier than everyone else does.  And of course Demona and Elisa have their own ongoing rivalry, which would be highly amusing to look at sometime when Goliath is not actually in the middle of it.  (Note that in these last two cases especially, Demona’s “Dominique Destine” identity may be useful.)\n\nEXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Have I mentioned lately that I’m a sucker for the well-executed crossover?  And that New York is just full of likely prospects (MCU, Young Wizards, Castle, etc.)?  I am thinking particularly of the mischief Elisa and Kate Beckett might get into together, what might happen if Macbeth and any of the Avengers were to cross paths, Black Widow and Demona facing off for some reason, or how “Anastasia Renard” might be drawn into the orbits of either Carl &amp; Tom or Nita &amp; Kit.

Additional characters welcome; suitably brain-bending crossovers totally welcome but emphatically not required.\n\nWith WIZARDS IN PLAY out, we have many of the answers we've wanted relative to Dairine and Roshaun, so I'm no longer deeply worried about excessive angst arising from that quarter.

(Or you could set such a tete-a-tete earlier in canon, while things are still unsettled....)\n\nOther possible tacks: Dairine getting one up on Nita with Carmela’s help, or the girls and the Alien Study Group having an adventure (I’ve seen a fair bit of fic in this line set in the Crossings, not so much here on Earth).

The individual mysteries are dedicated to (and often cleverly plotted in the style of) various classic and then-famous mystery authors, the characterizations are much more nuanced than is usual for this category, and there’s a strong ongoing ensemble cast (including a major and well-rendered secondary character who’s blind).\n\nNOTES: If you are one of the other eleven people who read these books back in the day, you know their niftiness and recognize the characters. If you're not, I recommend the series highly even if it is incredibly obscure.  As the prompts indicate, if – beyond all odds – you do know the fandom, I would not be opposed to romance either between Diana and Brad or her father and Lydian (there being definite canonical hints of the latter in later books).  Alternately, a story expanding on the mentor/student relationship between Diana and Lydian would be welcome, too.\n\nPROMPTS: This is one of my nano-fandoms and my Oliver Twist request -- which is to say, what I'm looking for is simply \"more\". Give me either casefic or a character moment for Diana and Brad, give me back story for Lydian (or build forward on what canon gives us of the relationship between Lydian, Diana's father, and Diana), give me a 20-years-later extrapolation...any of these will find me a very happy camper. \n\nEXTREMELY OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS: Given that these were set largely in New York (especially since one of the characters is an actual TV news professional), I’d think there’d be a lot of crossover potential for this fandom.  I myself Easter-Egged a much older Diana into one of my Castle stories some while back, but a Gargoyles, MCU, or Young Wizards cross (for instance) would also be entirely plausible.  For this purpose, see (1) my works and gifts received on AO3, and (2) all entries tagged “Dear Santa” in my  DW journal, and assume that any fandom represented therein is welcome.\n\nLetter: http://graycardinal.dreamwidth.org/51347.html\n\n\n"},{"username": "Gray Cardinal (Gray_Cardinal)","fandom": "The Ice Ghosts Mystery - Jane Louise Curry ","characters": null,"prompt": "BACKGROUND: This was a one-off mystery thriller for young readers (this being before “middle grade” and “YA” were categories) published back in 1972, which might best be described as a sort of L’Engle/Trixie Belden fusion (L’Engle for the science-fictional elements, which are clearly in the same neighborhood as Arm of the Starfish and Young Unicorns; Belden for the cheerfully determined family-of-sleuths dynamic).  Curry is better (but not nearly well enough) known for a wide range of children’s fantasy, and I kept hoping for a sequel to this that never arrived.  Curry has been gradually bringing her backlist out in Kindle editions, and at one point this was available that way; I’m not clear on whether it still is.  If not, it’s findable – and a quick read – via the usual used channels and possibly still in larger and/or kid-friendlier libraries.)\n\nPROMPTS: This book is such an ensemble piece that I've not tried to pick among the available characters.  Just give me a solid \"further adventures\" story -- whether of foiling another Evil Science Plot, coping with school/academic politics, or simply wreaking cheerful familial havoc on some unsuspecting foreign metropolis.
