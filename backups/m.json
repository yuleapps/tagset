She only appeared for one book (Happy Valley Mystery), had no dialogue, so we don't see much of her personality beyond Trixie thinking well of her after spending some time together and Jim seeming genuinely attracted to her. The most we know about Dot in canon is that she's outwardly beautiful and an excellent figure skater.\n\nWhat I want is a positive story about Dot Murray being friends with the Bob-Whites. Maybe five times she helped them/gave them advice, and one time one or all of them pulled through for her? She’s vaguely noted as somewhere from two to three years older than the thirteen/fourteen-year-old BWG girls in canon, so maybe a fic where she’s their mentor/the big sister none of them have? Casefic where she helps Trixie and Honey with a mystery, either by serving as their wheels (since Trixie and Honey don't have their licenses), going undercover as honeypot to seduce a guy or gal for information, or something else entirely?\n\nI’d also totally be down for a romance between Dot and any one of the BWGs. Do she and Jim meet up at college and start going steady? Is Dot the sultry singer in a slinky gown, stretched out on the piano and belting out torch songs, at the smoky nightclub where detective!Trixie goes to investigate? \n\nDot and Dan are both talented ice-skaters, so do they have a romance on ice? Maybe they’re older and the setup is that Dot is an Olympic figure skater with Brian as her doctor, or Honey as her costume seamstress? Maybe an AU Diana is a fashion photographer whose big break is discovering Dot as a model, or where Dot’s a superhero who has serious chemistry with investigative reporter!Mart? Anything goes, and if you want to write a poly relationship, feel free to include that as well!\n\nHonestly, for this fandom, I just want to see the BWGs being friends or romantic with Dot, so I will enthusiastically devour anything along those lines.\n\nLetter: http://maeve-of-winter.dreamwidth.org/15041.html\n\n\n"

I also would prefer not receive smut for this pairing.\n\nNote: I love all the gang, and I would be completely open to seeing any of them included in this fic. I especially love it when Reggie and Veronica show off their softer sides, and I love this page of Reggie helping Kevin choose outfits for a first date.\n\nIf you’re writing friendship fic, I would love something with them just being bros together. Maybe Jughead is there for Kevin when he breaks up with his boyfriend Devin in the original comics? Or maybe Jughead needs a school policy changed, so he goes to class president Kevin for help and they work together to get it solved?\n\nAnother pairing I really like is Kevin/Reggie. I'd love to see fic where Kevin is in trouble (lost in the wilderness, gone missing, trapped by a blizzard, etc.) and Jughead and Reggie must put aside their rivalry to rescue their respective best friend and boyfriend.\n\nI would love to see something along the lines of Kevin always picking the worst types of boyfriend imaginable, so concerned friend!Jughead decides to play matchmaker to try to help Kevin date a better kind of guy.

Either friendship or pairing fic is fine for this plot.\n\nFor a pairing, I think these two are really sweet together. I love the contrast between their personalities, and I’d love a fic that emphasized Kevin as the ultimate overachiever and Jughead as laidback and not at all bothered by anything. I can easily see Kevin becoming super stressed and running himself ragged with being involved in his various activities. Maybe Jughead does something nice to relax him, like plan a picnic or take him to the amusement park? Perhaps he cares for Kevin so much that he’s even willing to ask a favor from Veronica to help Kevin, and uses her influence to take Kevin to a fun concert or similar? Or maybe Jughead just does something to show Kevin he doesn’t have to be perfect all of the time?\n\nAnother idea is just to have other citizens of Riverdale commenting on the unlikeliness of the pairing while Kevin and Jughead have fun together. I love little bits and cameos from the various Archie characters throughout the decades.\n\nLetter: http://maeve-of-winter.dreamwidth.org/15041.html\n\n\n"

This is really how I see Reggie’s character, so it frustrates me to see him written with so few redeeming qualities. Because of this, I’d really like any type of canon divergence AU where Kevin befriends Reggie and helps him reform/brings out his better side and encourages him to be friendlier.\n\nOne aspect that does intrigue me about Reggie’s 2015 characterization is his interest in street racing. Maybe either he or Kevin race, and when one of them loses to the other, the winner makes the loser spend the day with them/be their date to a dance, or dinner, or something similar? Depending on what you’d like to do, this could either kick off their friendship or romance.\n\nAnother idea is for a friendship fic that concentrates on Reggie’s softer side. Maybe he gets roped in to helping out with a fundraiser or something similar for detention, and he ends up working alongside Kevin, who’s freely volunteering. They begin to bond, and Reggie realizes he actually really likes the work and likes hanging out with Kevin?\n\nOr maybe a cause that’s important to Reggie needs serious aid (perhaps the animal shelter where he adopted Vader?) so Reggie goes to Kevin to help him out, and they work together to save it? Or Kevin winds up in serious trouble, and Reggie bails him out? Just something with Reggie showing that he really is a good guy deep down, and becoming friends with Kevin along the way.\n\nIn the classic comics, Kevin was pursued by a secret admirer, who eventually turned out to be this guy named Paul who was totally harmless.

Kevin is shown to be have some experience with wilderness survival, but perhaps he gets hurt or sick and Reggie proves what a good guy he is by taking care of him?\n\nFor a pairing, feel free to use any of the prompts above, just with a romantic twist. \n\nAnother idea I'd like to see is Reggie spending time with Kevin, and Kevin is just his friendly self, which brings Reggie to fall for him. Maybe it's a gradual thing and it takes sometime for Reggie to realize his feelings, or maybe Reggie knows what he wants right away. I really like the idea of Kevin becoming involved in all sorts of extracurriculars, and Reggie signing up for them, too, as he realizes he wants to be with Kevin. I would just really like to see Reggie realizing he can let his guard down around Kevin without fear of looking weak or making himself vulnerable.\n\nLetter: http://maeve-of-winter.dreamwidth.org/15041.html\n\n\n"

Maybe after Jughead is expelled, Kevin takes their dispute to the next level and tries to use as much as he can to discredit Stanger? And while he’s out trying to dig up dirt to use against him, Stanger knows what he’s doing and is trying to find ways of discrediting him? I’d just love to see a fic about these two trying to outsmart each other and always just managing to escape whatever trouble the other is causing for them.\n\nFor a pairing, I’d really like a fic of Stanger just creepily perving on Kevin and trying to “save” him from “troublemakers” like Jughead, Archie, and Betty and isolate him so he can manipulate him. Maybe Stanger has warped standard where he's totally okay with brainwashing teenagers in soldiers but can’t handle the idea of being attracted to a teenager, so he tries to convince himself the reason he likes to watch Kevin during gym class and invites him to private lunches with him is because he thinks Kevin would make the perfect soldier? I think it would be great if Kevin was aware Stanger’s attitude about him was weird but didn’t quite pick up on everything, but Colonel Keller did and instantly rushed in to shut Stanger down and bust him as a disgraced spy. \n\nOr maybe Stanger takes it up a notch when his plans are discovered by Jughead and the gang sooner, so he has to go on the run and takes Kevin as a hostage, only to find himself strongly attracted to him? Feel free to do something with internal conflict and Stockholm Syndrome on Kevin’s behalf, or just have him nobly fighting Stanger the entire time.\n\nI’d also like a fic with Principal Stanger lusting over Kevin and using some leverage to coerce him into having sex with him. Perhaps Kevin goes to appeal Jughead’s expulsion, and Stanger makes a deal that if Kevin has sex with him, he’ll let Jughead back into school, and then at the end reveals he already agreed with Jughead’s dad to lift the expulsion anyway? For extra angst bonus points, Kevin could have an unrequited crush on Jughead, and Stanger could taunt him with the knowledge that his feelings aren’t returned as he fucks Kevin. Feel free to be as vague or explicit with the sex as you like; I’m just really interested in the power dynamics at play with this situation.\n\nAnother thing I'd be super down to read is Kevin, as a high school student, having a loveless and angst-ridden fling with Stanger once Stanger arrives at Riverdale High. Maybe he has a legitimate attraction (which Stanger doesn't return outside of the physical) or he just needs a rebound from a terrible relationship. Stanger can either be the villain he was in the comics, or just the cold hardass principal. Maybe he and Kevin get stuck in a lot of meetings together due to Kevin's involvement in student government and other extracurriculars, and they end up beginning an affair. I'd love to see Kevin angsting over the knowledge that they can't be caught in a relationship together and knowing that they don't love each other, but desperately wanting to be with someone. He knows he's in a illicit relationship devoid of legitimate affection, and keeping it a secret is making him paranoid, but at the same time, he can't seem walk away from it. Just all the angst and indecision and internal conflict.\n\nOr if you want to go in a humor/crack direction, I'd love to see Kevin falling for Stanger for some super geeky reason (\"His speech at the track banquet was so well-paced! He complimented my planning skills at the student government meeting last week!) and blatantly hitting on him, much to the exasperation/disbelief of his friends and the discomfort of the teaching staff. (I love all of the Riverdale faculty, and I would love to see them dealing with this awkward situation.) Stanger can either be oblivious because he's too busy with his megalomaniacal plotting, or annoyed and impatient because Kevin's obvious attempts to seduce him are a constant distraction from his megalomaniacal plotting.\n\nLetter: http://maeve-of-winter.dreamwidth.org/15041.html\n\n\n"

Actually, if you like it, feel free to ignore the movie entirely. I’d love to see a different take on Falcon’s origins. I know it’s canon that Falcon often screws up and goofs off, but I’d really prefer any fic about him to portray him as a talented agent and someone who takes his job seriously and does it well.\n\nI’m a hurt/comfort junkie, so feel free to use any hurt/comfort tropes you like for Falcon, as long as he’s able to recover from his injuries.\n\nIf you’d like to go in a humor/crack direction, I really love the idea of Duke being an overprotective older brother, sort of like Thor and Loki in this MCU fic, and Falcon tolerating it but also sometimes becoming exasperated with Duke’s antics.\n\nSimilarly, maybe you would like to a fic about five times one of the Joes found Falcon hot but was too intimidated by Duke to make a move, and the one time a Joe got the nerve to ask Falcon out?\n\nIf you want to do a type of origin story for Falcon in lieu of the movie events, I think it would be cool if Falcon joined the Joes to prove himself to Duke, but to prevent Duke from interfering, completed his initial training to be accepted into the Joes with Sergeant Slaughter and the Renegades rather than with Beach Head.\n\nI really like the idea of Falcon being Duke’s unofficial and silent support assistant within the Joes, who goes the extra mile to ensure things run smoothly. I would love a fic where a visiting general comes along and the Joes need his approval to secure new funds or to continue operating, and the guy propositions Falcon, who agrees as long as the Joes get what they need in return. Falcon feels guilty and ashamed, but he is also convinced he did the right thing to help the Joes. Maybe [character of your choice] finds out and then comforts him afterward?\n\nIf you’d like to use an angsty backstory for Falcon, I thought of this idea where he gets into drugs at 17/18 years old and becomes involved with the Headman or some other neerdowell, and, unbeknownst to his family, prostitutes himself for drugs or drug money. The Headman can either be his pimp or just his dealer. Perhaps one of the Joes finds Falcon, helps him straighten out, and then brings him into the team. How do these events effective Falcon in forming other romantic relationships?\n\nI’d also be really eager for a fic with Falcon showing off his skills and proving his competence and gaining admiration from the other Joes.\n\n If you’d like to write a mission fic, I would love to see Falcon and any one of the Joes to go undercover as a couple. Whether it’s for laughs or actually leads to the two of them getting together is up to you.\n\nIf you wanted to write a plot based on an episode, I’d be fine with anything, but I think it would be really cool if one of the Joes fully realizing his or her feelings for Falcon in a “There’s No Place Like Springfield”-type of scenario.\n\nLetter: http://maeve-of-winter.dreamwidth.org/15041.html\n\n\n"

I'd love something going into how normal people and psychics relate, as it's something incredibly important to the story, but not used at all. Are there psychic sympathizers? More peaceful liberation groups? Previous attempts at revolution? One of Burn's biggest weaknesses is that his entire plan is \"let's forget about all this nonsense and go home\" without really addressing why NOA exists or is so extreme. I don't think he's bad, just kind of naive. Is there any way for him to break out of that and for Keith to break out of terrorism? (read: is it at all possible to get my OTP together without suffering?) Pretty much anything with Burn and Keith and their tumultuous relationship is good.\n\nI just like Patty in general. What was her childhood like? How long has she been on her own? How did she meet up with Might, and how did they become friends instead of fighting? What happens to her after the game? Can the time loop break? \n\nI like Wendy a lot too, both as the spunky kid character in 2010 or the older, sadder kid in 2012. She's been through a lot and she still gets one of the happiest endings for a good character - and that's still losing two of the three people she cares about. What does she do after 2012? Is there any conflict with Burn about how she killed Keith? What was her childhood like with Chris? How did she join NOA? What was she up to inbetween 2010 and 2012? \n\nI know Patty and Wendy never interact in game, but I'd kind of like to see them meet in fic. I think they'd have a much less chance of killing each other on sight than most of the rest of the cast, and both of them deserve to hang out with a friend for a little bit :) \n\nBurn/Keith is encouraged, Patty/Wendy could be fun, I think Wendy has a one-sided crush/longing for Burn (or just the stability he represents) but I can't see him reciprocating.\n\nLetter: http://marsdragon.dreamwidth.org/1757.html\n\n\n"

More about how magic and runes work would also be great. Just how influential are the True Runes?\n\nFor something a bit more character-focused, what does it mean if Gremio comes back out of the Soul Eater? What happens when he dies a second time? The idea of him picking up a True Rune so Tir won't be alone again is interesting, but would that have any consequences after his resurrection? (Soul Eater not wanting to give up its snack, maybe)  \n\nOr Tir wandering around centuries later. How does he adjust to the changes in the world? I think it would be interesting to see him interact with or become a historian. How does the party line differ from what he remembers, and is what he remembers even still accurate? Human memory is such a fragile thing... \n\nMy prompts for Ted are similar to Tir, but in reverse. He's also surprisingly immature and bad at hiding his true nature, which is weird considering he's supposed to have been doing this for the past three or four hundred years.

He’ll do things that are SO childish yet SO satisfying, like the time he threw his towel at a referee. I love how he plays up the dumb jock thing because he’ll also talk about how cool it is that Alex knows so much stuff and how he can ask him anything because Alex always has an interesting response.

From the beginning he alternates between needling William and performing these extremely thoughtful favors for him, although it's not always easy for him to get under William's skin since William perversely enjoys some of his bluntness. He brings out such an interesting side of Frances when he meets her, too -- I love that promptly she gets into three arguments with him in a row, and the third time she doesn't even believe in the argument she's making; she just wants to fight with him!\n\nI'm particularly interested in a story set when William and Frances are living in England and Hunsden is their neighbor. I love how he has apparently latched onto their family in lieu of starting their own, especially the way he seems to practically be a coparent to Victor when he’s at home. I would love more about their daily life as it's sketched all too briefly in that last chapter, or a story about something that happens as Victor gets older and goes to school, which William worries about.\n\nI would also love threesome fic! William would be almost hopelessly scandalized by the prospect, I think, and surely Frances too, but then with the dynamic both she and Hunsden have with William where they love to tease him I can imagine it working out somehow. I do love stories where characters fumble their way into unusual relationships or sexual practices without quite knowing what they're doing or having the usual vocabulary to talk about it, which is sort of what I would picture. But I would be just as happy with a story that explores the dynamic among them that wasn’t threesome fic.\n\n\n"

Now that we have volume 1 translated, I can only say that I’m glad for the series and glad to have a new cast of characters to explore.\n\nWhat I love about the characters I’ve chosen is their dynamic with Waver. Flat makes life chaotic, oh yes, but Waver endures him for some reason - apparently out of concern for Flat’s safety, if the wiki is anything to go by. Gray is absolutely fascinating as a character because of her lineage, yes, but also because she’s stuck beside Waver and acts as his assistant. I’d love to see more of that, and then, then there’s Reines. I adore the relationship we’ve seen between Reines and Waver so far, with her treating him like a servant or sibling depending on what she needs from him. This particular relationship strikes me as the most unique in the series, as it’s very much a patronage sort of arrangement, with enough close affection for it to be genuine but an unshakeable power dynamic as well.\n\nHonestly, there’s a lot I’d like to see. An exploration of what the above relationships are like beyond what we’re given in canon would be lovely. For example, we know in Fate/apocrypha that Flat sometimes takes VH out to the movies, but that serves to pose more questions like what kind of low-key shenanigans happen on a daily basis? How does the group say, control VH’s terminator outbursts? How have Reines and Waver developed their relationship since he was first given the Lord El-Melloi II title? How does Gray spend her days off when she isn’t around Waver? What challenges faces this group as a whole? Or perhaps there are other cases they’ve gotten into that we haven’t seen. \n\nThen again, there’s also the conclusion of volume one of the Case Files, where Waver agrees that he would take Gray to the next Grail War so she could meet Rider. How might that meeting go? What would Rider think of Gray, and Waver being halfway between her teacher and her parent?\n\nLetter: http://megkips.dreamwidth.org/1846569.html\n\n\n"

I’d love to see how she decided on her Top Five Hotties list (no English translation but the list speaks for itself), or else what she does when she isn’t running the shop.

I have it on good authority that he makes one fucking adorable narrator (novella-shaped case in point: Wings in the Morning), but why stop there, right?\n\n-  Luke/Elliot, either post-canon or slightly amending canon, is always a delight. Luke crushing on Elliot for years in a resigned, semi-unaware (or aware!) manner - he gives Elliot Dale’s name only as a distraction, to get Elliot off his back, and watches with horrified eyes how every member of his family is suddenly out there to set him up with the wrong boy! Luke handling the thought of Elliot the boyfriend with awkwardness unbefitting a Trigon champion (granted, Elliot is kinda more prickly than an average glass ball). Luke having 110% confidence in Elliot and admiring him sass people into submission from the sidelines.\n\n- A look at Luke’s friendship with Serene - completely compatible with Luke forever crushing on Elliot, just saying ^^. I suspect lack of Elliot’s Serene goggles could do marvels to building nuance to her character: a little less reverse gender comedy just for the sake of comedy, a little more someone who is clever enough to balance multiple things, connect the dots, and learn, and stand by what she believes is right.\n\n-  Competence kinkkk. Forever admiring the bookish people, refusing to stop trying to catch up, and zero time spent being conceited about own achievements while fully embracing his role of a champion and defender - that’s the Luke I love &lt;3 Luke’s brand of leadership &amp; charisma - an introverted champion, well-loved by people and easily tired of company of not his people.\n\n- Figuring out life after graduation! Casefic of them solving a mystery and preventing a war breakout! Getting assignments and storming the castles! Building cross-cultural competence by throwing Elliot at new people and watching him sign up new pen friends and treaties!\n\n-  Sunborn family fic! A holiday get together? Drunken exchange of family stories? Another terrible competition that Elliot boycotts? Rachel reading Luke’s letters from year one and with great amusement observing the progression of his “THAT ELLIOT” feelings. God I love the Sunborns &lt;3\n\nI’m not particularly fond of Dale, on understanding that he got enough screentime as is already I’d be grateful if you didn’t center the fic around him.

Any story format is alright - drabble/flashfic collection, oneshot, multichapter (a dream, haha!). Just not theatre script or just dialogue, please.\nThank you very much for reading!\nHope you have fun writing this. I know I will when I'll read it :D\n\n\n"

	"prompt": "Dear Yuletide author,\nThe Amnesia game was one of last year's greatest fandom discoveries, for me, and I'd love to read some Ukyo x Heroine goodness for Xmas :D\nIt would be awesome if you could use a setting that scrambled the various worlds together and made the heroine remember all of a sudden all her past lives, with related conflicts and loves and betrayals. Even better if the boys remembered one by one too, some time after seeing her (in my mind they all know each other, like in Ukyo's world; it could also be set there?). Shin would be the first.\nMuch angst, doubts and conflicting desires would arise while everyone tries to decide if they want/should pursue her. Heroine would feel confused and guilty, because she cares for them all yet there is too much among them now - not to mention the fact that she 'should' be with Ukyo this time, after choosing the others so many times.\nI've liked pretty much all routes (minus Toma's); Shin's is my favourite despite his bad mouth, I think his relationship with Heroine is the strongest - so he should be the main rival. I like Ukyo too, despite his madness; he  made a great sacrifice that, in time, transformed him into a monster. Overcoming that madness and working out its causes should be one of the major point of the story.\n\nI know that working with too specific a prompt can be an inspiration-killer, though, so if all of the above doesn't click with you, I'll be ecstatic with romantic smut or fluff too! Possibly with Heroine (whom I've always called Mai) holding back out of fear, then being assertive and not just an understanding doormat. Definitely max joy with playful, smutty fluff!\n\nI've played only Amnesia Memories and read the handful of manga chapters that were translated by a couple of bloggers.\nI LOVE heavy angst, especially when there is a happy resolution (if there's a touch of bittersweet = squee). I also love quick, to-the-point dialogues and wordplay. I have no major squicks but don't like S/M, overbearing love interests nor death fic (though it's a moot point with this fandom, lol). All ratings go, though I'm partial to mature themes and situations - not necessarily smutty, but if there are, even better!\nI appreciate all story formats, from drabble collection to longfic.\nHope you have fun writing this!

	"prompt": "I'm requesting both Varis and Shalindra as characters, but I don't need them both to appear on-screen or in POV--what I'm really just dying to get is some kind of fic that gives me another taste of their interactions with and impact on each other. Their time together is one of the most interesting parts of the book for me, but necessity of pacing means that the weeks of time Shalindra spends as Varis's hostage/'guest' gets swept past rather quickly, so a fic expanding on that time period is one thing I'd love to see. A couple of sentences, for examples, mention that once Shalindra is being kept in better conditions she and Varis usually dine together, so what did that look like? What did they talk about? (Dinner scenes that are tense or emotionally charged in some way are one of my favorite things to read, so this is one of those skimmed-over details that I desperately wish we had an actual example of in the book!) I have to admit I'm also darkly tempted by the thought of an AU where the proposed marriage went through for whatever reason--how in the world would both of them have navigated that relationship?--or where Shalindra didn't quite have the strength to ask Varis to take her out of the crypt, and gave in to the unspoken offer of further instruction in necromancy.\n\nVaris's POV scene during some point of Shalindra's captivity could be really interesting, too. We only get a few scenes from his perspective in the latter part of the novel, but the couple of times we do his thoughts about Shalindra are very striking--particularly that scene were he's in a post-necromancy waking nightmare and thinks of her face and her voice as a point of light and sanity in the madness. Something about his first impressions of her once she's been captured, maybe, or his thoughts after the crypt scene?\n\nOr I'd love to see some kind of Shalindra fic set post-canon, as the conclusion is a pretty interesting happy-yet-not ending--Shalindra's been too changed to celebrate her brother's victory and Varis's defeat the way she once would have, and certain elements of her world are already starting to feel grating, unsatisfying, or dull to her. So I always wonder: what is she going to do from now on? Is she truly going to manage to resist the lure of necromancy for the rest of her life? Or would she take advantage of her new position and resources--a titled noble, with time and money and the research skills that come from her years as an enforced scholar at Fruce--and begin exploring the forbidden art again?\n\nGiven the situation Varis is in at the book's conclusion (spifflicated in that shack in the woods and so ragged and dishelved that the few patrols who've come across him haven't recognized him), it's very unlikely that Shalindra will encounter him again after the book's end--but if she did turn back to necromancy and let a sufficient number of years pass, might she able to summon his ghost? Would she try to do it, if only to assuage her own curiosity about him and why he'd let her go? I don't know how lucid a ghost!Varis would be--I can't remember if we see any ghosts of spifflicates in the book--but the two of them having one last conversation and their previous power dynamic of captor/captive being so completely reversed into necromancer/ghost is an idea I can't get out of my brain.\n\nMy dislikes/DNWs are:\n- blatant character-bashing\n- mundane/modern AUs\n- A/B/O of any kind\n- body fluids besides blood, sweat, and tears\n- damage to eyes, teeth, fingernails, and inner ears\n- incredibly detailed descriptions of insects and arachnids\n- graphic violence to/torture of animals\n\nLetter: http://melmillo.dreamwidth.org/1172.html\n\n\n"

	"prompt": "If gen fic is your speed, anything that draws from the warm and genuine friendliness that Jovvi and Tamrissa have in the books would delight me. Their initial connection and developing relationship was one of the best parts of the first couple of volumes for me and I was always a little disappointed that we didn't get more of that as the books went on, so any kind of fic that includes a good dose of that would be a treat for me--anything from fluffy curtainfic (shopping! tea-drinking! doing anything pleasant and fun to distract themselves from the conspiracy they've gotten wrapped up in!) to something more tense and dramatic where they're supporting each other through upsetting moments. It would have been nice to get a more emotional scene after Jovvi's near-kidnapping in the second book, or one when they reunite after they've BOTH been kidnapped in the fourth book, so filling in that gap would be lovely!\n\nIf you want to write smut, there's always fixing that illogical canon fact of 'Everyone having sex with each other will make your Blending stronger--oh, but only the men with the women, of course! No same-sex hookups here!' Maybe it turns out that all the Blending partners really do need to couple off and bang each other at least once; maybe Jovvi and Tamrissa think and talk it through and come to the logical conclusion that even though they weren't told *they* had to have sex with each other, they should probably do so just in case. (Maybe one or both of them have been tentatively drawn to the other, and they're just using 'for the good of the Blending' as an excuse!) Or--we know Tamrissa's former husband was rough and cruel during sex, and in the books her first sexual experience after him is with Rion, which...okay, sure, go for the guy who literally just lost his virginity a few days ago, whatever. How about instead she goes to Jovvi, who's highly skilled in this area and has the added bonus of a Spirit talent that can help keep Tamrissa feeling safe, calm, and comfortable throughout? Or there's that bit where Tamrissa learns from Jovvi that Fire talents really do have the ability to arouse people by 'setting their blood on fire'--maybe Jovvi could suggest that if Tamrissa would like to learn how to get better at it, she can practice on Jovvi?\n\nIf you'd like to do something AUish, I'd adore a fic about the two of them skipping out of the main plot and whatever prophecy nonsense was going on and doing their own thing. Maybe they leave the city (or the entire country) and just live in peaceful reclusive bliss elsewhere. Maybe they do what Jovvi suggests in the first book and become an awesome courtesan duo and make scads of money at it. Maybe they, IDK, use their High talents to become elegant upper-class spies or adventuresses or something. I just love the idea of them ditching their somewhat aggravating canon love interests and going off to live a happy life of luxury, indulging in chocolate and beautiful clothes and great sex (with each other and maybe with whatever men they feel like) for the rest of their days.\n\nMy dislikes/DNWs are:\n- blatant character-bashing\n- mundane/modern AUs\n- A/B/O of any kind\n- body fluids besides blood, sweat, and tears\n- damage to eyes, teeth, fingernails, and inner ears\n- incredibly detailed descriptions of insects and arachnids\n- graphic violence to/torture of animals\n\nLetter: http://melmillo.dreamwidth.org/1172.html\n\n\n"

	"characters": "Gabrielle Deschain (Dark Tower - Stephen King)",
	"prompt": "Oh dear, where to start with Gabrielle? I think what I'd most love to see in general is a fic that lets her be the central focus and doesn't come through Roland's point of view. I like Roland well enough (I don't know if you can get through the series if you don't!) but sometimes the hints of other stories happening around and behind him make me wish I could nudge him out of the way for a little bit to get a better look at what's going on, and Gabrielle's a major instance of that. Her life and death, what she does and what's done to her, have a tremendous effect on Roland and thus on the course of the books as a whole--but so much of what we get of her in the canon is as a shadow and a memory filtered through the particular cast of Roland's recollection and emotions, and that's such a limited view of her. I realize the canon is pretty overstuffed with material as it is, but it's still frustrating to me that Gabrielle's living her way through an entire damn operatic tragedy in service to the overall story but gets so little time of her own as an actual character. There's that one critical scene of her on-page in The Gunslinger, and the broken snippets of her own thoughts in the note she leaves for Roland in The Wind Through the Keyhole--and, arguably, the story about Tim in The Wind Through the Keyhole *might* have touches of her personality and mindset hidden in the details too, since Roland's trying to tell it exactly as it was told to him by Gabrielle....\n\nThat's not a lot! So I'd adore just about any kind of fic that moves her into the foreground of the story. Something about the early days of her marriage and her time as the Lady of Gilead? We never find out much about what ladies of Gabrielle's sort do in their day-to-day life, so that could be fertile ground for exploration. A better look at the webs and threads of the Steven-Gabrielle-Marten saga? I would love ANY perspective other than Roland's on Gabrielle and her role in that whole fucked-up situation, honestly, or anything that really dug down to the marrow of the Gabrielle/Steven and Gabrielle/Marten relationships. Exactly what went on during her time in Debaria after the affair? What was she thinking about? How did she interact with the sisters there? Even something about her childhood and upbringing, if you feel like going totally off the map of what we know about her! There are little slivers of dropped info about her that could spin off into an interesting story: the fact that we know her father's name (TWO names, actually, since King and his editor apparently weren't keeping close track of that) but not her mother's; her own various names from her homeland; the rhymes and stories she told Roland.... What sort of things did she like to do? What did she hope for herself in her life? Which of the things she did were choices she made herself, and which were ones other people (or ka) made for her? I'd also be happy to see canon-divergent fic, if you want to play around with what-ifs and might-have-happeneds. I don't know if it's possible to pull out a happy ending for her (though if inspiration strikes I certainly won't discourage you!), but so much of what happens in the books is the result of people making specific decisions at specific moments--we have that one instance of Gabrielle at Debaria struggling to make the correct choice, and choosing what she does because she feels it's demanded of her. It could be interesting to see instances where she--or the people around her--make different choices throughout her life, and how that wrenches the overall story of her and the world in different directions!\n\nMy dislikes/DNWs are:\n- blatant character-bashing\n- mundane/modern AUs\n- A/B/O of any kind\n- body fluids besides blood, sweat, and tears\n- damage to eyes, teeth, fingernails, and inner ears\n- incredibly detailed descriptions of insects and arachnids\n- graphic violence to/torture of animals\n\nLetter: http://melmillo.dreamwidth.org/1172.html\n\n\n"

We don't get to see a whole lot of Golden but I love that he's basically a feisty Regency romance heroine and I want him and Elliot to be best friends. You can write about them all together or in any combination you want -- I would be especially interested in Golden getting to know Elliot or something about Luke and Serene's star-crossed sisterhood, and of course Luke/Elliot in the foreground or background would be delightful because I am nothing if not predictable. I love outsider POV and we don't get to hear a lot of what Serene thinks throughout the book, so getting her perspective on events could be cool.

And what a great starting point! I've been so excited to see this scenario unfold -- I don't really like jealousy or love triangles but Elliot and Clinton both realizing how great (and genuinely kind, which is my favorite thing about both of them) the other is made my heart grow three sizes. I love Brun and how direct she is and I think that if anyone could handle making it work with the Softest Bro and Highest Strung Nerd, it's her. With that said, I know that Brun's sexual orientation has yet to be revealed and I think it would be entirely in character for her to set boundaries on what she is and isn't interested in doing. That's totally fine! OT3 is not a one-size-fits-all dynamic, and I think there are tons of different takes on how their relationship would play out. (If you *want* to write asexual femdom Brun, GO FOR IT.)

I'm sure Temeraire and Perscitia could manage it if they put their minds to it. I also love AUs of all stripes and adore many of the minor characters (especially Perscitia, Jane, Emily, Lady Allendale, Berkeley and Maximus, and Catherine and Lily). If you were feeling the holiday spirit, something like Tharkay's first time hosting a big Christmas shindig at his Fuck Off Racist Cousins estate would be a lovely opportunity to get everyone together!

So if you’re not jamming with my Arisaydia and Nikys prompts it's totally cool to just write about Pen and Desdemona being adorable -- maybe Des teaching Pen something from her past lives or Pen giving Des presents. Speaking of Pen giving presents, however... it has always struck me that since Desdemona likes it when Pen's body has nice things and (most of) Desdemona likes good-looking guys, something that Pen might potentially give her is sex with a good-looking guy. Perhaps Arisaydia, who canonically thinks that Pen is a pretty hot lady when he's done up in drag? (Mira's Last Dance is a GIFT to us all.) Mostly I'm interested in the complicated dynamics that would arise from Pen and Des sharing a body but having different lovers, plus the potential weirdness of Nikys and Arisaydia sharing or not-sharing Penric. (The whole situation makes me think of a historical anecdote I read once about conjoined twins who married a pair of sisters.) I personally am fine with both incest and quasi-incest for this fandom and would also be delighted if you wanted to go straight to OT4 land! Nikys and Arisaydia's relationship to each other is so interesting, and uncomfortably intense sibling devotion is absolutely my jam. Nikys probably already has complicated feelings about the joint ownership of Pen's body, and I love her budding friendship with Desdemona, so if you're not down with Arisaydia getting involved, I'd also be interested in Des helping Pen convince Nikys to stay with them, or Des helping Nikys convince Pen to go with her.

I genuinely think that she and Sh'gall were not as poor in their relationship as the crisis of the Plague showed. I have no issue with her having previous relationships with B'lerion or D'say or Talpan. I ship her and Alessan deeply, and if you AU events to save her, prefer a poly relationship that includes Nerilka.

Please don't feel obligated to comply with any of the following suggestions.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the more recent half of Taichi's arc in the manga has always been about Suou's ability to see that Taichi does not implicity enjoy karuta. Taichi doesn't have the fiery passion that Chihaya and Arata have, hasn't played consistently from a young age like so many of the other giants in the karuta world canonically have. And I've always felt that this was a part of Taichi that Chihaya was always blind to because it was so hard for Chihaya to think that somebody could simply not love karuta. So I really loved that Taichi was able to address this issue with Suou and kind of grow from that. I also just love Suou \"teaching\" Taichi his cruel kind of karuta. Yet, I still dont really know how Taichi feels about Suou and vice versa? I'd love any kind of day-to-day, slice of life Taichi and Suou interaction. A quick splash of their friendship. Again, feel free to do something completely different if you would like to, I would enjoy anything I receive.\n\nI would prefer a non AU, but anything else goes.\n\n\n"

The push and pull of their individual insecurities and desires balanced with their surprisingly wholesome relationship where they genuinely care about each other's well being is just so full of possibilites and emotions. They're both so obviously imperfect, but love each other so fiercely. It's both so dangerously co-dependant, but also filled with somthing tantalizingly intimate. I'd love anything pre- or post- canon (or both!) centering on their relationship in any way (and this can include any of their relationships with other characters in canon). \n\nI would prefer a non AU, but anything else goes.\n\n\n"

Maybe Kazul is writing a book of her own specifically for dragons, such as <i>Managing and Maintaining Your Princess</i>, that’s comparing Cimorene to some of the past princesses she’s had. Or Kazul has to go settle some dragon dispute and brings Cimorene along. Maybe they go on a diplomatic mission/attend a wedding, either visiting foreign dragons or staying as guests in a human castle, and whacky hijacks ensure.\n\nI would prefer this particular fandom stay in the original universe, or something similar to the original.

I knew I'd have to nominate and request it, come Yuletide. :) It's hardly a historically accurate piece but I don't care.\n\nFirst things first. Yes, I ship these two, I'm not gonna lie. But! The reason I like these two together is the fact that they need each other. One has lost a father he barely got to know, and one has lost a son. They're broken. The scene with \"Let me love you like a son to a father.\" pretty much covers it all. So it's perfectly fine to view them as totally 100% platonic. Maybe have them interested in other people, or leave romance out of it completely.\n\nAny glimpse at their life post-movie would be lovely, gen or shippy or something in between.

Just one or two is enough. (Pun not intended. :D)\n\nI'm stuck mid-S3, but I'll be done with the whole season by reveals, so don't fear dropping spoilers. It also explains why my comments might look off or somehow lacking. It's because I don't know the whole story yet. But! This show! Omg! I'm gutted S3 is all we're going to get. I love this world. ♥ These people and the ship and the worldbuilding and all of it. So I'd be happy with anything you want to write.\n\nI chose a few characters, and it's funny (to me, anyway) that they all share a common denominator: Three. As in I ship Three with every single one of them. :D But that's because I ship Three with just about everyone. You can probably tell why. It's just how he is. But I'm fine if you don't do slash and only prefer gen stuff. Friendshippy bonding is equally loved. Or, you know, them just hanging out and/or hunting each other like mortal enemies. Any interaction is good, even antagonistic. :D\n\nThese are snagged and remixed from my earlier prompts:\n\nThree: I love him. Period. He and Two are my favourites and I doubt anything during the latter half of S3 can change that. I love how he can be a combination of a clueless oaf and an efficient fighter <i>and</i> someone who's filled with bottled emotions and a huge heart. He's the kind of guy you want on your side, because he'll take care of you (unless he's jailed or shot or otherwise tied up) and be your loyal friend and entertain you with dumb jokes (intentionally or un, depending) and so much more. And he's super easy on the eye. :D I ship him with these three but also Four and Six, and he and Five are friends for life.\n\nAnders: We don't get to know much about him, which just makes me want to know more. Anything focusing on his life would be lovely. I wouldn't mind if it included something shippy with Six, but it's completely optional. And since the beginning of S3? Anders/Three! Canon divergence! Something!\n\nOne: I like the guy! I like that not every male in the crew is an alpha macho gun-wielding butchfest. We need the pretty ones, too! And he <i>can</i> handle a weapon, so all's good. :)\n\nWith One and Three? All the snark, all the banter, all the reluctant affection against their better judgment! I miss the chemistry between these two. The dislike and mistrust and competition, the friendship that comes from being in the same situation. I'd like anything that plays off their differences and similarities. Getting into trouble together, blaming each other and ending up with bruises but still thinking the other guy isn't so bad. This can take place before S1 began when they were Marcus and Derrick, or they can be One and Three before One got killed, or you can bring One back somehow and make it a big reunion fight and love fest. :D World-hopping between alternate timelines is always welcome, and with this one it wouldn't even be completely uncanonical.\n\nKierken: Ah, poor Kierken and his manhunt. What happens when he finally catches Three, or does he? Do they just hook up for one time as a part of Three's plot to free himself or could there be more? Or give me Three's POV. Give me him teasing Kierken with his escapes and loving every moment of it. Or just give me Kierken on his own, a day in his life, or a mission that has nothing to do with Raza. One that failed, one that he totally owned, anything. What's it like to be Kierken and how much does he enjoy the chase, as slippery as his targets may be?\n\nI also like the idea of more worldbuilding featuring any of these characters. I loved the sci-fi feel of S2 and my favourite episodes were those where we got glimpses of what else is out there, the new places and new tech and new people they met. And time jumps are always close to my heart. But also, and this is not the least even when it's the last, I love all sorts of bonding between them. Any of them.\n\nOther people I love: The, uh, whole cast? Ok, like I said already, especially Two. ♥ But also Five and the Android, and Four before he became Ryo again. Though I'm starting to almost see Ryo's POV, as scary as it is. I'm not super into Sarah, so maybe keep her to a minimum if you must include her? Other minor characters (like Truffault or Teku) are also welcome, if you can fit them somewhere.\n\nLetter: http://mimm.dreamwidth.org/3086.html\n\n\n"

Something that's maybe less comical and more serious? But I adore the comedy-style so if you're even a tiny bit worried about style, don't be! Do comedy! Do a missing episode! A missing scene! Anything! I love the subtle and not so subtle references to historical people, events and even gadgets, but I'd be equally happy if there were none. As long as it's Gordon, I'm happy. :)\n\nI'd love to read about his life outside the episodes. Maybe a missing scene? Something he references - like the time ladies wanted to buy his services and he was completely clueless - but maybe in a \"this is how it happened\" kind of way. Or his life after Hut 33's events, during war or post-war or even when he's in his 20s. Does he have any friends outside the co-workers and how does he interact with them? Did he learn to wear real trousers and did he celebrate it? Does he ever learn how to date (either men or women, I'm not picky)?\n\nIf you have an idea for something else, go with that instead. I'm not very hard to please with this fandom. :) Even if the whole cast is there, as long as Gordon's featured in a role that's more than tapestry (unless it's Minka teaching him how to look like tapestry) I'll be happy.\n\nLetter: http://mimm.dreamwidth.org/3086.html\n\n\n"

He's not a bee, so how did he come by his knowledge of the occult?  Is it really just a product of taking to the road?  What other occult disasters has he been through?  What really happened that time in New Orleans?  Or he mentions all the factions have tried to recruit him - how did that go?  (I assume it wasn't the same as the ones we see, given the difference circumstances.)\n\nLetter: http://moontyger.dreamwidth.org/767563.html\n\n\n"

What is the home life of either or both of these girls like?  Do parents ever not want their daughter to be a magical girl?  Were Undine's parents really ok with her going back out after what happened to her team?  What was it like at normal school when girls began having dreams and becoming magical girls?  Is the transition to being a magical girl a difficult one?  Why did Kokoro decide to fight on her own rather than joining a team?\n\nI'd be fine with a darker fic, too.  How much have people in this city really forgotten?  We know the girls forget part of their dreams and Undine does not remember why someone could hate her, so loss of memory seems a real theme here.  Is there something about the city that causes it?  How often do magical girls die or become seriously injured?

Of course, because I am a sucker for romance, I immediately went to a shippy place. Is it true love and if so, how do they deal with that after becoming enemies? Did Zarina figure out a dust to make him understand her and decide to only use it on him? How angsty did their affair get when he decided to betray her? Did they keep going back to each other throughout the years, even as their respective camps became more and more enemies?\n\nMy perfect fic would be scenes of them throughout the years, getting angstier and angstier as time goes on (and then super nostalgic at the end, when they figure out that they have been enemies for so long when they could have worked so well together, siiigh). I would love all of these: How did Zarina convince him to let her became part of the crew, and even captain? How does he decide to betray her despite their steamy relationship? Is he conflicted about it at all? How is it the first time they see each other after their combat at the end of the movie? I'd love to hear about how she gets back at him - she was pretty naive during the movie, which, of course, but I'd love to see her wise up and beat Hook at his own game.\n\nIf you want to go to a steamy place, I am very fine with that. You can deal with the size thing however you want - magically make one the other's size, have Zarina disappear in his clothes while he's working with the crew, just handwave the whole thing completely, whatever.

What COULD have happened?\n\nIn one of my favorite - and most entertaining - openings to date, Kady breaks up with Ezra just in time for the world as they know it to be blown to smithereens. What I want to know is HOW DID THEY GET TO THAT POINT? How did they get together? How did they fall in love? More details on Ezra’s struggle to NOT tell Kady the secret of his mother &amp; Kady’s frustration with Ezra’s reticence would be fantastic. There are hints throughout ILLUMINAE that stirrings of BeiTech’s machinations against the UTA were already running through the universe pre-the events of the book, so bonus points if those details are foreshadowed or discussed amongst the characters.\n\nBouncing from there, Kady &amp; Ezra spent most - if not all - of ILLUMINAE on either separate ships or out of contact. I would love to see more missing scenes of their day to day lives &amp; thoughts on the other a la Ezra’s drunken/desperate emails at the start of the book and Kady’s secret journal log. Were there more drafts Ezra never sent? Discussions he had with teammates while training? Discussions of Ezra between Kady and her fellow hacker? How far back did AIDAN’s investigation, by the way, into their relationship go? What thoughts of AIDAN, if any, did we not see? Did AIDAN know Ezra had survived? AIDAN is, again, not a mandatory inclusion, but I do find his relationship with Kady, and his fascination with her and Ezra, ever so interesting.\n\nSpeaking of Ezra surviving, I would definitely love to know what he was doing while Kady was off on her death mission - what are his thoughts when he realizes she had left the ship? When did he realize WHERE she had gone? How did he spend his time until he discovered she had survived? Was he busy writing unread (or AIDAN read) emails of his own?\n\nWhile Hanna &amp; Nik are not mandatory to include, I would also definitely love to see fic exploring the aftermath of both ILLUMINAE/GEMINAE and the sending of the ILLUMINAE files. When exactly did Ezra, Kady, Hanna, &amp; Nik start putting together the ILLUMINAE dossier to send to Executive Director Frobisher? While still on the Hypatia &amp; before they’d encountered Heimdall? Or on their way to Kerenza (or even after)? What is the dynamic between Ezra, Kady, Hanna, &amp; Nik? How much of a role did AIDAN play in the making of the files and how involved is he in Kady and Ezra’s machinations now? Speaking of AIDAN, while he is by no means a necessary inclusion, how does he feel about Ezra &amp; Kady’s relationship once reunited? What kind of relationship do Ezra and him have? Honestly, I’d even just love fic of the team recuperating and hanging out on Hypatia as they all get to know each other.\n\nAlternatively, I need about 1 million more words speculating the aftermath of GEMINA in Universe B. Or the events during GEMINA in Universe B. Or the events of ILLUMINAE in Universe B. Pick your poison, really, but I am fascinated by Universe B - or the possible Universes C, D, and E that could exist beyond. Seriously, feel free to go wild here.

My most first suggestion, of course, is going to be a superhero AU (established superheroes, from fandoms I already love like Iron Man &amp; Arrow are great, as are original superheroes based off the Ghost), but I think spies, heists, thieves &amp; agents, etc. work here as well!

AU it, any style!\n\n<i>Shipping</i>: I only ship Anastasia/Dimitri, so while I’m obviously okay with you sticking with Gen if you do not, I do request that there be NO Anastasia/Dimitri/Gleb or Anastasia/Gleb pairings (the only exception is Gleb unrequitedly pining for Anya/Anastasia).\n\nYou can guess that if every lonely girl would hope she’s a princess, that would yes, including this one. My love for this movie is intense, so you can only imagine the excitement in my theatre-girl loving heart when it was finally adopted into a real Broadway musical! And while the team, cast, &amp; crew did absolutely amazing things with this childhood classic, there is definitely a lot of fic to be had with what wasn’t there.\n\nTo start, while I understood the practical reasons for changing Anya &amp; Dimitri’s backstory, my romance-loving heart was more than a little upset at the downplaying of their enemies-to-lovers/childhood crushes romance. I would love more scenes of their perhaps less antagonistic, but no less fire-y relationship as Anya “Learn[ed] to Do It” or while the gang traveled from Russia to Paris during the “Traveling Sequence.” Similarly, while Ramin did his best, I was hoping for a more menacing and/or layered villain re: Gleb, so any scenes to fill that gap would be very welcome. For example, I desperately wanted Dimitri &amp; Vlad to be more aware of the threat GIeb posed to Anya’s life, so more scenes or indications of him actually posing a threat would be great.  It’s also implied that Gleb, rather than Dimitri, knew Anya when they were children, so I’d love to see more of the backstory there and a stronger understanding of his feelings for Anya in the present day. In essence, while I understood the reasons for many of the plot changes in the musical, I left feeling that too many questions re: the plot and character arcs were left unanswered/unsatisfied, so any fic that filled in those gaps would make me extremely happy.\n\nOn that same note, if you feel that the plot of the musical would be better served with some rewriting or what if scenarios, go for it! Give Gleb a completely new story arc - make him a guard from the palace turned Communist! Revive Dimitri &amp; Anya’s childhood friendship and throw childhood-rival Gleb in! What if Gleb had taken a shot at Anya at the ballet? What if Anya had been dancing in the ballet when she’d found Dimitri? What if Anya had stayed with her grandmother &amp; Dimitri had come back to her, instead of the other way around?\n\nI am also a true history nerd, so I have all the questions re: Anastasia &amp; Dimitri’s lives post-musical. Where are Anastasia &amp; Dimitri when the stirrings of WWII/Nazi Germany begins? What are Maria &amp; Anastasia’s discussions like re: the potential fallout/benefits of the return of the Russian monarchy - does Anastasia feel her people would be better or worse without her, as tales from communist Russia continue to spread? Do they stay in Paris permanently? Do they travel? Go to America? Visit her relatives in every country in Europe? I’m also here for Anastasia &amp; Dimitri, WWII spies, just to throw that out here.\n\nJumping off, this is obviously a story ripe with AU potential and I would love to see it retold in any which universe. Contemporary mob AU! Space AU! Magical monarchies AU! Steampunk AU! Ballet royalty AU (The Ballet Sequence is 100% one of my favorite new bits in the show)! Mix &amp; match with any of my favorite fandoms (Lunar Chronicles AU, I’m thinking would be great fun)!

Gimme Emily as the White House Chief of Staff, dealing with newcomers who think she’s a traitor. Or Emily as Alex’s Chief of Staff! I am here for the ladies, basically. Including Hannah as her badass self would obviously be delightful as well. \n\n**I will be watching season 2 of DESIGNATED SURVIVOR as it airs and may add a prompt or two as we go, but please do not feel obligated to keep up with the episodes or take notice of additional prompts if you have already started writing or have ideas!**\n\nLetter: http://mystarsandmyocean.tumblr.com/post/166167808225/yuletide-letter-2017\n\n\n"

(Btw, I'm not done with Ljusets Rike - I'm somewhere past half-way - but I know the basics, so I'm fine with a few hints if you must. Though I'd prefer Isfolket time line.) \n\nTargenor: I'm on my reread number I don't even know anymore, and I'm currently reading about Heike. He and his Wanderer friend are so special. ♥ I'd take anything with him, really. Go back to the time he still lived. How was it like? Or tell me about Heike's childhood and how they bonded with Targenor. What was it like for him before they met and his only connection to people were the locals who were afraid of him? Or go with the, uh, afterlife/not quite our world and give me a glimpse of how he's with the others there.\n\nTova Brink: Ah, how I relate to her and feel for her. I relate to her struggle with her self-image and self-esteem, and the worry that there's no one out there for her. I'd love to read anything, just like with the others. Any time of her life, from childhood to post-books, with anyone. And her sort of platonic flirting with Marco, aww. :D\n\nOr if there's a story you've wanted to write, even when it doesn't quite fit what I've mentioned here, do that one!\n\nLetter: http://mimm.dreamwidth.org/3086.html\n\n\n"
