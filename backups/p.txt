Tanaka Asuka, Nakaseko Kaori, Ogasawara Haruka

i've just really, really wanted ot3 fic for the third years for a really long time!! anything you wanted to write where they're together or getting together would be gold for me. if you want something more specific, i'm really fascinated by the way that asuka is extremely charismatic, but also very vulnerable, which she hides behind a really smooth mask. i'd really love to read something where maybe kaori and haruka are together, and think asuka wouldn't ever be interested in them, but secretly asuka is pining?

bonuses, always:
-secret pining
-future!fic
-outsider pov

-non-canon character death, major or minor

Arisugawa Juri

Would like to see Juri graduating and having some post-Otohri blues? That she realizes all the stuff that bothered her in high school don't impact her as much as she thought they did and even if she can't reshape the world she can reshape a life where she fits in?

Can I get Kyon having thoughts about his nickname? Since everyone including family and friends sort of go along with it, and he also goes by a number of other different aliases, does he just stop thinking about his original name (or forget it, and would that be Haruhi's doing)? Does he get bothered by this? If this request is too weird I'll just take some Kyon/Haruhi lol.

Fangirl - Rainbow Rowell 
Cath Avery, Wren Avery

How about some sort of discussion on exactly why Cath ships Simon and Baz? Or chooses to write about specifically M/M relationships? Over all the fanfic topics covered in the books (since, like, it was marketed towards normal people) I kinda felt that wasn't the one things they didn't go over. It isn't mentioned if she ships them because they have more chemistry than in her \"canon\" or if that's just what she finds attractive (Like, how does Cath feel about fujoshis?). No smut unless it's like...plot relevant? And canon ships only.

Wilde Life (Webcomic) 

My fave webcomic at the moment. So few fics for this I'll be happy with any of the characters just playing out a situation within the universe, whether it be another supernatural event or just two characters talking to or interacting with one another. No smut or non-canon shippings please. I'm not good with violence unless it serves a purpose in the plot, since I know it happens within the series.

Kageyama \"Mob\" Shigeo, Reigen Arataka

Do Want: Focus on Reigen and Mob's relationship. Canon compliant is more than fine, but I also do enjoy AUs (and I really enjoy age swap/role swap too). I really like plotty stuff.

DNW: ReiMob romance. Reigen gains psychic powers in any permanent capacity. Major character death.  Explicit sexual content. Sexual assault, whether referenced or explicit.

Totally Fine: Canon typical levels of violence. Inclusion of any canon characters. Background ships for either character (I really like Reigen with Serizawa, Dimple, or Shinra and Mob with Teru). Background ships for other characters (Ritsu/Shou? Tome/Mezato? Cool cool). I'm caught up on the manga so don't worry about spoilers.

Batwoman (Comic) 
Renee Montoya (Batwoman), Kate Kane (Batwoman)

Do Want: I would love something Renee-heavy that includes her ever-fraught relationship with Kate. They can be together romantically, broken up, in a version of events/universe where they never got together in the first place, dating other people (I like Maggie just fine, I've always had a soft spot for Dee, and Renee/Helena is always enjoyable), however you want to play it. Canon compliant is more than fine, but I also do enjoy AUs. I really like plotty stuff. Most of my DC reading is pre-New 52 (I followed Renee from Gotham Central up until the reboot pretty exhaustively and read most of Kate's stuff from 52 onward up until the reboot as well). That being said, given the nature of comics, I'm not super fussy about timelines and whatnot, I'm just here for the characters.

DNW: Sexual assault, whether referenced or explicit. Major character death.

Totally Fine: Canon typical levels of violence. Inclusion of any canon characters.

Claudia Seferius Mysteries - Marilyn Todd 
Claudia Seferius, Marcus Cornelius Orbilio

A short mystery for Claudia and Marcus to solve would be awesome, but equally I'd enjoy a glimpse into a larger investigation, or a vignette, Marcus navel-gazing, Claudia in her courtyard talking to Drusilla... 

Prompts: 
- Claudia adopts Drusilla (or vice versa, you can never tell with cats) early in her life. Tell me more about those days, when Claudia was a dancer. 
- Her time as a bride in Rome and how she did or did not curb her reckless streak.
- A five-times fic where Marcus and Claudia keep meeting in places they shouldn't, and the one time they meet where they should.
- Marcus, envious of Drusilla's devotion to Claudia, decides to get a pet of his own - a pet that will impress Claudia when she sees it.
- Marcus' looks back on his family's expectations for him, including his disastrous marriage.
- Under Augustan law, Claudia must remarry. Ignoring the ending of the series, what if she decided to contract a fake marriage with Marcus? Would she go through with it, would she run away again, would she finally admit her feelings?

In terms of Likes and DNWs, anything goes as long as it's canon-compliant in setting and tone.

- Guido and Paola discuss their favourite books - Classical literature and Henry James.

They're surprised and delighted by it, but they never lose sight of their grasp on power.

Prompts:
- I'm interested in Justinian's POV, since we only get glimpses of it in the books: His perspective on their first encounters, his feelings when Theodora takes a lover, how he balances love and duty.
- Theodora shows Justinian 'her' city - in disguise.
- A day at the races, with Theodora's divided loyalties to Blues and Greens possibly put to the test.
- Theodora and Justinian deal with palace intrigue(s) in their own individual ways, then discuss the consequences.

Cornetto \"40 - love\" Commercial 

DNWs
- Non-canonical (permanent) character death
- Anything that requires an adult rating (aside from language, if it's appropriate to the canon)
- Bodily fluids (unless it's for laughs)
- Any relationships not mentioned below
- AUs that change the setting
- For shippy things: power imbalance

I asked for this last year and got a great fic, which has just whet my appetite for more. And you can't have too much of a good thing.

What I love most about these two is the tennis, so something with tennis in it would be good (bonus points for including wheelchair tennis). Does Debbie play any tennis? Maybe Maria tries coaching her. Or outside of tennis, I'd like to see what Debbie's good at and whether Maria tries her hand at one of Debbie's hobbies.

I also love their relationship. I've like to see a moment that shows us what one of them likes about the other (aside from their shared experiences with fame and love of tennis). How hard is it to have a relationship with a well-known tennis player? How much publicity does Debbie end up with for dating a famous tennis player and how much does she hate it? How does Maria fit Debbie in around the tour?

Or I'd be just as happy receiving something with only one of these characters. What was Maria's life like before we meet her? How much respect did she actually get for being a tennis player and how much for her looks? What happened to make her serve go so terrible? How did she feel being a gay sportsperson when there aren't many that come out before they retire? Does her father come round to her friendship and relationship with Debbie?

What was Debbie's life like before we meet her? How did she get into lines umpiring? Did she play any tennis as a child? Does she have any desire to do line judging full time/become an umpire? Had she met any other tennis players off court before? What's her day job like? What do her friends and family think of her lines umpiring - do they get excited when they see her on TV at the tournament? What do her friends and family think about her relationship with Maria?

For this prompt I'd rather no real people appear in it. They can be mentioned, or use some of the characteristics of the real players, but I'd rather the tennis world here is slightly removed from the real world. And I'd rather no drugs/failed drug tests either.

- Bodily fluids (unless it's for laughs)
- Any relationships not mentioned below
- AUs that change the setting
- For shippy things: power imbalance

I love this show for the irreverent humour, the making sense of the news and the jokes. But mostly for the friendship (with frequent teasing) between Adam, Josh and Alex. I love the times when they've done sports: whether it's racing each other, being terrible at disability sports or just scaling them down to fit in the studio. The Josh and Alex shipping (with Alex and Carrie Fisher shipping on the side). I like that Josh wrote Adam/Alex fan fiction when they had their handwriting analysed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CS-nuAAasg).

I didn't request any characters for this because I'd be happy to see any of them in any combination. Maybe they compete at some more sports or write (more) fanfiction about each other. Maybe they invent a new sport that only they are good at and try it get it included in the Paralympics. We know Adam went to the Para-Athletics, but did Josh or Alex? Since Adam beat Jonnie over 1km at Superhero Tri, maybe they train for a 1km race and see who wins this time. Maybe Josh and Alex get involved in that, but in an inventive way that means they don't have to run 1km. How about if Adam was ill and couldn't do the show? Who would take his place? How much would Josh and Alex be sympathetic and how much would they tease him?

I also ship Josh/Jonnie (and like them as friends too). I like Jonnie's hair and how he's the nicest man in the world, and funny too. And keeps touching Josh's arse. I love how much fun they had with Josh's crush over the Paralympics and in The Crystal Maze and the reminder of it on the second Para-athletics special. What really happened in Rio that stayed in Rio (beyond what we saw on the show)? Since Josh has got his hair done like Jonnie's twice now, maybe Jonnie gets his done like Josh. What about Josh's other bromances or Alex's revelation that it was just a Showmance, like on Celebrity Big Brother? You could include Jonnie's time on Strictly - and since Jonnie was upset he didn't get to dance with Josh on the show, how about him getting that dance?

He's not nominated, but I also loved Liam Malone on the show, if you wanted to include him. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the rivalry between him and Jonnie - maybe they're given more tasks to compete at. Or just Liam's humour or love of photos of himself - maybe he or Jonnie (or both!) do that billboard of them in their underwear. Maybe they rope Adam/Josh/Alex in to do a billboard too.

Taskmaster (TV)

- Bodily fluids (unless it's for laughs)
- Any relationships not mentioned below
- AUs that change the setting
- For shippy things: power imbalance

I love this show because it's so funny. I cried with laughter when Noel, Joe and Lolly did the team bath task. And when the contestants were all collecting tears in series 1. I like how inventive the tasks are and how inventive the comedians are at solving them. But especially, just how terrible they can be at failing them. I like how Greg doesn't hold back when he thinks someone's solution or prize is terrible. And how he and Alex are always touching and joking about what Alex is allowed to do at home.

I didn't request any characters for this because I don't mind which comedian you have in here. It could be someone who's been on any of the series (whether nominated or not) or any other comedian that you think would be good on it (don't worry about whether or not I might have heard of them - if I haven't I'll be excited to discover a new one). Or just Greg and/or Alex.

I'd like to see something like the show, with tasks, banter, lateral thinking, reading between the lines of a task or just bringing in terrible items for the prize task. You could write one of the tasks we've already seen, but with different comedians. Or go with a new task. Or have any of them repeat a task, see if they've found a way to do it better this time. Have a later series do a task that was done in the previous series - see who's been paying attention to what came before them.

Or change the teams - how would a team task go with different people in the team (who weren't necessarily in the same series)? Or cross it over with The Crystal Maze - how would some of them get on with those sorts of challenges? How would they do at helping each other? Or stick them all in an Escape Room and see if they manage to escape. Or how about having Alex and/or Greg do a task?

Given this clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1lxtOyEFo) how about a task where they're given a pig and have to put some pig urine into a car's petrol tank?

Or for something completely different, just showing some of that home life in the Taskmaster house that Greg and Alex joke about.

Nero Wolfe - Rex Stout 
Nero Wolfe (Nero Wolfe - Stout), Archie Goodwin (Nero Wolfe - Stout)

This is my most faithful fandom, which makes me happy to receive stories of all sorts. Poetic takes, pre- or post- canon stories, case fics, alternate universes that put them in different cultural contexts or unusual settings in between-the-wars New York: I love them all. I'm happiest with stories that capture both the push-and-pull snark and the deep loyalty and affection between Wolfe and Archie. I'm also a slasher here but don't require that from others; I like reading about other members of their found family, too. The only possibilities I would find off-putting is treachery between the main characters or very cruel and unethical behavior by the protagonists -- neither fun for me nor canonical i.m.o. -- or character bashing, most especially including Lily Rowen. But, really, I'm fairly easy to make happy here with bonus points for historicity, extra plot, or banter.

Oz - L. Frank Baum 
Dorothy Gale (Oz - Baum), Princess Ozma (Oz - Baum)

I love the world-building in Oz as well as the relations between characters. It seems a shame that Ozma, as a good ruler, doesn't get as many chances in the later books to enjoy the odder bits of her nation and continent as she did when she was Tip.  I'd love circumstances to pitch her into some sort of adventure with Dorothy where they could experience an unknown or secret aspect of any place ranging from the nations beyond the deadly deserts to an undiscovered aspect of the Emerald City itself. I'd also enjoy reading more about Ozma and Dorothy's relationship, something that fell anywhere on the spectrum between romantic friendship through femslash. And other canon characters showing up would be a nice bonus. Again, I'm not really big on evil or corrupt versions of these characters although I certainly wouldn't argue against reflection, melancholy or angst. But it is Oz, after all, so I believe color, humor, and happy resolutions often work really well in this fandom.

Singin' in the Rain (1952) 
Cosmo Brown, Don Lockwood, Kathy Selden

Golden Age Hollywood! Three-way romance!  Screwball humor veiling some acute social commentary! Getting on with your private life when it demands getting away with something to be happy! These three are pretty much the trio of my heart, and I love their being at the least all very close friends, but I think there are quite a few possibilities to explore in the way of plots. What about the trip back to someone's home town? The exotic resort vacation (Avalon, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara?) The collision or collusion with another of the stars shown at the silent movie premier at the beginning of the movie?  The you're-casting-us-in-what movie production at the studio? Them solving a mystery together?  Or Cosmo finally writing that symphony with shenanigans ensuing?  Again, I'd prefer no treachery or terribly dark version of the characters -- it's just not the year for that for me -- but I'd especially love anything capturing the atmosphere, the characters, and the goofy but to-the-point humor of the original musical.

Elisandra Halsing, Kent Ouvrelet, Roderick (Castle Auburn)

<b>Prompts</b>: I would love to know more about Elisandra and Roderick falling in love, including what drew them together despite their different circumstances and the extreme danger. I'd also love a look at the night before Elisandra's wedding--the desperation and comfort that they must have shared. Or what pushed Roderick to stay at the castle. 

For Corie and Kent, I'd love to see Kent's side of the relationship or how Corie and Kent navigate their lives after the events of the wedding. Are there people who try and almost succeed at coming between them?

The Queen's Thief - Megan Whalen Turner 
Attolia (Queen's Thief), Eugenides (Queen's Thief)

<b>Prompts</b>: I'd love to see some hurt/comfort for Eugenides and Attolia. Especially if there's arguing and guilt--maybe either Eugenides or Attolia gets kidnapped after they've fought and the other has to mount a rescue (while dealing with their regret and guilt). 

I'd also love to know more about Eugenides's thought process during <i>The Queen of Attolia</i> when he decided that he was going to propose to Attolia.  Or what happened during their wedding night?

Eugenides and Attolia in a different setting would be very interesting, either in canon or in a modern royalty AU. Maybe they find themselves in a hostile place, cut off from their allies and have to work together to get to safety (either pre-getting together or after) or Attolia is a modern day queen and Eugenides steals her reluctant heart!

The two of them going out to a fancy gala and Sabrina charming everyone (or distinctly not charming everyone). Linus and Sabrina navigating a relationship with the Larrabees.

I'm also really interested in seeing a look at the two of them dealing with a problem behind closed doors--how do they handle someone snubbing Sabrina in polite society or Linus feeling like he's not able to protect Sabrina? I'd love to see one of them comforting the other when something goes bad--maybe Linus is stoic, but Sabrina knows that he needs someone to lean on, or Sabrina reaches her limit and Linus whisks her away and lets her cry on his shoulder.

Emily Marshwic, Daffed Mallen, Cristan Northway

How does Emily adjust (or not adjust)? They also will likely have to deal with confusion and censure over their relationship--how do they support each other when there are issues in public?

I'd also love to know what happens to Mallen. Does he find the Denland woman that he was in love with now that the war is over? Do he and Emily reconnect at any point in the future? I feel like they had a very interesting connection and a deep respect for each other that could play out as platonically or romantically. 

I also loved the Survivor's Club and would be very happy to see them meet up down the line. Where do they all end up and what brings them all together again?

I'm also super into Aydis/Freya. Does Freya keep an eye on Aydis' journey? When Freya gives Aydis that goodbye kiss, do Freya and Aydis both think that there could be something more? I'd love to see the tables being turned on Freya for once with respect to love.

I love the tragic Brynhild/Sigurd relationship. They both will live forever but they're unable to be together--does this current quest actually mean that if they defeat Odin, they have a chance to be together?

But even more than that, I'd love a fic where they end up unequivocally together. You know, a fic that doesn't have an ambiguous/sad ending.

Wolf 359 (Radio) 
Hera (Wolf 359), Doug Eiffel (Wolf 359), Daniel Jacobi (Wolf 359)

Wolf 359 is currently, for my money, one of the best shows in any medium for explorations of loyalty and betrayal and failure and consciousness, so a story in this fandom that looks at those sorts of themes will warm the cockles of my heart. While I picked my favorite characters, I don’t need a story that features all three; any combination will do. Jacobi’s undying devotion to Maxwell delights me, and makes me wonder what bonded two otherwise fairly amoral, ruthless people together so strongly. Hera’s complicated relationship with Maxwell, her liberator and her captor all at once, fascinates me, as does the question of whether Maxwell left any ghosts in her machine, either metaphorical or literal. I love my pacifist addict bad-decision son Douglas Eiffel almost as much as I love seeing him suffer, and a story related to the Dear Listeners and him would not go amiss. Hera and Eiffel’s friendship and teamwork and hard-earned consideration for each other makes me happy, and I have been known to be trash for Hera/Eiffel. Or you could go for the curveball! Have Eiffel and Jacobi square off over a decision of moral relativism! Make Jacobi and Hera team up to take on command! I’m not kidding when I say I’m open to possibilities; go nuts.

Sagas of Sundry: Dread (Web Series) 

I love the tense, snarling, fucked-up feel of this show, the way none of the characters can ever communicate honestly, or have an easy trust, and there’s no better trio for that dynamic than Sat, Kayden, and Tanner. I was fascinated when I watched this series by Sat’s conviction that if they could only lay the evil to rest, Tanner would be saved; I would really like a story that deals with the fallout of that conviction. What if Tanner really does come back? What if he comes back… not quite himself? What if he didn’t really want to come back? What if he comes back and still hates Kayden? What if he comes back and still loves Sat? What if he comes back, but only after a long, difficult journey, to find that Kayden and Sat had moved on? What if Sat’s wrong, and Tanner really is just dead forever? What if Kayden and Sat never move on? What if one of them does, but the other doesn’t? How do you go on and live your life after something like that? I like any combination of pairings among these three, including gen or a fucked-up threesome, but I would prefer it if they had to work for it, and not necessarily have things work out the way they’d hope.

One of the changes the production team for American Gods made that I appreciated the most was expanding the character of Laura Moon and sending her on a road trip with Mad Sweeney. Their guilt-riddled, selfish tour across America was one of my favorite parts of Season One, and I would love a closer look at it, or anything that explores that relationship more. Either het or gen is okay, but I would appreciate it if Shadow didn't get bad-mouthed too badly.

Sunless Sea 
The Presbyterate Adventuress, The Tireless Mechanic (Sunless Sea)

I'm okay with a story that just includes one but not both of these characters. For the Adventuress, I'm interested in how she deals with her impending death, and those years she spent trying to run from the people trying to kill her (and letting other people die for her). Anything about what happened the night before her death (for any of the player options) would be great. I'd also love to read anything about the incredibly enigmatic Presbyterate, about her travels, or about her relationship with the Brisk Campaigner. For the Mechanic, I'd love to read any story where he works on the engine or builds/fixes things (possibly while working together with Maybe's Daughter). I'd also like to know more about how he stole the secret from the Bazaar. How did the Fingerkings find him in the first place? What's it like to gaze into the dreams of the Stone Pigs?

I'd love to read anything related to what it's like for Anaander Mianaai to be a single mind distributed across thousands of bodies that is thousands of years old, and what it feels like to have one's mind start to split apart. I'd also be interested in the early history of her rule: how Anaander consolidated power, how she began the process of cloning herself and existing continuously, what the civil wars with the Notai were like, and so on. Another thing I've wondered about is the motivations of the Anaander who appointed Breq as Fleet Captain: Is she attempting to play the long game in some way? Finally, I'd love to see Anaander interacting with the Presger translators (or interacting with other aliens, or non-Radchaai leaders, for that matter). (More details in my letter.)

I'd be interested in something set pre-canon—was the Countess ever naive about what her marriage would be like? Were there other occasions where the Countess had to shield her servants from her husband's advances? I'd also love to see them plotting to solve some problem on another occasion, possibly with Figaro, Cherubino, or Barbarina involved. Also, please definitely feel free to write shipfic about them.

Copenhagen - Frayn 
Niels Bohr (Copenhagen), Werner Heisenberg (Copenhagen)

I like how this play deals with the slipperiness of history and memory, and the ways in which people deceive themselves. I'm also interested in the weird, complicated relationship between Bohr and Heisenberg, where they're mentor and protege but also friends but also father and son to each other (and I'd also be happy to read shipfic, though I can't see a happy ending for them). A fic set in any time period in the long time they've known each other is fine with me (including, as in the play, when they're \"dead and gone\"). Something set during the discovery of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, when Heisenberg was an upstart, would be interesting, especially since in the play we only see the version filtered through 20 years of memory and turmoil. Appearances from other scientists, politicians, and institutions would be welcome as well. I'd also be interested in reading something from Margrethe's perspective, given how critical of Heisenberg and how perceptive she is. (More details in my letter.)

Imperial Radch Series - Ann Leckie 
Justice of Toren One Esk Nineteen | Breq, Seivarden Vendaai

I just reread <em>Ancillary Justice</em> and was struck by how quickly we sped through that year between Nilt and the arrival at Omaugh Palace. Clearly a lot happened in that time, even if it was only character development. I'd love to see an episode set in that period--Seivarden and Breq getting used to one another as traveling companions, having harrowing adventures Breq doesn't bother to mention in the book because they're irrelevant to her revenge arc, interacting with humans, AIs, and aliens in and outside Radch space, any of it.

If you'd rather focus on later events, I'd love to hear about anything related to the Conclave.

Or generally--hurt/comfort, worldbuilding, pining, adventures, I'm down for it all in this fandom! Happy for gen, Breq/Seivarden, or Mercy of Kalr/Breq/Seivarden.

This was such a lovely story. Beautiful prose--I loved the contrast in styles between the normal narration and each woman telling her story. I appreciated how the two of them worked together to solve their problems, and the anger each of them felt on the other's behalf. 

I'd love to see something set post-canon. Do they wander together after leaving the mountain, in and out of other fairytales? Does either of them return home? I would love Tabitha/Amira. If you go that route, doe the romantic relationship come come easily after the time they've spent together, or does it take a while to develop? I'd much prefer a happy ending, though bittersweetness along the way is more than fine.

I had such fun reading this story in all its tropey goodness, and I'd love to see more of it! Bel was wonderful, and I enjoyed the few glimpses of Ressid that we got. They're both terrifyingly competent. How would they play off each other--maybe post-canon events, dealing with the diplomatic and social fallout on Iskat &amp; Thean relations? I'd also adore canon divergence in this story. Bel and Ressid somehow wind up interacting early on and untangle the situation together? Ressid is the one who makes the political marriage, and Bel is assigned as her aide?

If you enjoy worldbuilding, adventure, diplomacy, or twisty plots, please have at it!

I ship Jainan/Kiem--feel free to include as much of it as you'd like--and am tickled by the idea of Bel/Ressid, though I'd also enjoy Bel &amp; Ressid.

Do wants: Female POV, mentorship, In the wintertime, when the farm is fallow, Sheeta goes with Dola and her gang to learn a new trade and leadership, but minus the icky “ooh a girl” parts, please. 

Learning how to fly! The feeling of flight and freedom is a big one for me in terms of enjoyment. I really liked the small parts of the movie where Sheeta and Pazu learned things about each other's lives, or were just smart and competent in general, but Pazu doesn't have to be in the fic. Negotiating with other powers in the sky, buying things, exploring new places, having adventures, aftermath of their first adventure, I like all of these things.

Wonder Woman (2017) 

DNWs: Bodily fluids described in loving detail (please, please don’t): Blood, spit, semen, lube, etc are really not something I want to hear about much. Mentioning them is fine, just please don't linger.

Maiming/involuntary loss of limbs.

Infidelity or cheating of any sort.

Male/female incest, including parent/child (any gender) incest and heavy child abuse (shota and loli).

Slash including canon old men, at least one of whom is evil (ex. Dumbledore/Voldemort, Mr. Raines/Mr. Parker).

Do wants: Themyscira! Life there. Show me the love, the passion, the ridiculously epic showboating they do in “training”. Show me their culture, how they study the world, what they do for food and/or how they amuse themselves.

During the war, I'd love to see Diana talking/working with more women, that kind of thing.

Alternately, Steve didn't die, and the aftermath of that. I'd love to see the team (including Etta Candy) break apart/stay together as the world recovers from war. Visiting everybody's families! Diana's wonder at the world! I totally want her to snuggle a baby. 

Feel free to look at a single character, their viewpoint in the above, POC encouraged.

Finally, Wonder Woman being a pro-femdom, bondage-friendly kind of space originally, I am all for some lovely power play between Diana and...anyone really, tbh. I see Diana as a very assured, mostly gentle kind of domme, with a large playful side. I like Diana/Steve, but Diana/Etta, Diana learning about power play on Themyscira, Diana teasing/impressing/helping any of the team out with her ability to lead and comfort in a more personal manner (I'm totally thinking of Sameer for those first two), I am for these things.

Princess Bride (1987) 
Westley (Princess Bride), Count Tyrone Rugen

DNWs: Bodily fluids described in loving detail (please, please don’t): Blood, spit, semen, lube, etc are really not something I want to hear about much. Mentioning them is fine, just please don't linger.

Maiming/involuntary loss of limbs.

Infidelity or cheating of any sort.

Male/female incest, including parent/child (any gender) incest and heavy child abuse (shota and loli).

Slash including canon old men, at least one of whom is evil (ex. Dumbledore/Voldemort, Mr. Raines/Mr. Parker).

Do wants: This is embarrassing to admit, despite having been a solidly pervy person who knows she likes these things for at least a decade now, but oh man, that torture scene in the Princess Bride. So beautifully evil. Count Rugen being so calm and collected, Westley just suffering and not being able to hold back his tears. It being an experiment/for posterity! That is totally a kink for me. 

So...a slightly different kind of fairytale, where our famed torturer Count Rugen doesn't necessarily \"kill\" Westley, but gets to keep him, and experiment more, and explain exactly what he's doing to him. You're perfectly welcome to make it a delayed rescue, hurt-comfort (with Rugen or Westley's rescuers being the comforters), or a recovery fic. 

I also adore the dialogue in the movie (who doesn't), so Westley being clever when he's not suffering is a lovely idea. If you wanted to skip the torture entirely and have Westley being fluffy with someone and just exchange quips, or small bits of heartfelt dialogue, then I'd be happy to read that too!

Thinking Sideways (Podcast) RPF 
Devin (Thinking Sideways RPF), Steve (Thinking Sideways RPF), Joe (Thinking Sideways RPF)

Some prompts:

- Cryptids! The whole TSP crew loves camping and the outdoors. All kinds of weird stuff happens in the woods. How about some big foot encounters, thunderbirds, ogopogos, or even good ol' Chupy? Or how about some Journey to the Centre of the Earth-style spelunking for forgotten dinosaurs?

- Urban Legends/Creepypasta! Black-Eyed Kids; hook handed maniacs, axe wielding serial killers, THE PHONE CALL CAME FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE. How would the scooby gang fare?

- Lost treasures! Do they get sent a map by an anonymous listener? Or do they stumble on it themselves somehow (maybe one of Devin's reddit rabbitholes)? What about exploring an abandoned mine that leads to untold riches? Or deciphering clues that gets the illuminati on their tail?

- Ghost ships! Yeah, yeah, Devin says she's never getting on a cruise ship again but... Or what if Joe's dreams of sailing around in a little boat come true? Sea monsters, river monsters, boats abandoned with meals still warm on the table, lighthouses in the fog where no lighthouses should be...

- TSP goes international! You know that grant money they're always joking about getting to walk around places IRL instead of doing it on googlemaps? What if they did get some money and decide to tackle an international mystery? TSP vs the Dyatlov Pass! TSP vs Mokele-Mbembe! TSP vs the Island of the Dolls!

DNW: shipfic, rape, major character death, spouses/fiances featuring in the story, aliens, mothman, LCQP, more than one cryptid in the story unless it's a parody or comedy fic (I love most cryptids but I can't suspend disbelief far enough that someone would encounter a Hopkinsville Goblin and a Mongolian Death Worm and a Bunyip etc all in one story)

Noel Fielding (British Comedy RPF), Lee Mack (British Comedy RPF)

I'm mostly charmed by the fact that two people with such different comedy styles can be so entertained by each other. They always look like they're having so much fun when they're on panel shows together and always manage to get such genuine laughs out of each other! I ship them but friendship fic would be just as great!

Some prompts:

- Edinburgh back in the day, sharing a flat, shows every night, working hard, stressed out, drinking together, blowing off steam, staying up all night watching horror movies, teasing Lee about his abysmal lack of musical knowledge, teasing Noel about his dress sense

- Present day, spending time together behind the scenes at panel shows, finding time to still hang out and get up to mischief, old friends/old lovers reconnect

- Panel show shenanigans: Noel on WILTY, revealing embarrassing or hilarious antics he and Lee have got up to (NOT outing Lee or that they're dating or anything like that); Noel on Duck Quacks Don't Echo (again) getting roped into doing some hilarious, scientifically questionable experiment with Lee; Lee on Task Master, calling in veteran Noel for help with a task... the rules didn't say they couldn't have outside help!; Lee on celebrity Bake Off being hassled by Noel while he tries to make profiteroles...

Nikita (TV 2010) 
Alexandra Udinov, Seymour Birkhoff (Nikita 2010)

Some prompts:

- Ridiculous spy tropes! I've always wanted to read something set in S1 where Alex, for insert-plot-reasons-here, has to seduce Birkhoff inside Division, under Amanda's nose, possibly while Nikita tells her it's a bad idea but Alex does it anyway. Or the classic pretending to be together for a mission leads to actually getting together. 

- Hurt/comfort! I've always loved how Division does all its medical stuff in house. I love how they have the whole lab there full of dangerous equipment. I love that it seems like they're all trained in what to do. 

- I'd love something set on a mission where Alex and Birkhoff are cut off from the others and have to rely solely on each other to achieve their goal. 

- Psuedo-science and technobabble! I LOVE the junk science and tech they come up with on these kinds of shows. Tell me a story about the weird and wacky and scientifically impossible inventions Birkhoff comes up with and the ways Alex deploys them in the field to save the day.

DNW: rape, adultery, major character death, kids/pregnancy, bondage/people being held down during sex (other kink is fine)

Nation - Terry Pratchett 
Ermintrude \"Daphne\" Fanshaw, Mau (Nation)

I love Nation. I've requested it for many Yuletides and so far have not been a match on it. If I'm lucky enough to match this time I love how the process of survival brings them back to life. I also very much enjoyed the myths, and the imagery of the dolphins and the sother world that Daphne stepped into. Or in fact how they  went from the end of the action to the epilogue.
Pretty much anything would be fantastic, involving whatever you want!

Rivers of London - Ben Aaronovitch 

This is a series I discovered this year and promptly devoured in about three days and then went around recommending to everyone. I don't mind what the story is about - I like plot, I like the hilarious clash between modern policing and magic. I like the genuinely creepy stuff they find with the magic and how Peter is trying to get technology to work. Basically, I'm so delighted by the serious anything would be very welcome!

Monstrous Regiment - Terry Pratchett 

Anything Terry Pratchett is an automatic favourite for me, but I recently re-read Monstrous Regiment and it has a different feel to some of the other. I'd love to know what happened next for any of the characters. Was it only Polly who went back? Did she become a professional soldier. What then went on to happy with regards the Duchess and Wazzer? Basically I think there are a lot of stories that could carry on from where the novel finished.
Likewise, I also like a 'slice of life' if that is more your cup of tea of the squad together - that would also be amazing.


Request 4 by perryvic
Doctor Strange (2016) 

I enjoyed the film, though obviously they hop skipped and jumped over the training sections. It was a credit to Benedict Cumberbatch that there was any belief that the character had developed beyond self interest. I'd love to see  more of that - fill in the head canon gaps of Stephen Strange's transformation from arrogant egocentric to someone who could believably lock himself into a loop of eternally dying for the sake of the world. Or the disconnect between being as intelligent as he is mentally, but stunted emotionally ... anything really about him developing.

Nero Wolfe - Rex Stout 
Archie Goodwin (Nero Wolfe - Stout)

Gen is absolutely fab, or any pairing involving Archie (and I really do mean any pairing).

Some suggestions: What if Lily Rowan had to stay at the brownstone for a week and Archie had to play peacemaker between her, Wolfe and Fritz? What if Archie and Cramer had to go on a stake-out together - would they make it through the night? Why is Theodore never seen downstairs? I'd love to see Wolfe as the world's laziest vampire who cares about what Archie eats because he'll be able to taste it in Archie's blood. And, what with all the kisses they keep throwing in each other's directions, I would kill for some Archie/Fritz.

I also love Archie resisting interrogation. Whether it's Cramer, a goon with a gun or a seductive lady, I love how he plays along without giving anything away, so anything like that would be hugely welcome. Un-nominated characters are also very welcome.

God's Own Country (2017) 
Johnny Saxby, Gheorghe Ionescu

I'd really like anything set post-canon - apart from that I'm easy! I'd love to see how they make the farm work. Do Deirdre and Gheorghe come to an arrangement over the kitchen? What changes does Johnny have in mind? Do they meet up with Johnny's uni mates over Christmas? Are they still there running the farm in twenty years time? Do they get any time to explore Yorkshire together? Local place details would be amaaaaazing. 

My only DNWs for this fandom are homophobia and an unhappy ending. It was so refreshing to see a gay romance with a happy ending and no obvious homophobia from the people around them, I'd like to see fic in the same vein. I am very down for anything more serious/political about the farming industry and about the potential impact of Brexit on Gheorghe's immigration status, if that's something you're interested in exploring, but domestic fluff would make me exceedingly happy :)

My otp of all otps. I would love a fix-it happy ending for them, and/or a first time. Neutral pronouns for Estraven a MEGA bonus (exploration of Genly's gender identity a mega MEGA bonus!)

DNW: Genly to remain as misogynist by the end of the fic as he is in canon, noncon (I understand that kemmer lends itself to dubcon, but I'd prefer it not get uncomfortable), pining where they never get together, or uncritical acceptance of canon's proposal that Gethenian sex always involves one person growing a dick and the other a womb.

I also adore Khiruev, her backstory and her trauma and strength. And I like Cheris/Khiruev :)

Sex is great if you want to write it, but pining is great too. 

DNW: a maternal relationship of any kind between them. Romantic Kreia/Exile is what I'm here for.

Just wants to know the fate of the Jacksonville Jaguars!  Just wants to profess his love!

This can be a solo story, or include other characters (shippy or not) – I'd love to hear about her background, her schooldays, missing scenes from the TV episodes, ideas about her future, or even AUs.  If you want to make it gay with any other adult(s) then do your thing, but gen is brilliant too.  Specific fandom DNWs: major kinks, non/dub!con, child abuse.

The Bletchley Circle 

Tell me anything more about any of these characters!  Did Susan ever come back from India?  Did Millie get her government job back?  What was Jean's life like during the war?  How far up in the police force did Lucy make it?  And did Alice live happily ever after?  I'm a massive fan of all possible female romantic pairings in this fandom, and would also be more than happy with OT3/4/etc, but if that isn't your thing then don't worry – I'm equally invested in the characters individually, and I love them all.  Fandom-specific DNWs: major character death, non/dub!con.

I adore the relationship between these two &amp; the humour they've got going with each other.  Are they a couple or are they just friends?  Entirely up to you.  Give me casefic, or a quiet moment between cases, or missing scenes from the episodes – anything that focuses on the relationship between them.  Bonus points for gardening-related plots and puns.  Specific DNWs for this fandom: kink, major character death, het relationships.

The Nancy - Stan Rogers (Song) 
Captain Alexander MacIntosh

I've never done a five-minute fandom before, but this song's got under my skin for some reason and I would like fic. I think it's because I get such a strong sense of who Captain Alexander MacIntosh is from it, such a powerful personality comes across in his tone and voice as well as the words. I want a fic that shows me some more of his personality. He has a great deal to say about men in uniform, and if you want to play with that I would love to read it - anything from uniform kink with the elegant Captain Maxwell, to backstory about the handsome man with powdered hair and a red coat who cheated him in a game of cards. Or if you want to talk about his attitude to class, this proud nephew of the laird who so strongly identifies with poor ragged sailors. And for all he seems a bit of a pure aggressive military type, he's canny enough to stop and enquire before proceeding down the river, and has a light enough touch that he can find a friendly Wyandotte who will talk to him and give him the information he needs. 

I have to confess, I requested this partly because I misheard the lyrics the first time I listened to it. I thought that Captain Maxwell had begged to be put ashore, MacIntosh had ordered him below, and then fought to save them both. If you wanted to write this slightly AU version of the story for me, I would love that, whether you wanted to write the two captains afterwards (slash very welcome!), or describe the naval battle from Maxwell's point of view - Maxwell's point of view on the Nancy and her crew would be wonderful - or anything at all. Feel free to quietly ignore Captain Maxwell's wife and kids if that works better for you. 

I read up a little about what the Nancy was doing there and the historical setting, and if you want to use that, by all means do, I love historical stories and settings. But for this canon, if you want to transpose it to some other setting, go ahead. The Nancy would make a fine name for a spaceship... feel free to go wild with this, genderswap, aliens, AIs, sentient ships, other historical or fictional settings, crossovers and fusions - this is wide open, have fun!

Words cannot express how much I love Sgt Cawood. I know so many women like her IRL, but I almost never see them shown as heroines in stories. I love her in action, but I would happily read a thousand words of her doing laundry, if that's how your imagination takes you, or anything else you can think of. I love her relationship with Clare and how they look after each other, I love how she mentors younger women in the job, I love her and Ann working together, I love how compassionate she is in her work and also how tough. Really, anything you want to write about her, I want to read it.

The Laundry Files - Charles Stross 
James Angleton (The Laundry Files), Bob Howard

This is one of those book series I've been following for years. I liked the earlier, more pastiche-y and lighter books best, but I do also enjoy the darker and more apocalpytic later books too. Obviously requesting Angleton, that implies earlier series stuff, but if you want to interpret Angleton as Eater-of-Souls-Now-Inside-Bob then you can set it later if you prefer. Or resurrect him, if you can come up with a way, given that I don't think there was ever a body you can probably find a way to make that work, and I miss Angleton a lot in the later books, so I would love to see him return. But I do love the dynamic with young Bob and Angleton the scary mentor. Show me Angleton teaching Bob something, show me Bob snarking at Angleton and amusing him by not being too scared of him, show me them fighting tentacled incursions together, show me anything with these two interacting. If you're tempted to write slash, I can see it, in a deeply weird alien sort of way with Angleton enjoying the hell out of unsettling Bob and Bob enjoying surprising him, though I'd prefer if you set it when Bob's not together with Mo.

The Legend of Drizzt Series - R. A. Salvatore 
Drizzt Do'Urden, Zaknafein Do'Urden

I am a huge fan of the earlier books, Anything in the earlier days of R.A. Salvatore. If I had to guess where they lost me was around the Hunter’s Blade Trilogy. I Haven’t read anything past this as I have really lost the love for the writing of Salvatore! So this is more of a create your own adventure, feel free to re write the Mythology of the world and story if you need. 

I love Drizzt and Catti, even if it is a bit weird as he watched the girl grow up and then old. But at the same time I think it is sweet and adorable how much he can care for her. So feel free to use that pairing.

I also really enjoy the way Drizzt and Zaknafein interacted in the early books. I think it was a neat dynamic and would love to see a father and son interaction. Be it with a ghost of Zaknafein or be it while Drizzt was still in Menzoberranzan. 

Do you like to write AU’s? If so I would love a Modern Fantasy AU, where Drizzt is still a Drow, and the characters keep the race they were given in the story, but bring them to our world. What adventures and how would they interact in the world as it is now, with the high Fantasy of the books still a solid part of reality.

Princess Tutu 
Fakir (Princess Tutu), Ahiru | Duck, Rue (Princess Tutu), Mytho (Princess Tutu)

Is a very dear anime to me. It is one of the few I have fallen in love with in the Magical Girl Genera. And more so as it is one that my best friend introduced to me (she introduces me to lots but so many are boring to me this one caught my heart) . I might sound picky with this fandom but I am not. Honestly, I Swear to you!

I do want a Fakir and Ahiru Story. I love this couple and would love the story to feature and revolve around them. Mytho and Rue are my other couple but I am not as into them as Fakir and Ahiru!

I would like something with the characters older then they are now. This will allow you so many more options. Does she continue to be Tutu after the show, does she stay a duck, if so how does that effect Fakir? Did he move on to a new woman and care for Duck or does he let her go free!

I would love to see an after the story ends arc. But it is not the only thing you HAVE to do! Other things that would be cool to see... A date night (bonus points if he takes her to the circus), or an adventure to save another doomed person. Maybe an AU where they are actually in the Ballet and this is the story they are preparing to preform on stage. Lots you can do. I am happy with so much.

This is a story I grew up with in story books, movies, music, and when I got old enough the novel. One of the things I always wanted to be confirmed on did he die? Did Haggard Die in the collapse of his castle? Did The Unicorn come back to save him, with her being able to regret, could she handle the guilt of his death on her and the others. Does another save him, if so what or who? Please no porn for this fandom. I am not okay with thinking about Haggard and some other... no please no!

Murcielago (Manga) 
Kuroko Koumori, Hinako Tozakura

(You don't have to use all of my requested characters.)

As soon as I heard this manga's premise, I knew I'd love it, but I didn't realize just how much I'd love it. It's such a delightfully wacky mix of horror, comedic hijinks, and sex, and I adore every minute of it.

I love all the characters, and while I'm only requesting Kuroko and Hinako, I would also be happy with receiving any other characters from the series, included non-nominated ones, if you have ideas for them. I'm open to basically any ship as well as gen. Casefic for a weird new criminal of the week, PWP, porn with plot, fluff...I'm here for any of it.

Specific prompts:

* Kuroko/Hinako has sucked me in as a ship more than I ever thought it would. At first it was because I didn't realize the extent of the age difference, but even then, I've found myself not terribly minding it. (If you're interested but only if Hinako is aged up, feel free to go that route!)

Kuroko gets in over her head and it's Hinako to the rescue? Hinako gets sex-pollened by their latest criminal's scheme, and it's Kuroko, ahem, to the rescue? They have to pretend to be girlfriends to sneak into an event for an investigation?

* So, about Kuroko killing Hinako's parents for being \"bad people\"...I'm definitely interested in fic about Hinako's family and Kuroko's relationship with it.

* I ship Kuroko/Reiko something awful. I'd love to read about Kuroko trying to pry Reiko out of her shell, whether through awkward dates, vigorous sex, or both. (Also, uh, consider all the gunplay potential. Just consider it.)

* This is a bit of an out-there prompt, but I'm intrigued by the idea of Kuroko helping Rose Maria adapt to the outside world again in her own bizarre ways. After all, who better to help an outsider than another outsider?

DNWs: Crossovers, gender headcanons, pregnancy, focus on characters dying of old age, asexuality headcanons.

Bernhard Strauss, Tycho (Marathon), Tfear (Marathon), Durandal (Marathon)

(You don't have to use all of my requested characters.)

I love these games and their terrible AIs and their terrible humans and terrible aliens, all of them terrible in the best way possible. There's so much backstory and worldbuilding potential, and I'm interested in any and all of it, but I'm especially interested in the unique relationships between each of these characters. (Feel free to go either shippy or platonic!)

Specific prompts:

* My favorite thing about Tycho's weird bratty attitude is his bizarre secondhand daddy issues about Strauss. I'd love to see something with them interacting pre-canon. Does Tycho get suspicious about what Strauss and Durandal are up to, always being alone together?

* I love how dysfunctional and messed-up the \"working\" relationship is between Tfear and Tycho in Infinity. I'm so down to read something about how Tfear treated Tycho when he fell into the Pfhor's hands in the first place. Or, hell, when Tycho goes against him, he says he isn't relishing spending the next few decades in Tfear's jaws...but I'd relish reading about that. c;

* I'm also down for seeing something with Durandal and Tfear - what did they get up to while Durandal was \"dead?\"

* So, how about that AI incest? Because I don't know about you, but Tycho's obsession with Durandal crossed the line from \"pissed off brother\" to \"creepily invested yandere\" pretty quickly. Just give me all of Tycho's messed up familial issues, and/or an examination of how being reborn in Durandal's image has fucked with his sense of identity (and the way he views Durandal).

Hoji (Shadow Warrior), Enra (Shadow Warrior), Ameonna (Shadow Warrior), Lo Wang

This is a very recent addition to my list of canon loves, but boy, do I love it something awful. So delightfully earnest and wacky, while still having a surprising amount of emotion. (And ship potential. So much ship potential.)

While my prompts are shippy, feel free to go the platonic route with any of them!

Specific prompts:

* I'd love to read something about Hoji and Enra's relationship pre-canon. So much angst and manipulation and messy feelings, oh my. (I may, uh, have come out of the game shipping these two with the passion of a thousand suns, so feel free to go the fucked-up incest route as well.)

* Speaking of incest, I do love Hoji/Ameonna too. I'm certainly here for reading more about the process of their budding relationship, and Ameonna's feelings about everything going downhill.

* To round out the \"shipping Hoji with everyone\" triangle, the elephant in the room is that this game is basically The Adventures of Dorky Assassin Guy And His Sassy Demon Boyfriend. I am so here for anything with Hoji and Lo Wang - fluffy fix-it fic for the ending? Wacky demon/human cultural differences causing awkward situations? Come to think of it, how hard is it to jack off when the demon in your body is sassing you about it the whole time? Just...these two, man, I love them and want more of them.

I love this little slice of sweet revenge to utter pieces.  So we know generally what happens after the movie ends, but do the girls keep in touch?  Those epilogues don't say anything about it but I'd love something where they do so, either through the phone or via letter (and eventually email?).  

Deeper peeks into the characters would be lovely.  What of Violet's new marriage?  Judy's life as a corporate head and a mother?  Doralee's journey through the world of country music?

Carrie - Stephen King 
Carrie White, Susan Snell

My real desire when it comes to fic in this fandom is to see some kind of reconciliation between Carrie and Sue - whether it be spiritual or mental or anything like that.

I love the uncomfortable relationship between Sue and Carrie in the books and I really want to read more of that particularly.  Missing moments from their growing up together, etc.

&nbsp;

There's some schools of thought that suggest the little girl refereed to at the end of the novel is Carrie reborn, in a happier family and into a happier life.  I'd love to have that explored - a positive reincarnation for Carrie, meeting an adult Sue, who is perhaps now her teacher.

Give me some of Carrie's happy moments.  She had to have a few meager flickers of joy in her life.  Or Carrie as an angel or a ghost, roaming the streets of Chamberlin, confused.

Or maybe Sue, after the fact, dealing with adulthood, dealing with her own children.

Six of Crows Series - Leigh Bardugo 
Nikolai Lantsov (Six of Crows - Bardugo)

Reading the Six of Crows series and the Grisha Trilogy, the thing I left Bardugo’s universe most wanting was MORE NIKOLAI. I liked both series – Six of Crows more than Grisha Trilogy – but there was shockingly less Nikolai than I craved. 

Please fix this for me! Write me a story with Nikolai as the star, and I’ll be thrilled. Time period is up to you – I’m fine with anything from pre-Grisha Trilogy ‘young Nikolai has just left home’ to post-Six of Crows ‘and here is how Nikolai solves kingdom problems’. If you’re interested in Nikolai as a pirate (maybe a Princess Bride Dread Pirate Roberts feel?), so am I. If you’re interested in Nikolai mopping up the aftermath of the Grisha Trilogy, so am I. If you’re interested in Nikolai’s trip to Ketterdam in Six of Crows, so am I. You get the idea!

I’m not interested in any ships for Nikolai (except Nikolai/Ravka), or in any appearances by the Darkling. Canon ships for other people, particularly Six of Crows people, are fine in the background.

Other than that, I really want to leave your hand as free as possible, so if you have an idea of what you want to write already, please go right ahead! I also have some prompts in my letter.

Air Force One (1997) 
Kathryn Bennett

I love Vice President Bennett! For this fandom, I’d love a story about Kathryn set right around (or during) the movie. I want to know what she was thinking/experiencing!

Here are some prompts to get you started, although anything in this vein is fine.
•	What was Kathryn’s relationship with President Marshall like? Did they get along? Were they bitter primary opponents just now forging a closer bond? Did she agree with his speech?
•	The Cabinet is trying to pressure Kathryn into signing the declaration and becoming President. Is it a difficult decision? Would it be easier to just let herself be persuaded? What is her relationship with various Cabinet members like? Does she trust them?
•	Canon-divergence AU! Maybe Kathryn does sign. What’s that like when Marshall returns? Or maybe she doesn’t, and Marshall dies in the plane crash. Whatever happens, tell me what the aftershocks are!
•	After the movie, Kathryn goes home and tells her wife about her hellish day at the office.

Canon DNWs: Bennett in a het relationship (gen is fine, but otherwise f/f please!). I especially don't want Bennett/Marshall.

The Sims (Video Games) 

I’m a Sims 3 person. This game has given me so many hours of enjoyment, I swear. What I love most is the weird, wonderful, and quirky world. The career paths, the wishes (both lifetime and ordinary), the comical mishaps, and everything in between. Fighting mummies! Turning into plants! Having your Jimmy Sprocket book confiscated by the jail! 

I’m not interested in pre-set Sims characters and storylines, or in heavy emphasis on content from the Showtime, Late Night, or Supernatural expansions (those are the only three expansions I don’t own). In general I would prefer a Main Character who is female, and f/f relationships.

Apart from that, go to town! The Sims sandbox is so big and I’m really excited to see what you might do with it. I’m putting a few prompts in my letter in case you want a jumpstart or in case they remind you of something from one of your games, but really, if you have a different idea, feel free to ignore them entirely. :) Get as deeply Sims-nerdy as you like.

Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (Video Game) 
Carmen Sandiego (Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (Video Game))

Carmen Sandiego was one of my very first fictional crushes! I would love to read any fic about her kicking butt and taking names. My favorite iteration of the game is the one with the bumbling henchmen who have little silly cutscene adventures when you arrive in new destinations, and Carmen taunts you throughout – I think it’s the 1996 version. 

I’m most interested in gen casefic with Carmen running circles around the gumshoes (and getting away with her crimes – sorry, I am totally Team Carmen here). I love Carmen’s cat, and the bumbling henchmen, and the criminals on her crew that keep getting stupidly caught (can’t get good help these days!), but most of all I love Carmen and want all the silly, awesome, stylish, dastardly adventures. :D Anything that retains the canon style would be fantastic.

I’d also be okay with romance as long as it was f/f.

Madison Keys (Tennis RPF), Sloane Stephens (Tennis RPF)

Sloane &amp; Maddie!! I absolutely fell in love with these two women during the US Open this year. I’ve always liked both of them, but they were so fierce and awesome and played such amazing tennis this USO. Both of them coming back from injury, no less! Maddie had wrist surgery after Wimbledon, and Sloane couldn’t even walk a few month ago. They are inspiring, and fabulous, and fucking good at tennis, and good friends, and the medal ceremony after the final was the best medal ceremony EVER. So many jokes! So much banter! So cute!

I ship them mightily, and would love to read any cute flirting, falling-in-love, tennis-girlfriends story. When did they start flirting? Did they text to keep each other’s spirits up during their injuries? Did they encourage other during their comebacks (only to end up facing each other on the biggest stage)? Or did their relationship go from friends to lovers only during this USO? How might Maddie have congratulated Sloane for her victory? ETC.

See my letter for additional prompts! :)

Canon DNWs: CoCo Vandeweghe (except minor mentions of Maddie beating her), any American male tennis players appearing except Frances Tiafoe (that includes Jack Sock, Sloane’s ex), Donald Trump congratulating Sloane.

The prequel clips, \"The Last Supper\" ultimately, and articles and interviews with the cast left me hungry for backstory for Hallett and Lope. Lope bests Hallett in an arm wrestling challenge and the kisses him and promises he still loves him -- this is a couple who has been together for a time. And the movie gave us mere seconds.

I want to know they're backstory. How they met? What missions were they on together? Give me downtime together and the quiet moments. Or how they decided to take on the Covenant mission. Really I want more of pre-Covenant time with them, and whatever pings you I will be happy.

Animal Kingdom (TV) 
Deran Cody, Adrian (Animal Kingdom)

During season one, I wanted more of Adrian and Deran, but where we'd left wasn't in the best place. So that said I was thrilled that a happier and less-violent Deran has been around for season two. 

In my heart, I want Deran to follow Adrian on his trip and the guys to just never come back to the madness that is the Cody crime family, and they just live happily ever after surfing and making their living tending bar and working in a surf shop. And if that pings you, well all the better. But if we're matched on this fandom and pairing, and you adhere closer to canon -- I'd really love to see Deran and Adrian to have some time happy, reasonably law-abiding, and being able to be together. Even if it's a weekend/week/short time away from the rest of the world. 

I know they're not in an exclusive relationship currently in canon, and they've had some questionable encounters, but I would really prefer no violence, no dub-con, and no cheating.

I didn't include them in my character requests, but I am also fine with the inclusion of Hanzee Dent and Nikki Swango. 

I would love to see/read about the evolution of the partnership/friendship/romance (if you see it) of Wrench and Numbers. We've seen with season 2 that their history together goes back to childhood, and in my personal headcanon, Nikki and Wrench find a bond in having lost loved ones. So the story could be as expansive as Wrench and Numbers history from childhood until even after Numbers's death--or it could be short--a slice of life, a pwp -- whatever gets the muses talking/signing. 

Note: I'd really rather not have that slice being Numbers's death. It's canon and part of their story so I don't mind it being part of a longer story if that's what the muses want told, but I'd rather it not be the sole focus.

Westworld (TV) 
Dolores Abernathy, Maeve Millay, Bernard Lowe

These are all \"or\" choices, so it's not necessary to include all of them in your story.

I love the hosts in this show - however cliche the age-old dilemma of the whole concept of whether robots are more human than us or not is, I adore it. And I love how it's explored differently between these three characters:
Dolores was, arguably, made by Ford to have free will and her whole purpose is centered around that concept. Bernard genuinely thought he was human and truly believed he was making all his choices on his own free will, but now his whole identity is thrown into disarray as he tries to come to terms with who he is. Maeve, on the other hand, went through her whole journey of discovering who she really is and using it to her advantage, trying to find her daughter and be a free woman.

I don't have a specific prompt for this besides basically \"character study\" - just something very centric to one or more of these characters. Canon-compliant and divergent is okay, but I would prefer nothing wildly AU. Just something character-centric. Other people can be in the fic, of course - host or not - but I would prefer it to be one of these three.
All rating are fine. I don't have a preference for any ship in particular, but please, no rape/non-con.


Request 2 by poseidon
American Gods (TV) 

I love the whole mythological and spiritual concepts, the whole supernatural weirdness, how it all hinges on belief and devotion and everything like that. And the interpersonal relationships between the characters - moments that we the audience may or may not be privy to - that color their interactions and make for a richer narrative. I love that kind of stuff.

Honestly, I don't really have any prompt for this other than something that expounds upon some of these themes, something that canon doesn't show. Maybe Wednesday or some of the other gods in pre-canon, before the War started. Maybe something from Laura, Salim, and Sweeney's road trip. Maybe some moment between Shadow and Wednesday during their trip. Maybe something in the early days of Media, or Tech Boy, or Mr. World. Maybe something from Ifrit's backstory

Whatever you want is fine. I'm not against any particular ship (though I'm not a huge fan of Mad Sweeney/Shadow) but I would prefer no rape/non-con.

The Black Tapes Podcast 
Richard Strand (The Black Tapes Podcast)

Richard's life is a depressing tale, from what we've been told, but I like how we can see how his past has shaped his character and made him who he is. We also only ever see him through Alex's eyes and only whenever she's around, so we really have no idea what he's like when he's alone - lonely, I'd imagine, but you may have some different thoughts.

Something about his past before the Black Tapes started would be nice, such as his relationship with his father, how he started and stopped seeing the figure, how he met and lost Coralee, and how his life changed after that loss. Or, alternatively, what happened behind the scenes during the Black Tapes - what happened when he left Alex and tried to find who the Advocate was, what led to his breakdown, why wasn't he surprised to see Coralee.

Basically, I'd like something personal about Strand from his point of view. I don't have a preference for any ship in particular, so go wild.

GLOW (TV 2017) 
Debbie \"Liberty Belle\" Eagan

As a character, I like Debbie. She went through a lot - lost her best friend and husband in one day, then slowly built up new relationships with them throughout the season. She was playing the hero, the girl everyone likes, even though she wasn't particularly liked by everyone and she wasn't as perfect as she portrayed herself to be.

Once again, a very vague prompt, but I'd just like a general sort of character study about her and what changes she goes through during the season. Maybe a sort of focus on the different relationships she has - with Sam, with Cherry, with Carmen, and even with Ruth. Just showing her in a different light than what the show usually does.

I'm not against any particular ship, background or foreground (though Debbie/Ruth is fine) but I would prefer no rape/non-con.

What's Your Number? (2011) 
Colin Shea, Ally Darling

First, Colin Shea is a goddamn gift.

Second, I'm not sure exactly what sort of story I want in this fandom, so let me just tell you about my favourite scene in the movie. It's the one where Colin takes Ally to Boston Garden and they play strip horse.  And Ally cleans his clock.  Not because she had brothers who taught her to play.  Not because Colin lets her.  Just because she is better at basketball than he is and the movie gives that to her and Colin is totally cool with it.  And that is awesome.  (Also awesome is the fact that I'm a long time Celtics fan, so a nearly naked Chris Evans on the parquet of the Garden is the best.)

So basically, I'd love to see Ally showing her talents, Colin loving how talented she is and the two of them being adorable together.  And if you can work in a bit of basketball, I would be exceedingly grateful.

I'd love to see more of him and his grandmother together.  Margaret is the one in the family that seems to care for TJ most, and the one whose good opinion TJ most cares about.  And also I'd love to see more of his brother or his father trying to protect him, and more of his complicated relationship with his mother.

I would prefer no crossovers for this fandom alone. Not really interested in pre-canon things, but definitely okay with exploring canon moments from different angles etc.

Rick Martinez (The Martian 2015), Mark Watney (The Martian 2015), Chris Beck (The Martian 2015), Beth Johanssen (The Martian 2015)

Same as before - not explicit and no memory loss/forgetting.

Would love AUs for this - superpowers/superhero? Or mild AUs etc. For canon stuff, I would love stuff set during Mark's time on Mars, or them trying to help him cope with it afterwards. Social media fics are amazing, or at least ones that include that side. Happy for romantic pairings that go any way between Mark/Chris/Beth but please try and keep Rick out of any shipping.

Also not fussy if book or movie canon, so feel free to tag with either. Only picked movie cause more character options.

Bit of a broken record here but please not explicit and no memory loss/forgetting.

I am not at all fussed about which characters you write for this one, though I do really prefer you keep Beka and Farmer together because I do enjoy their relationship. And keep Tunstall and Goodwin platonic please, because I enjoy them as friends.

But other than that, feel free to go wild! Canon AU where Tunstall survives/doesn't go bad? Great! Stay in Canon and have them work through this? Also great! Future fic? Brilliant! Modern day AU? Also amazing. Any other type of AU? Also brilliant! 

I'm not fussy at all.

Alif the Unseen - G. Willow Wilson 

Anything for this fandom! Worldbuilding in the djinns' society; what other forms do they take or books have they encountered with unexpected encodings? Who else has Sheikh Bilal needed to give counsel to? What books does Alif recommend to Dina going forward, and which ones click? Does Intisar have more freedom going forward to affect the changes she wants? What about the convert and her child?

I'd love something that tries to include the tones of canon, but whether that incorporate explicitly fantasy elements or just the hopeful tones of the human characters can depend on the timeframe you choose--anything from the distant past to the future is cool with me. Please no religion-bashing.

Either allusions to specific levels from the original game or just generic \"oh no, it's a monster\" would be welcome. I'd be cool with either a shippy or a gen focus to Melinda and Chip's relationship.

The Prestige (2006) 

I'm fascinated by the dynamic of Borden and Angier's rivalry and how their hatred leads them in an ever-increasing pursuit of each other's destruction. I think a shippy take on this could be great, as could a gen one.

A couple spoilery AU scenarios that might be fun to explore:

-What if there were no duplicates, and Angier's \"with you awaiting execution for my murder\" was just that? His obsession with Borden leads him to kill himself in order to bring about Borden's death.
-The movement of the \"teleporter\" coincides with \"Borden's\" impending execution, so what if it really was a teleporter and Angier was reluctantly setting it up to whisk Borden away at the last moment, deciding he tolerated him after all? (Can be an AU in which there's only one \"Borden.\")

But again, anything goes for these characters. Please no incest.

Tacoma (Video Game) 

I would really be happy to read ANYTHING about any subset of these characters, who I fell enthusiastically in love with. I'm interested in what kinds of interactions they have after the game events. Some groupings of particular interest are Sareh and ODIN - are they able to keep talking? What is it like being a liberated AI? What do their futures look like? - and Bert and Nat - can they find an environment where they both feel happy and satisfied? Can Bert overcome her insecurities about not measuring up to Nat? Use these questions as a starting point if you like, but some of the most rewarding conversations in the game are between unexpected pairs of characters, so I'm very flexible. I read mostly gen, but sex is fine. DNW: Noncon/dubcon, and I'd rather not see anything bad happen to any of these characters that can't be resolved by the end of the fic.

Rhin is another character I fell deeply in love with.

What is it like to be back home, after all her strange experiences? Can her family understand? How does she manage to find the Last Castoff again? Will there be another reunion? Anything that does more exploration of her character as an adult would be wonderful. I'd happily read interactions between Rhin and any of the other characters, as well. I read mostly gen, but sex is fine (involving ADULT Rhin only, please). Angst is fine too, but I'd rather it not be too bleakly depressing. DNW: Noncon/dubcon.

Fate/Zero 
Arturia Pendragon | Saber (Fate/Zero), Lancelot of the Lake | Berserker (Fate/Zero)

King Arthur and Lancelot of the Lake are two people who, in any universe, never seem to be done with one another; I feel the same way about their Fate/Zero selves. Basically I'd love anything expanding on the tragic and evidently close Arturia/Lancelot relationship: I'd totally go for Camelotfic and/or any kind of canon-divergence AU that gives them more time and interaction in the Fourth War and/or a future meeting in a future war. I ship them romantically--I could see them as already involved, or as it being a one-way thing on Lancelot's part, but if you're not into it I'm also down with them as blood-brotherlike friends. I am also really into: the conflict over Guinevere, Arturia/Guinevere, Lancelot knowing (and loving?) Arthur as a man.

Lackadaisy 
Mitzi May, Mordecai Heller

The meaty backstory of Lackadaisy is where it's at for me as a canon--I love everything that's hinted at and everything we learn in drips and drabs; it's a story very much steeped in history. I especially love Mitzi and Mordecai's charged, half-sibling-like relationship, and all the entanglement concerning them and Atlas: the betrayal, the resentment, the bitterness, the unspoken and unresolved business. They're my two favorite Lackadaisy characters and I would be happy with either speculative backstory fic about them, fic that takes place in the present/future of the Lackadaisy timeline, or canon-divergent AU fic of some kind. I love how Atlas basically made each of them, picked them up from their respective backgrounds and shaped them, for good or for ill, into the people they are now--but I'm also interested in how they made themselves, and each other. I do ship them, but I'd also be happy with a gen interpretation of their relationship.

I am all, 100%, totally here for the dark mess that is David and Shaw's relationship--starting in Prometheus, ending before Covenant, outlasting all of that in David's fractured psyche. I love her conflicted feelings about him, her distrust and animosity giving way to fondness and pity after a fashion, and some kind of friendship, before everything turns awful between them; I love his obsession, his childlike love and violence and cruelty. Given that, I don't expect any kind of favorable interpretation of their relationship or even a reciprocal one: if you want to go that way, particularly in AU, I'd be happy, but it's by no means required. I'd love anything that explores what happened, the why (and how, if you want to go dark) of how he killed her, her POV on him or his delusional POV on her--or an AU where something else happens, and things go differently.

I love how Naoya has certain expectations of the way Abel will play the game, and Abel can either support him or go in a completely new direction. I'd love canon divergence or post-8th day exploration of their relationship, either somewhat antagonistic with Messiah Abel or Naoya's attentiveness in the Chaos route. Ship-wise, I'd love Naoya using Abel's feelings to try and manipulate him down a path, or finding his own partiality to Abel is making him doubt his plans for him, or worry about him post-game.

Oniisama E 
Asaka Rei, Misonoo Nanako

If you matched me here, the dealbreaker triggers in my Dear Yuletide letter might make you ask, \"What am I supposed to do with this?!\" I won't ask you to ignore the emotional trauma in this story. One thing that appeals to me in Oniisama E is the indomitability of the human spirit. Characters suffer, break, even lose hope, but they don't stay down. Orihara Kaoru is one of my favorite characters, a bastion of clear-headed priorities amid chaos, treachery, and bullying, but my favorite relationship is between Nanako and Saint-Just. I have a not-so-secret place in my heart where I am constantly yearning for *happy* Saint-Just/Nanako fic. I understand that their little love affair ends in tragedy, but it would make me so happy to see some moment when they had a nice day, and things weren't a complete trainwreck. Heck, reincarnation fic or some AU where they get to live happily ever after would suit me just fine, too. This also goes against my usual desire to see something less shippy for Yuletide. This pairing is the big weakness of my sappy, shippy heart.

I love the tragedy of their story in canon. It's beautiful, it's poignant, it's so emotionally true to human experience while being so poetically dramatic; but if you can find a way to work in one happy day while keeping the series true to itself, I would be forever grateful (and there are, of course, many definitions of happiness depending on the people involved). And if you say... no, I'm sorry, it's impossible to put a happy day into this relationship given the established timeline, that's fine, too. I love Saint-Just and Nanako just the way they are.

I love how dangerous Saint-Just is, to herself and to the world around her, and it crushes my heart (in that tragic, beautiful way) to see her cowed by Miya-sama and trying to remove herself from the world time and time again -- not just actively with suicide attempts and drug addiction, but in her behavior where she retreats to the bell tower, to her apartment, playing hooky from class and school, setting herself apart from any potential friends with bravado.

I love that Nanako is unsure and blindsided by so many unthinkable things, but her attraction to Saint-Just is something simple that she never doubts or treats as wrong. I love that even when she's trying to save Saint-Just's life by giving her something half-way nutritious to eat or pulling her back from a ledge, she's not doing it to try and normalize her, or out of a fantasy that Saint-Just will ever be a sweet girlfriend, nor is she infantalizing Saint-Just to make herself a caretaker. She's in love with a dangerous trainwreck, and I think that may be one of the most comforting things in her life at that point based on the way she acts in those scenes versus the way she acts at school or with her family. It's an interesting frame of mind. I'd love to see more about it.

Fascination, which becomes devotion, then understanding, and could perhaps have become love. I wish I could read even one story where there's some sense that they could be good for each other, although Saint-Just can't be saved. And please don't feel compelled to make Nanako an eternal innocent little lamb. The fact that she grows into a sense of self, can consider what's before her and make strong choices (which may be the choice to be kind) is also an important part of the story. She doesn't want to be Saint-Just's sister the way she wanted her teacher half-brother to be her brother. This is a total contrast, someone she wants to be her lover. She's a girl having a coming of age, including her sexual awakening through her interest in Saint-Just (although I don't need them to have sex, clearly even a cigarette-butt indirect kiss is a huge deal for them).

Really, all I want is to see them together, and hear what you feel about the way they affect each other. &lt;3 I also love all the other characters, so please feel free to include them if you see fit!

The Handmaid's Tale (TV) 
June Osborne | Offred (Handmaid's Tale (TV))

If you're offering for Handmaid's Tale, I assume you're as mindblown as I was by the exquisite production and heartwrenching emotional resonance of the TV series. Please, please tell me more about how you think these people survive their everyday lives, and who they are as people in ways that Gilead can't take away from them. Speculative fic about what might come in Season 2 or later is okay, too! And I have read the book, so if you decide to include setting details from there, including the \"appendix\" written after the fall of Gilead, that's no problem.

I'm only requesting June/Offred as a character because she's the one I want to hear about most, but I don't want to limit you in terms of who she's interacting with. I am okay with all canon romantic pairings, including June/Luke and June/Nick. I believe she loves them both. I would strongly request that there be no implication that she is in love with Fred Waterford or in any way willing to be in a relationship. She identifies \"the Ceremony\" as rape. Please respect that, no matter what she has to say to survive. I'm not here for the Stockholms. Since June positively identifies as heterosexual, I would prefer no romantic relationship between her and Moira, between her and Serena Joy, or between her and Emily/Ofglen. That said, I am VERY interested in the friendships between June &amp; Moira or June &amp; Emily (or between any of the Handmaids - or the Marthas for that matter!), and the complex relationship between June and Serena Joy as women who aren't that different in many ways but worlds apart in the ways that would allow them to trust one another is an absolute masterpiece in this version of the story. In general, the idea of allyship between women is a huge theme, of which I can't get enough. Obviously, it would be too much to put all of these relationships into one story, but whatever interests you most, I'm very interested to read!

Paper Girls (Comics) 
Erin Tieng

I would love a story where something weird is happening! And someone has an emotion?

This comic is such a mishmash of elements, but I love the girls.  I picked Erin to request because I was so struck by her encounter with her older self but really I'd be happy with a story about any of them.  

As of writing this, I have read the first two trade paperback collections, and will read the third one soon.  I'm not worried about spoilers, if you want to incorporate stuff from more recent issues; I'm also happy for you to ignore everything recent and just base your story off of volume one.  Whatever part of the canon made you think you'd like to write in this fandom, feel free to focus on that.  I feel like a good way to write a Paper Girls story might be to not worry about trying to fit your story into canon, or trying to make the plot make sense, but just to drop some or all of the girls into the middle of some sort of situation without explanation.  I will 100% buy anything as completely plausible - sure, they're riding a mammoth now! They found a baby! They're on a gameshow! They're hiding in an abandoned amusement park! They're in space! Why not! Or else the Six Months Later approach (or however long).  I would prefer that they've all survived their adventures.

In my heart, none of them are straight, even if they haven't all realized that yet, about themselves or each other.  Lesbian? Bi? Ace? Nonbinary? I'm happy with a story where they still don't know, where figuring out names for their identities is still some time in the future (and I certainly wouldn't think 12 year olds in 1988 would have even heard words like asexual or nonbinary yet, based on my own memories of being 10 in 1988).  Or a story where that's irrelevant because they're too busy fighting robot squid or playing with a shrink ray or a transmogrifier or whatever.  But I would love a kiss or some hand holding, or two characters talking about a third (in a gossip way? in a crush way?).  Please nothing beyond kissing, if they're 12.

Wonder Woman (2017) 
Diana Prince (Wonder Woman 2017), Isabel Maru (Wonder Woman 2017)

I would love to know more about Dr. Maru - how much of what we saw in the movie was her innate personality, and how much was the influence of Ares? What might she do with her scientific gifts once she's on her own and away from that influence? I would be happy with a story where Wonder Woman has to fight her again or a story where they team up or a story where Diana tries to seduce her over to the side of good (or into seeing her own potential or beauty or something).  I also really love Etta Candy so something like Etta meeting Maru or Diana talking to Etta about Maru could be interesting.

As far as shipping, I am very fond of Diana/Steve, but I like to think of Diana as having inherited some of Zeus's tendency to get around, except that unlike Zeus Diana would find it unthinkable to do anything without positive consent and is good for her lovers, like, anyone she's with is going to end up feeling good about it. But I see her as being able to find something to love in many people and as liking to have one-night stands, sex friends, longer non-exclusive relationships, etc.  It's completely fine to ignore this if this is not your Diana, but I would rather there not be an emphasis on the language of monogamy, one true loves, etc, if there's any sex or romance.

Home Again (2017) 
Alice Kinney

So I don't have a fixed idea about what happens after this movie, but the one future I *don't* believe is \"and then none of these people ever had sex with each other again, the end\".  Does Alice ever see George in a different light? Do Harry and George hook up and talk about Alice? One of the guys comes to Alice with a newly-discovered kink they only feel safe exploring with her? Alice gets a threesome or foursome with the guys? Harry and Teddy realize they like being sister-wives? Who is the first of the three to successfully take Alice on a date outside the house, and how many other failed attempts are there first?  I love the wish-fulfillment aspect of her having this harem of nice, attractive young men, and their attraction to her competence and energy.

If you really don't want to write anything with sex or relationships,  maybe something about an interior design job that Alice is really proud of, for an interesting client? Or Alice and the guys all dropping Isabel off at her first school dance?

I would prefer that Austen not appear or be mentioned in this story, boo Austen.

Count of Monte Cristo (2002) 
Mercédès Mondego (Count of Monte Cristo (2002)), Edmond Dantès (Count of Monte Cristo (2002)), Albert Mondego (Count of Monte Cristo (2002))

I love the relationship with the new family unit we see of Edmond, Mercedes, and Albert, but I'm sad canon didn't explore interactions between all three of them much beyond the whole Fernand is a drunken jerk, now he's dead, and flash forward to we're on a cliffside having resolved all our personal issues apparently to become a happy family. So something with the three of them either during the time jump or after it when they're figuring out what to do now that REVENGE! is over. 

I'm also interested in alternate universe explorations of their family - what if Edmond had figured out about Albert before Mercedes told Fernand and how would that have changed his plans? Or if Albert had been slightly smarter and realized, \"Wait, maybe this drunken layabout isn't my real dad since my mom keeps pining over this dead sailor dude? Perhaps I should confide my troubles in this deeply supportive count/father figure and he will give me advice?” Or if it turned out that Mercedes was also into the whole REVENGE! thing and she was one step ahead of Edmond on that front? 

I'm not really into Fernand, because I'm really looking for fic focused on Edmond, Mercedes, and Albert and their familial relationship, so if you use him, please do so sparingly. Please no deathfic for the nominated characters. Minor characters are fine.

Scream of the Wolf (1974) 
John Weatherby, Byron Douglas

So I can pinpoint the exact moment I fell in love with this movie - right when John Weatherby (Peter Graves) and Byron Douglas (Clint Walker) had an arm wrestling match to determine if they were going to go hunt down werewolves. So manly, so dramatic, so filled with sexual tension - I might have squealed. Please give me more of this dynamic - the push-pull of Graves' retired hunter with Walker trying to lure him back into the fold. For example, it made me wonder what their history was. How did they meet? What did they hunt together? When did Byron realize he was madly in love with John? Or, later on in the movie, what would their future have been like if John had gone away with Byron to South America like he wanted? It seemed like that was his real desire, not randomly playing \"The Most Dangerous Game\" with some dogs at the end. 

Speaking of which, I alternately loved and was frustrated how wonderfully Scooby Doo this is - it was sort of sad to me at the end that there was no actual werewolf considering this was made by Dan Curtis, who knows a thing or two about the supernatural. So what if Byron had really been a werewolf all along? How would that have changed things, especially given his weird possessiveness with John? 

Really, I just love the two of them together, so I don't really want either one of them to die in the story itself. Minor character death is fine, given the nature of this canon.

Sword Art Online Abridged 
Yuuki Asuna | Asuna (SAO Abridged), Kirigaya Kazuto | Kirito (SAO Abridged), Kayaba Akihiko | Heathcliff (SAO Abridged)

I love the interplay between Kirito, Asuna, and Kayaba in this version so much - Kirito and Asuna's manipulative, codependent, murderous love that leads them to both acts of petty bickering and great sacrifice, Kayaba's exasperation in knowing that the only people that can understand him are infuriating teenagers who haven't even watched Dungeonmaster, and Asuna and Kirito realizing in turn that Kayaba is just as \"screwed-up as the rest of us,\" which could be said for any child realizing that your parent is also a person. So I'd love something about the three of them together as some sort of messed-up family - maybe Kirito and Asuna drag Kayaba to a movie night/therapy session/gaming con and the three of them proceed to torment everyone else.

And Kayaba is on the run from the law, probably, so does he decide to team up with the two best sociopaths he knows to figure out a way out of his mess. Should Bethesda worry about pissed-off nerds with admin privileges?

There's also room for hijinks during the show - Kirito was a member of the guild for a few seconds after all, so how did that work? Was it like herding cats to keep Asuna and Kirito from killing each other and everyone else in the guild? Did they go on any missions together and how well did that work out? Was there virtual drinking involved? 

I'd like something fun, so I'd rather not have any major character death. NPCs and minor characters are fine.

Sleeping Beauty (1959) 
Phillip (Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty (1959))

Phillip and Maleficent are one of my favorite villain-hero pairings for so many reasons - she's cool and wicked and likes to turn into a dragon, he's stalwart and charming and keeps getting into bondage scenes. So I'd love something exploring their relationship. She did promise to keep him chained up in her dungeon a while, after all, and who's to say she might not change her mind about keeping him herself (and maybe preserving his strapping good looks along the way)?  Or what if she didn't die at the end - she is a powerful fairy after all? Would she get revenge and how would that play out?

I'm also fond of thinking about pre-canon AUs. What if Aurora wasn't the only one cursed - or cursed at all? What if it was Phillip and he got to hang out with small woodland creatures while waiting for his true love? Does a strangely alluring woman show up and take him away before he can think too hard about someone hitting on you with the line \"once upon a dream?\"  Or what if it no one gets cursed at all - just a young prince whose kingdom is attacked by an evil fairy one day who only asks for one thing. 

Feel free to be as explicit as you want but please no PWP. Also, I'm still fond of Aurora, so if you do include references to her, no bashing. Lastly, please don't use characterization/plot from the live action Disney version.

The Administration - Manna Francis 
Keir Warrick, Val Toreth

Where to even begin? Basically, anything you write about these two will make me very, very happy. I just love their whole dynamic. I'd love something plot-y with Warrick in peril and Toreth losing his shit. Or something porn-y. But basically, my very favorite thing is when Warrick actually asserts a claim on Toreth (like when he tells him he'd put him in the regeneration tank, or the \"you seem to have hold of something of mine\" line!) and when he's all, \"You just don't understand him like I do! You're not going to break us up! We're in looove!!!\"

And my other most favorite thing is when Toreth does something he wouldn't normally do because he's doing it for Warrick. And somewhere he vaguely understands that it is important to do nice things for Warrick so long as no one looks at him or says anything about it!

As far as prompts, I'd love anything about them living together. I'd get a kick out of a story set a few years down the line with rebellious teenage Valeria coming for a visit and \"Uncle Val\" (heh) remains just as bizarrely good with her. I would love Toreth with a cold or a fever and Warrick attempting to nurse him. I would love Warrick getting kidnapped or imperiled in some way and Toreth having to save the day. (But please don't actually seriously harm Warrick!) Or anything, really. Anything at all. Bonus points for Sara. Double bonus points if she's being all insightful about the relationship.

 Mistry, B-C, Chevril and others welcome, but no Carnac, please, unless you find him as loathsome and evil as I do.

And of course sex would be great.
